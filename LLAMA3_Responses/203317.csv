   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with
   trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit with hypotension and positive blood and sputum
   cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - cont home colistin.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 100.4 Axillary, workup as above
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother when able
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.  Will continue to
   monitor.
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.
   # FEN. Tube feeds, nutrition consult in for regimen similar to that at
   [**Hospital1 **]
   # PPx: HSQ, H2 blocker.
   # Access: R femoral TLC.  L sided PICC.
   # Communication.  Mother [**Name (NI) 249**] is HCP; number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3958**];
   unable to reach on [**2137-8-6**].
   # Dispo.  ICU pending stability of BP, treatment of ?infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 118 bpm
* Blood pressure: 100/51 mmHg (63/57 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has a history of HIV and has been on HAART for 4 months. The patient has also had a positive CD4 count of 17 prior to HAART, which suggests that the patient may be at high risk for infection.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 250 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs or gallops
* Respiratory: Normal lung sounds, no wheezing or rhonchi
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: No cyanosis or clubbing
* Skin: Warm, no rash
* Neurologic: No meningismus, no focal neurologic deficits

The patient's medical history includes:

* HIV/AIDS
* PML
* Indwelling line (PICC) placed unclear time period
* History of EtOH abuse
* FEN tube feeds
* Nutrition consult for regimen similar to that at [**Hospital1 **]
* PPx: HSQ, H2 blocker

The patient's medications include:

* HAART
* Atovaquone
* Mefloquine
* Colistin
* Acetaminophen
* K+ SS
* Mag SS
* Famotidine
* Heparin
* Metoprolol
* Scopolamine patch

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/51 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. The patient is being treated with vasopressors and fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.
* Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood and sputum cultures, which suggests bacteremia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Sepsis: The patient's temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), which is above normal. The patient is being treated with acetaminophen and fluid boluses.
* Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, which is considered anemia. The patient is being monitored and will continue to receive blood transfusions as needed.
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: The patient has a history of PML, which is a complication of HIV/AIDS. The patient's mental status is poor, and the patient is being monitored for any changes.
* Airway management: The patient has a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's airway is being monitored for any changes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures suggest bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis.
* Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level can lead to anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: The patient's history of PML can lead to progressive neurologic impairment, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and memory loss.
* Airway management: The patient's tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation can lead to airway complications, such as pneumonia, tracheitis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Fluid overload: The patient's fluid boluses and vasopressors can lead to fluid overload, which can cause edema, hypertension, and cardiac failure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for infection and sepsis due to his positive blood and sputum cultures, and his history of HIV/AIDS and PML. The patient's anemia and airway management are also concerns. The patient's potential medical complications include sepsis, anemia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, airway management, and fluid overload."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 as above
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - discussion with mother regarding goals of care
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 as above
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - discussion with mother regarding goals of care
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother today
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Repeat hct 1500
   -          Further w/u following results

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and sputum cultures are pending, but they have a history of PML and are immunocompromised, making them at high risk for sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 90s, and they have received multiple liters of normal saline boluses to maintain blood pressure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypotension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a tracheostomy and is on oxygen therapy, but their respiratory status is unstable, and they require close monitoring.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 24.9 to 22.5, and they have received a transfusion of packed red blood cells. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): The patient has a history of PML, and their mental status is poor. Further evaluation is needed to determine the progression of the disease.
6. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is on antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Further evaluation is needed to determine the effectiveness of HAART and the patient's CD4 count.
7. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's temperature has been elevated, and no clear source has been identified. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.
8. Potential for aspiration: The patient has a tracheostomy and is at risk for aspiration due to their altered gag reflex and copious secretions.
9. Potential for septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the 90s, and they have received multiple liters of normal saline boluses to maintain blood pressure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypotension and the risk of septic shock.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin for gram-positive coverage
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for gram-negative coverage
* Famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis
* Acetaminophen for fever control
* Atovaquone for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
* Mefloquine for prophylaxis against malaria
* HAART for HIV/AIDS treatment

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.2
* Hemoglobin: 24.8
* Platelet count: 187

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - cont home colistin.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 100.4 Axillary, workup as above
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother when able
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.  Will continue to
   monitor.
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a fever of 101.6°F (38.7°C) and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/48 mmHg). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of allergies to dapsone, abdominal pain, and antibiotic use. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic, with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia and antibiotic use.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea (rapid breathing rate) and hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation) may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of abdominal pain and antibiotic use may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and white blood cell count may indicate infection, which can lead to sepsis and death if not treated promptly.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney damage, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and death if not treated promptly.
7. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which can lead to liver failure and death if not treated promptly.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and death if not treated promptly.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical history to identify any potential complications and provide prompt treatment to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall individual weighing 85.5 kg, who is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of allergies to Dapsone, Abdominal pain, and Bactrim DS.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 100 bpm (87-120 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/48 mmHg (58-103/68 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (12-26 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has received various medications, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Famotidine (Pepcid), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 187 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL
* Other lab results: see below

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to respond or move. The patient's skin, peripheral vascular, and neurologic examinations were not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
* Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
* Tachycardia, other
* Anemia, chronic

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

* Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's inability to protect their airway
* Sepsis due to the patient's fever and hypotension
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and hypoxemia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's anemia and chronic bleeding disorder
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors
* Stress ulcer due to the patient's critical illness and risk factors
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Infection due to the patient's fever and risk factors

Based on the patient's condition and risk factors, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications and adjust the patient's treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Blood and urine cultures pending.
   - Resent sputum culture, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count
   (pending).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; keep femoral
   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep lines in pending cx results, given chronic course of
   current illness.
   # Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but
   with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - can check sputum cultures, but unclear if treatment warranted given
   lack of infiltrate.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 as above
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - discussion with mother regarding goals of care
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR am of [**8-8**]
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - give low dose BB for now, being careful to avoid exacerbating
   hypotension.
   - received 3+ Liters NS boluses, with good response in BP, but HR
   continues to be 100-120
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - Recheck CD4
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Mefloquine
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother today
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Repeat hct 1500
   -          Further w/u following results
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   line for now but if CVL needed for few days can change to IJ/SC.
   - Consider non-infectious causes of hypotension (ROMI,
   bleed/hypovolemia).
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - f/u cultures as above

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; d/c femoral
   line today.
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR

   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; d/c femoral
   line today.
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.

   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and a tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His baseline blood pressure is reportedly in the mid-90s, but has been in the 90s to 100s since admission. He has advanced HIV with no recent CD4 count, making him at high risk for infection.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP >65 mmHg

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Genital: unresponsive, appears in normal alert and responsive state (NAD)
* Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT): tracheostomy in place, copious secretions, eyes open
* Chest: ronchorous breath sounds bilaterally
* Cardiovascular (CV): regular rate and rhythm (RRR)
* Abdomen (Abd): soft, non-tender (ND)
* Extremities (Ext): bl upper extremity (UE) mildly edematous, trace edema bl lower extremity (LE)
* Skin: warm and dry
* Neuro/Psych: unresponsive to verbal stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 4.2
* Hematocrit (Hct): 25.5
* Platelet count (Plt): 200,000/μL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.3/28.6/1.2, CK/CKMB: 21/<0.01, ALT/AST: 35/32, Alk Phos/T Bili: 78/0.4, Amylase/Lipase: 24/22, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, LDH: 233 IU/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): lungs grossly clear, possible small left pleural effusion, heart size at upper end of normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition and treatment include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures, along with his hypotension and tachycardia, suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: Despite the patient's negative sputum culture, his history of multiple pulmonary infections and immunosuppression make pneumonia a potential complication.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia, likely related to his HIV/AIDS and HAART therapy, may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, may persist and require further management.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia, likely related to his sepsis and hypotension, may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) may worsen, leading to neurological deterioration.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring mechanical ventilation.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to address these potential complications and provide appropriate management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. They have a history of allergies to dapsone and Bactrim DS. They received antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin, and are currently receiving Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis and Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.8°C, Tcurrent of 36.4°C, HR of 101 bpm, BP of 99/61 mmHg, RR of 14 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. They are receiving oxygen therapy via a tracheal mask and have a stable respiratory status.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 200 K/uL. Their liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an AST of 32 IU/L and an ALT of 35 IU/L. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain areas, including their peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems. They are at risk for aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of abdominal pain and antibiotics, there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status may indicate respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia make them at risk for bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL suggests potential renal impairment.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which requires close monitoring and management.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate infection, which requires prompt evaluation and treatment.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and their nutritional status require close monitoring and management to prevent malnutrition.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - follow CXR
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - follow CXR
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His baseline blood pressure is in the mid-90s, but he has had episodes of hypotension, including one reading of 84/52 mmHg. He has been afebrile overnight and is currently being monitored. His blood cultures are pending, and he has been discontinued from antibiotics as he has been afebrile with no identifiable source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures, along with his hypotension and fever, suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's positive sputum cultures and lack of clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of bacteremia. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
4. HIV-related infections: The patient's advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression make him at high risk for opportunistic infections. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's PML and poor mental status make him at high risk for neurological complications. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
6. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and recent transfusion suggest the possibility of ongoing bleeding or blood loss. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count suggests the possibility of bleeding or blood loss. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
8. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance suggests the possibility of dehydration or fluid overload. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's tracheostomy and copious secretions suggest the possibility of respiratory complications. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension suggest the possibility of cardiac complications. Further workup and treatment are needed to address this potential complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - Vanco and zosyn for GNR coverage for now while awaiting cultures.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - LP likely low yield, will reconsider if w/u negative
   - If appearing septic; goal direceted therapy with fluid boluses,
   pressors to keep MAP >65, Aline placement, [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results; d/c femoral
   line today.
   - Will give low dose beta block for now, increase as BP tolerates back
   to home dose.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Coverage with vanco.
   - HD monitoring as above.
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - Will continue zosyn for now.
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - follow CXR
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - continue 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy in a different facility. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His baseline blood pressure is in the mid-90s, and he has a history of low-grade temperatures. He is at high risk for infection due to his advanced HIV and lack of recent CD4 count. He has an indwelling line of unclear duration and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for Gram-negative rod coverage.

The patient's lab results show anemia, chronic macrocytic likely due to HAART. He has a history of ethanol abuse and is currently in a skilled nursing facility with no concern for withdrawal issues.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm (89-114)
* Blood pressure: 92/62 mmHg (69-111/77)
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (11-25)
* SpO2: 99%

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood and sputum cultures, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of positive sputum cultures and is at risk for bacteremia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary infections and is at risk for pneumonia.
4. Neurological impairment: The patient has progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which can lead to neurological impairment.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic macrocytic anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has a tracheostomy and is at risk for respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of tachycardia and is at risk for cardiovascular instability.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Continue treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for Gram-negative rod coverage.
3. Consider further workup for sepsis, including blood cultures and imaging studies.
4. Consider treatment for PML, including antiviral therapy and corticosteroids.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider treatment for hypotension if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
8. Consider treatment for cardiovascular instability, including beta blockers and vasopressors if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a multi-lumen femoral line inserted. The patient has a history of abdominal pain and allergies to Dapsone and Bactrim DS. They have been receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and have been monitored for fluid balance, vital signs, and laboratory results.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/62 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheal mask and have a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PO2 of 60 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 193 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium level of 136 mEq/L, and chloride level of 101 mEq/L. Their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25.5 mg/dL, and their creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, which may be related to their underlying condition. They are at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and airway clearance due to their inability to protect their airway. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, they may be at risk for sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway puts them at risk for aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's risk for DVT is increased due to their immobility and the presence of central lines. This could lead to pulmonary embolism and subsequent respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's risk for stress ulcer is increased due to their critical illness and the use of corticosteroids. This could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases their risk for VAP, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and end-stage renal disease.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of underlying cardiac disease. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications that may arise, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of their ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/62 mmHg. He is receiving antibiotics, and his sputum and blood cultures are pending. He has a history of multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, and his CD4 count is 53. He is on HAART and atovaquone for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures and hypotension make sepsis a potential complication.
2. Pneumonia: Despite no clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, the patient's history of multiple pulmonary infections and positive sputum cultures make pneumonia a potential complication.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia, likely caused by HAART, may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion.
4. HIV-related infections: The patient's advanced HIV and immunosuppression make him at high risk for opportunistic infections, such as PCP.
5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): The patient's diagnosis of PML is a significant complication, and further neurological deterioration is possible.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to his underlying condition, medications, or other factors.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheostomy and copious secretions make respiratory failure a potential complication.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition, likely due to his underlying condition and inadequate nutrition, may worsen his overall health.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and chronic anemia make gastrointestinal bleeding a potential complication.
10. Infection-related complications: The patient's multiple infections and immunosuppression make infection-related complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and abscesses, a potential risk."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of HIV, admitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 193 K/uL. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is also within normal limits, with an albumin level of 2.7 g/dL and a total bilirubin level of 0.4 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CXR, show no significant change.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has continued, but it does not appear to have acute worsening over the past 24 hours, which argues against persistent infection.
* HIV: The patient's HIV medications will be continued.
* Airway, inability to protect: The patient's airway is at risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, and cough.
* ICU care: The patient will continue to receive nutrition via a PICC line, and his glycemic control will be monitored. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer will also be continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Hypotension: Prolonged hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for bleeding complications.
* HIV: The patient is at risk for opportunistic infections and complications related to HIV.
* Airway, inability to protect: The patient is at risk for aspiration, respiratory failure, and other complications related to his airway status.
* ICU care: The patient is at risk for complications related to his ICU care, including catheter-related infections, pressure ulcers, and other issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct
   -
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

   Disposition: In ICU until placed<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, and his CD4 count is 53, indicating a high risk for infection. He is on HAART, but his last CD4 count was prior to HAART, and his current CD4 count is unknown.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F) (normal)
* Heart rate: 103 bpm (normal)
* Blood pressure: 94/53 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (normal)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal)
* Blood glucose: 106 mg/dL (normal)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 4.2 x 10^9/L (normal)
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL (anemia)
* Platelet count: 234 x 10^9/L (normal)
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (normal)
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL (normal)
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL (normal)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is 94/53 mmHg, which is hypotensive. The patient is at risk for infection due to his advanced HIV and indwelling line.
* BACTEREMIA: The patient has positive blood cultures, and his blood pressure is hypotensive.
* HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME, AIDS): The patient has advanced HIV/AIDS, and his CD4 count is 53.
* PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML): The patient has a history of PML, which is a rare complication of HIV/AIDS.
* ANEMIA, CHRONIC: The patient has chronic anemia, likely due to HAART.

The patient's medications include:

* HAART: The patient is on HAART, which is a combination of antiretroviral medications.
* Metoprolol: The patient is taking Metoprolol 100 mg QID, which is a large increase from his previous dose.
* Atovaquone: The patient is taking atovaquone for prophylaxis.
* Famotidine: The patient is taking famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Heparin: The patient is taking heparin for prophylaxis.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Infection: The patient is at high risk for infection due to his advanced HIV and indwelling line.
* Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures, and his blood pressure is hypotensive, which increases his risk for sepsis.
* Pneumonia: The patient has positive sputum cultures, and his CXR is stable, but he has a history of multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance.
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): The patient has a history of PML, which is a rare complication of HIV/AIDS.
* Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may worsen if his CD4 count decreases.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is hypotensive, which may worsen if his CD4 count decreases.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue HAART and atovaquone for prophylaxis.
* Decrease Metoprolol to 37.5 mg TID.
* Monitor for hypotension and tachycardia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's CD4 count and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
* Consider a head CT or LP for workup of fever if the patient's mental status worsens.
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct
   -

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed no growth, though no evidence of infiltrate on CXR
   (unlikely to treat based on likely colonization).
   - Urine showed no growth
   - D/c antibiotics today as has been afebrile with no identifiable
   source.
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Will titrate down to
   Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive culture several weeks ago; was on vanco in
   past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how old.
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   - hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile overnight
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and a tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/53 mmHg. He is receiving antibiotics, but they will be discontinued as he has been afebrile with no identifiable source of infection. He has a CD4 count of 53, which may put him at high risk for infection. He is also receiving treatment for PCP prophylaxis and has a PICC line in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and history of PML make him at high risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of sepsis early.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of PML make him at high risk for infection. Close monitoring of his laboratory results and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of infection early.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of his platelet count and bleeding symptoms is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypovolemic shock. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and fluid status is necessary to detect any signs of hypovolemic shock early.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of PML and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy make him at high risk for neurological complications. Close monitoring of his neurological status and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of neurological complications early.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of tracheostomy and chronic respiratory disease make him at high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary to detect any signs of respiratory failure early.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of HIV/AIDS and cardiovascular disease make him at high risk for cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of his cardiovascular status and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of cardiovascular complications early."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   - not responsive to  pain today
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct
   -
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Will keep PICC in for now
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct
   -
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

   Microbiology: Sputum--Patient with return of Pseudomonas on culture
   [**2137-8-10**].
   Assessment and Plan
   36 yo male admit with hypotension and now with reasonable improvement
   in BP with IVF given.  He has had response quite rapidly in the setting
   of antibiotics but with such rapid return to baseline and absence of
   culture results have discontinued Vanco/Zosyn with continued good
   hemodynamic response.  The one concerning finding is the evolution of
   pseudomonas on sputum sample returning yesterday.  In addition
patient
   has evolution and persistence of increased pulmonary secretions which
   this morning are associated with intermittent desaturations.  This
   would argue for ongoing signficiant bacterial infection and would
   presume that it is at least the pseudomonas found in his sputum.
   Hypotension-
   -Maintained baseline blood pressure at this time.
   HIV-
   -Continue with HAART therapy as prescribed
   Pneumonia-Ongoing sputum production, Pseudomonas seen
   -Will Rx with Cefepime
   -Follow up cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Microbiology: Sputum--Patient with return of Pseudomonas on culture
   [**2137-8-10**].
   Assessment and Plan
   36 yo male admit with hypotension and now with reasonable improvement
   in BP with IVF given.  He has had response quite rapidly in the setting
   of antibiotics but with such rapid return to baseline and absence of
   culture results have discontinued Vanco/Zosyn with continued good
   hemodynamic response.  The one concerning finding is the evolution of
   pseudomonas on sputum sample returning yesterday.  In addition
patient
   has evolution and persistence of increased pulmonary secretions which
   this morning are associated with intermittent desaturations.  This
   would argue for ongoing signficiant bacterial infection and would
   presume that it is at least the pseudomonas found in his sputum.
   Hypotension-
   -Maintained baseline blood pressure at this time.
   HIV-
   -Continue with HAART therapy as prescribed
   Pneumonia-Ongoing sputum production, Pseudomonas seen
   -Will Rx with Cefepime
   -Follow up cultures

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 93/56 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of allergies to dapsone and Bactrim DS.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, and the patient's sputum culture is also positive for Pseudomonas.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lung fields, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The patient is receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and hepatitis B treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes continued antibiotics for Pseudomonas pneumonia, monitoring of blood cultures, and continuation of pulmonary toilet. The patient is also receiving nutrition support with Nutren 2.0.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated LDH suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's positive sputum culture and elevated LDH suggest the possibility of infection-related complications, such as abscesses or empyema.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and need for nutrition support increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to impaired wound healing, increased risk of infection, and death.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and AIDS-related complications, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
7. Hepatitis B-related complications: The patient's HBV infection increases the risk of liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.

   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).

   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, and the current sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas. The patient is at high risk for sepsis due to advanced HIV and indwelling lines.
2. Pneumonia: Despite the lack of infiltrate on CXR, the patient's sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas, which suggests a high risk of pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient has a history of hypotension, and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of hypotension.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 101 bpm, which is above the normal range. The patient has a history of tachycardia, and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of tachycardia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and the use of oxygen therapy may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and the Hct has dropped to 22.5. The patient has been transfused with one unit of packed RBCs, and the Hct has increased to 24.8.
7. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: The patient has a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is a complication of HIV/AIDS. The patient's mental status is poor, and the patient is at high risk for further neurological impairment.
8. Code status: The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, which means that the patient does not want to be intubated or receive chest compressions in the event of cardiac arrest.
9. HIV/AIDS: The patient has advanced HIV/AIDS, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections and complications.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren 2.0 (Full) via tube feeding, which may not be sufficient to meet the patient's nutritional needs.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at high risk for sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of indwelling lines. The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be related to the use of metoprolol, and the patient's anemia may be related to the patient's chronic anemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which means that the patient does not want to be intubated or receive chest compressions in the event of cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed sparse growth of pseduomonas, though no evidence of
   infiltrate on CXR
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Further workup for sepsis can be tailored based on CD4 count (53).
   - Consider workup/treatment coverage for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nothing on CXR and
   oxygenation good (and has been on ppx).
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx results
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - Ceftaz for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  Ceftaz
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   - not responsive to  pain today
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct
   -
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a history of HIV with a CD4 count of 53. He is on HAART and atovaquone for prophylaxis. He has a tracheostomy and an indwelling line, unclear for how long.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.2 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 263 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Glucose: 125 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia
* HIV/AIDS
* PML
* Chronic anemia (macrocytic)
* Tachycardia (sinus tachycardia)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa
* Metoprolol titrated down to 37.5 mg TID
* Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Atovaquone for prophylaxis
* HAART
* Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 (Full) with added banana flakes to thicken stool

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis
* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary infiltrates
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
* Chronic anemia
* Hypotension
* Tachycardia
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infectious complications due to indwelling line
* Neurological deterioration due to PML

I recommend close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response. Further workup for sepsis and PML should be considered based on the patient's CD4 count and clinical presentation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
    # PNEUMONIA:
   -          Sputum culture from [**8-7**] grew out pseudomonas, sensitive to
   Zosyn and [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt received 4 days of Vanc/zosyn
   -          Will plan on treating for 14 days total: with 4 days of
   zosyn and started [**Name (NI) **] [**8-11**], will plan on stop date of [**2137-8-20**]
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative in last ~week; follow up third to r/o- also
   negative.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated down
   Metoprolol  to 37.5 mg TID today.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
   # Bacteremia.  Last positive blood culture several weeks ago; was on
   vanco in past but course appears completed.  Has L PICC, unclear how
   old.
   - [**Hospital1 **] for pseudomonas in sputum
   - Afebrile overnight
   - f/u cultures as above
   -          Will keep PICC in for now
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
   # H/o Positive sputum cultures. No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR,
   but with significant immunosuppresion.
   - Sputum showed no microorganisms
   -          hold colistin as not available in inhaled form
   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  [**Hospital1 **]
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - Decrease to 37.5 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART; now on HAART x 4 months.
   - CD4 on recheck
   - Continue HAART.
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   - not responsive to  pain today
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   - Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above, though does not
   appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother yesterday- would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25
   -                Continue to monitor Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed pseudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 100.4°F (38°C)
* Heart rate: 110 bpm (sinus tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 99/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has copious secretions and is at risk for aspiration.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 239 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 116 mg/dL
* Amylase: 23 IU/L
* Lipase: 19 IU/L

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is currently at a skilled nursing facility, where he is receiving antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for his HIV/AIDS.

The patient's current medications include:

* Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for pseudomonas infection
* Vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
* Atovaquone for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
* Nystatin cream for perirectal fungal rash

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's positive blood and sputum cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Aspiration: The patient's tracheostomy and copious secretions put him at risk for aspiration, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of PML and his current respiratory symptoms increase his risk of developing pneumonia, which could be complicated by his underlying immunodeficiency.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen with ongoing bleeding or blood loss, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen with ongoing sepsis or other complications, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening consequences.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling PICC line and tracheostomy increase his risk of developing infections, which could be complicated by his underlying immunodeficiency.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Afebrile overnight, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - started Ceftazidime 2g IV q8h for pseudomonas

   -          New sputum cult  postivive for pseudomonas, started  [**Hospital1 **]
   -          Increased pulmonary secretions as per nursing. On
   scopolamine patch already, added Amitriptyline to decrease secretions
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
   - Cx sputum, blood, stool, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - H/o multiple pulmonary infections with multiple resistance, no other
   clear source

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and PML, admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. He has a history of pneumonia, bacteremia, and chronic anemia. His current conditions include:

* Pneumonia with sputum culture growing Pseudomonas, sensitive to Zosyn and [**Name (NI) **]
* Bacteremia with positive blood cultures
* Hypotension (not in shock) with a baseline blood pressure in the mid-90s
* Fever (hypothermia) with a temperature of 101.6 previously, but afebrile for days
* Tachycardia with a heart rate of 110-115 bpm
* Chronic anemia with a hematocrit of 22.5, which dropped to 24.8 after transfusion of 1 unit packed RBCs
* Poor mental status with progressive neurologic impairment
* History of EtOH abuse, now at a skilled nursing facility with no concern for withdrawal issues

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state, and the presence of Pseudomonas in his sputum culture.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively, leading to shock and organ failure.
5. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
6. Neurologic impairment: The patient's progressive neurologic impairment may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively, leading to decreased cognitive function and increased risk of complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's poor mental status and progressive neurologic impairment may lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output, if not treated promptly and effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. The patient's temperature has been spiking, with a current reading of 103.6°F (39.8°C). He has been treated with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and has been switched to Zosyn due to the absence of fever on this medication.

The patient has a history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which was sensitive to Zosyn. He has also had a positive blood culture and sputum culture, with growth of GNR (gram-negative rod). The patient's PICC line has been cultured, and the results are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. He is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheostomy tube and has a positive fluid balance of 3.3 liters over the past 24 hours.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a current hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL. He has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and is receiving iron supplements. His platelet count is 187,000/mL, and his white blood cell count is 2.5 x 10^9/L.

The patient's HIV status is known, with a current CD4 count of 53. He has been on antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for four months and is also receiving prophylactic medication for opportunistic infections.

The patient's mental status is poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. He has a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and is at high risk for opportunistic infections.

The patient's airway is at risk due to his tracheostomy and copious secretions. He is receiving scopolamine patches to help manage his secretions and is also receiving amitripyline to decrease his secretions.

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to his underlying medical condition and is being managed with metoprolol. His blood pressure is stable, and he is receiving prophylactic medication for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) at the request of his mother.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures suggest that he may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed growth of GNR, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Catheter-associated bloodstream infection: The patient's PICC line has been cultured, and the results are pending.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL, which is below normal. He may require further transfusions or other treatments to manage his anemia.
5. Opportunistic infections: The patient's HIV status and history of PML make him at high risk for opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's poor mental status and history of PML make him at risk for further neurological deterioration.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheostomy and copious secretions make him at risk for respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension make him at risk for cardiovascular instability.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy, admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. He has a history of indwelling PICC line and has been on HAART for 4 months. His current vital signs include a temperature of 103.6°F, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy and oxygen delivery device.

The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, and has been treated with antibiotics, including Zosyn and Vancomycin. His blood cultures are pending, and his sputum cultures have shown Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn.

The patient has also been experiencing anemia, chronic, likely due to HAART, and has been transfused with one unit of packed RBCs. His Hct is currently stable at 24.8%.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with a head CT showing progression of PML with diffuse white matter involvement. He has been experiencing anisocoria, abduction of both eyes, and has a poor mental status.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and his goals of care discussion with his mother indicate that he would not want to be intubated or receive chest compressions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures, along with his fever and hypotension, make him at risk for developing sepsis.
2. PML progression: The patient's head CT shows progression of PML, which can lead to further neurological decline and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen with ongoing HAART therapy, leading to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
4. Infection: The patient's indwelling PICC line and history of indwelling line make him at risk for developing line-related infections.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and poor respiratory status make him at risk for developing respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension make him at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological decline: The patient's poor neurological status and progression of PML make him at risk for further neurological decline, which could lead to decreased quality of life and potentially life-threatening complications."

   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's temperature has spiked to 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and they have developed anisocoria and abduction of both eyes. The patient's head CT scan showed progression of PML with diffuse white matter involvement.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.9, a platelet count of 217, and a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes zosyn, vancomycin, and lopressor, which were started to treat the patient's sepsis and hypotension. The patient was also given a scopolamine patch to help manage their secretions.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with scattered wheezes bilaterally and a decreased lung volume. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and they are receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy.

The patient's neurological status is also compromised, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 and a decreased level of consciousness. The patient's pupillary reactions are abnormal, and they have a decreased response to light.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is also compromised, with a decreased appetite and a decrease in stool output.

The patient's laboratory results show a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes zosyn, vancomycin, and lopressor, which were started to treat the patient's sepsis and hypotension. The patient was also given a scopolamine patch to help manage their secretions.

The patient's prognosis is poor, with a high risk of mortality due to their underlying medical conditions and the progression of their PML. The patient's family has been informed of their condition and has chosen to pursue a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures indicate a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. PML progression: The patient's PML is progressing, which can lead to further neurological decline and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised respiratory status can lead to respiratory failure and death if not managed promptly.
5. Gastrointestinal failure: The patient's compromised gastrointestinal status can lead to gastrointestinal failure and death if not managed promptly.
6. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia can worsen if not managed promptly, which can lead to organ failure and death.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance can worsen if not managed promptly, which can lead to organ failure and death.
8. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system makes them susceptible to infections, which can lead to organ failure and death.

In summary, this patient is at high risk of mortality due to their underlying medical conditions and the progression of their PML. The patient's family has chosen to pursue a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, and the patient's prognosis is poor."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed pseudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed pseudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 yesterday from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8.
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient's temperature has been spiking, with a maximum of 103.6°C (rectally) and diaphoretic despite being cool to touch.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s-90s mmHg, with a drop to 70s mmHg after receiving lopressor. He has been given 3X 500mL NS and an additional 50mL to improve blood pressure.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via tracheal mask, with an SpO2 of 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is 113-136 beats per minute, and his rhythm is sinus tachycardia.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is poor, and he is not responding to stimuli.
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 4.3-5.9 x 10^9/L
	+ Hct: 24.8-28.9%
	+ Platelet count: 187-239 x 10^9/L
	+ Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
	+ LDH: 233 IU/L
	+ Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as increased secretions and hypoxia, may indicate pneumonia.
3. ARDS: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on CXR may suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocarditis or cardiomyopathy.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's poor mental status and progressive neurologic impairment may worsen, leading to increased risk of aspiration, respiratory failure, and death.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Antibiotic therapy: The patient is receiving antibiotics, including Zosyn and Vancomycin, to cover for MRSA and pseudomonas.
2. Fluid management: The patient is receiving IV fluids to improve blood pressure and prevent dehydration.
3. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via tracheal mask and is being monitored for signs of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular management: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are being closely monitored, and he is receiving medication to manage his tachycardia and hypotension.
5. Neurological management: The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving medication to manage his secretions and prevent aspiration.
6. Anemia management: The patient's anemia is being managed with packed RBC transfusions and continued monitoring of his Hct.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, indicating that he would not want to be intubated or receive chest compressions in the event of cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient has been experiencing a fever, with a temperature spike to 103.6°C, and is diaphoretic despite being cool to the touch. The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, with systolic blood pressures in the 80s-90s and heart rates in the 130s.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 187 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 63 IU/L and an AST of 61 IU/L.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. The patient's nutritional support consists of a full-elemental diet via a nasogastric tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia are indicative of a potential septic episode.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, including the brain, kidneys, and liver.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and coagulopathy can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or failure.
8. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis can indicate a potential infection, which can spread to other parts of the body.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that the patient does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest. The patient's disposition is unknown, but it is likely that the patient will require ongoing intensive care and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Add vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and a tracheostomy. He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient has a history of fever, with a temperature spike to 102.6 rectally and diaphoresis, although he is cool to touch. He has been experiencing increased eosinophilia, and his blood cultures have grown GNR (Gram-Negative Rod). His sputum cultures have also shown Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn. He has been treated with Vancomycin, but his fever persists, and he has been switched back to Zosyn for the remainder of his 14-day course.

The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, with a blood pressure of 80s-90s mmHg, and has been treated with IV fluids and vasopressors. His fluid balance is positive 3.3L over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, and his ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results show a pH of 7.25, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PaO2 of 102 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 187 K/uL. His liver function tests show elevated levels of ALT and AST, and his kidney function tests show elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen.

The patient's medical history includes a history of ethanol abuse and HIV/AIDS, with a CD4 count of 53. He has been on HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for 4 months and has been experiencing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

The patient's physical examination shows a temperature of 103.6 rectally, a blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg, and a heart rate of 113 beats per minute. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0, glycemic control with insulin, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer with heparin and famotidine, respectively.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures, as well as his fever and hypotension, suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient's sputum cultures have shown Pseudomonas, which can cause pneumonia.
3. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV/AIDS diagnosis increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections and other complications.
4. PML progression: The patient's PML diagnosis increases his risk of developing neurological complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not treated promptly.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air, which may indicate respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and a tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. His fever spiked to 102.8°F, and he has been receiving antibiotics, including Zosyn, Ceftazidime, and Vancomycin. He has a history of indwelling PICC line, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, likely due to his underlying condition, and his blood pressure has been fluctuating. He has been receiving antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for his HIV, and his CD4 count has improved from 17 to 53.

The patient's neurologic status is poor, and he has been experiencing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He has a history of ethanol abuse and is now at a skilled nursing facility, where he is being monitored for withdrawal symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's positive sputum cultures and fever suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Meningitis: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever suggest the possibility of meningitis, which could lead to neurological impairment and death.
4. PML progression: The patient's PML is likely to progress, which could lead to further neurological impairment and death.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of indwelling PICC line and his current antibiotic therapy could lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation.
6. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure could lead to hypotension, which could compromise his organ function and increase his risk of sepsis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia could lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
8. Infection control: The patient's indwelling PICC line and his current antibiotic therapy could lead to infection control issues, such as line sepsis or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy as directed.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory status closely.
3. Consider imaging studies, such as a head CT or MRI, to rule out other causes of fever and neurological impairment.
4. Monitor the patient's neurologic status closely, and consider adjusting his antiretroviral therapy if necessary.
5. Consider adjusting his anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely, and consider adjusting his antibiotic therapy if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to optimize the patient's antibiotic therapy and monitor for infection control issues.
8. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care and monitor for respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
 .H/O FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   - Temp to 101 on [**8-12**], had previously, been afebrile for days
   - Repeat Cx sputum, blood, urine results as above, follow up other cx
   - Sputum from [**8-2**] showed Peudomonas, sensitive to [**Month/Day (4) **] and Zosyn.
   Given new fever on [**Month/Day (4) **] and absence of fever on zosyn, will switch
   back to Zosyn for remainder of course. Pt received 4 days of
   Vanc/zosyn, then 2 days of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue zosyn through [**8-20**] for
   14 day course
   - No other clear source of infection on exam or cx
   - Added vancomycin to cover for MRSA given history of indwelling PICC (
   PICC site shows no evidence of infection, blood cx drawn off PICC line,
   will keep in for now).
   - Acetaminophen as needed for fever
   - pt has atypical lymphocytes on smear today. Will order CMV and EBV
   VLs
   - pt has pyuria O/N
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Per [**Hospital1 630**] his baseline bp appears to be mid 90s, had one BP of 84/52
   on [**8-2**] but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN supervisor appears to have been in the 90s since.
   Believes sent in more for low grade temps (up to 100.8 off and on); in
   ED had SBP 90 and has been in the 90's to 100's since.  Has advanced
   HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore
   may be at high risk for infection.  Also with indwelling line x unclear
   time period.
   - Febrile [**8-12**] as above, continue to monitor
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - Sputum showed pseudomonas as above
   - back on Zosyn for pseudomonas
   - Urine showed no growth
   - 2 c.diffs negative this stay.
   - Keep PICC for now, will readdress following cx result
   - Per outside hospital records, had been on 25 Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]; the 100
   mg QID listed by [**Hospital1 630**] is a large increase.  Titrated up Metoprolol
   to 50 mg TID today.  Will keep dosing intermediate and monitor.
   - Follow CXR and clinical signs
 .H/O AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   - Pt s/p trach, copious secretion, and baseline colonization.
   -Will decrease scopolamine, as may contribute to fever
   - added amitripyline to decrease secretions, will titrate up to effect
   reached.
   - CXR has been stable, no need to monitor daily

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   Sinus.  Likely long standing (though unclear etiology) given [**Name (NI) 169**] dosing
   of 400 mg metoprolol daily.
   - 50 mg Metoprolol TID reduced to 35.5mg
   - Monitor for hypotension
   - HR continues to be 90-115

 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   Last CD4 count 17 was prior to HAART, now 53.  Has been on HAART x 4
   months.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue atovaquone for prophylaxis.
   - Added nystatin crm for perirectal fungal rash
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
   Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per
   [**Hospital1 630**] reports.  Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
   Intially considered.  Consider head CT/LP for workup of fever as above,
   though does not appear that mental status worsening- will hold off for
   now.
   - Goals of care discussion with mother, she would not want him
   intubated, would not want chest compressions- code status changed to
   DNR/DNI.

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Macrocytic likely [**2-2**] HAART.  No change in last week.   Pt had Hct drop
   to 22.5 on [**2137-8-7**] from 28.5 on admission.  Pt transfused 1 unit packed
   RBCs, Hct up to 24.8 and stable since
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Hct 24-25, continue to monitor Hct
   # History of EtOH abuse.  Now at skilled nursing, no concern for
   withdrawal issues.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.

The patient's fever has been persistent, with a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C) overnight. He has also experienced sinus tachycardia, which is likely long-standing given his previous dosing of metoprolol. His blood pressure has been labile, with a reading of 77/44 mmHg (51) at one point.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.3 K/uL, a hematocrit of 24.8%, and a platelet count of 187. His electrolyte levels are slightly elevated, with a sodium level of 147 mg/dL and a potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of atypical lymphocytes on smear and pyuria, and his urine culture showed no growth. His sputum culture showed Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Zosyn. He has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for his infection.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask. His lung examination is clear, and his chest x-ray is stable.

The patient's neurologic status is poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. He has a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a complication of HIV/AIDS. His mental status has not changed significantly, and his neurologic impairment is progressive.

The patient's anemia is chronic and macrocytic, likely due to his HAART therapy. He has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and has a stable hemoglobin level.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and his family has been informed of this decision.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and positive blood cultures suggest that he may be at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent fever and cough suggest that he may be at risk for developing pneumonia.
3. PML progression: The patient's poor neurologic status and history of PML suggest that his condition may continue to deteriorate.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen, requiring further transfusions.
5. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure may lead to hypotension, which could worsen his condition.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's poor lung function and history of PML suggest that he may be at risk for developing respiratory failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures.
   #. Fevers: Continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely a colonization. Will d/c
   antibiotics as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable. Will follow up viral cultures including CMV VL.
   #. Hypotension: Have decreased the beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Family aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with details. Will approach family about a post-mortem to
   eval PML.
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well. Amytriptiline to reduce secretions. Will decrease scopolamine
   patch as able as may be contributing to fevers.
   #. Sinus Tachycardia in setting of hypotension likely hypovolemia plus
   sepsis. On Metoprolol QID with dose decreased yesterday and HR a little
   bit better today.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be
   concerned about withdrawal.
   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line [**2137-8-6**]
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   #. Dispo: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care. Family
   want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and narcotics. Will
   give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and PML, is admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. Despite antibiotics, the patient continues to experience fevers, which are suspected to be due to a central process rather than an infectious cause. The patient's hypotension is managed with fluids and decreased beta blocker dosage. The patient's HIV/AIDS is being managed with HAART and PPX. The prognosis for PML is poor, and the family has been informed of the situation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) complications: Given the patient's diagnosis of PML, there is a high risk of CNS complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cerebral edema.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheostomy and sinus tachycardia may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's airway is not properly managed.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as inflammatory bowel disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures may indicate a serious infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
7. HIV/AIDS complications: The patient's end-stage HIV/AIDS may lead to complications such as opportunistic infections, wasting syndrome, or neurological disorders.
8. PML complications: The patient's PML may lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cerebral edema.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any signs of deterioration and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and positive blood and sputum cultures. Despite antibiotics, the patient continues to spike fevers, and the medical team suspects a central process rather than an infectious cause. The patient's airway is compromised, and they are currently on a tracheostomy mask with amytriptiline to reduce secretions. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, but none since admission.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm (sinus tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 104/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.1-5.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.3-28.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 193-234 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113-147 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 233 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol (decreased dose)
* Heparin (prophylaxis)
* Famotidine (stress ulcer prophylaxis)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (antibiotic)
* Ceftazidime (antibiotic)
* Vancomycin (antibiotic)
* Morphine (pain medication)

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's continued fevers and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
* Pneumonia: The patient's tracheostomy and positive blood and sputum cultures increase the risk of pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and current use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's PML and HIV/AIDS increase the risk of neurological deterioration, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised airway and respiratory rate increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML, was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever. Despite antibiotics, the patient continues to spike fevers, and cultures have not yielded any positive results except for a likely colonization in the PSA in sputum. The patient's hypotension has been managed by decreasing the beta blocker, and fluids will be given as necessary. The patient's HIV/AIDS is being managed with HAART and PPX. The patient's PML prognosis and quality of life are poor, and the family is aware of the extent of management they want to continue.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's continued fevers and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's sinus tachycardia in the setting of hypotension likely indicates hypovolemia, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
3. PML progression: The patient's PML is likely to continue to progress, which can lead to further decline in his condition and quality of life.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's tracheostomy and need for oxygen therapy suggest the possibility of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and need for nutritional support suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, such as malnutrition or dehydration.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's PML and HIV/AIDS increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
8. Infection control: The patient's colonization with PSA in sputum suggests the possibility of infection control issues, such as transmission of infection to healthcare workers or other patients."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever.

The patient's fever persists despite antibiotics, and there is suspicion of a central process rather than an infectious cause. The antibiotics were discontinued as per ID recommendations, and re-initiation is planned if the patient becomes unstable.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm
* Blood pressure: 104/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 470 cells/μL (down from 810)
* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 193 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 233 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: NAD, supine in bed
* HEENT: Eyes open, gaze dysconjugate, mucous membranes moist, tracheostomy in place with copious secretions
* Cardiovascular: Distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, tachycardia
* Pulmonary: Coarse breath sounds
* Abdominal: Bowel sounds present, no tenderness
* Extremities: No edema
* Skin: Warm and dry

The patient's medical history includes:

* HIV/AIDS
* PML
* Tracheostomy
* End-stage HIV/AIDS
* Hypotension
* Fever
* Abdominal pain
* Allergies to dapsone and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim

The patient's plan includes:

* Discontinuation of antibiotics
* Re-initiation of antibiotics if the patient becomes unstable
* Fluid management
* Nutrition with Nutren 2.0 and Beneprotein
* Glycemic control
* PICC line management
* DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine
* Code status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis
* Organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, renal)
* Anemia
* Infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection)
* Abdominal compartment syndrome
* PML progression
* HIV/AIDS progression

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and fever.
   #. Fevers: Continued to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely colonization.  Antibiotics
   d/c
d [**8-15**] as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable. Now afebrile on tylenol
   -          CMV Ab not detected
   -          C. diff negative [**8-15**]
   -          EBV PCR pending
   -          ANC down to 470, t hough WBC count increased
   -          Tylenol 650 mg q 6hrs
   -          Cx for temp spikes if no cx in previous 48 hrs
   #. Hypotension: Have discontinued beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well.
   -          Increase Amytriptiline to reduce secretions.
   -          Continue scopolamine patch
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia:  Pt has been off Metoprolol for several days, and
   HR remains in 110s.  This may be due to developing anemia, see below.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 21.7 from 24 yesterday, without a clear source or
   cause.
   -          Recheck PM Hct
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Transfuse 1 unit if Hct < 21
   -          Consider further evaluation of abdominal pain if continued
   decrease in Hct
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Mother  aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] with details. Will approach family about a
   post-mortem to eval PML.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be
   concerned about withdrawal.
   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line present at admission.
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care.
   Family want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and
   narcotics. Will give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.
   # Communication: Mother [**Name (NI) 249**] is HCP; number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3958**]
   .
   # Dispo: to floor
   .
   #DNR/DNI ICU while inpatient, nursing needs currently exceed floor
   capacity.   Can discuss transfer to floor next week or possible return
   to rehab if patient remains afebrile.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 84 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Over the past 24 hours, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells, which increased their hemoglobin level from 21 to 26. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 129 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/64 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheal mask and ABG results show a pH of 7.30.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, as well as elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, and their liver function tests are mildly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to dapsone and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, as well as a history of chronic anemia. They have a code status of DNR/DNI and are currently receiving nutrition through a PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status may increase their risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen their condition.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and recent blood transfusion may increase their risk of hemorrhage.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate underlying kidney damage, which could worsen their condition.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and recent blood transfusion may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate levels and tachycardia may indicate underlying sepsis, which could worsen their condition.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status may increase their risk of cardiovascular instability.

Based on this information, it is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly. Further evaluation and management of the patient's underlying conditions, such as anemia and potential infections, are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve their outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever. He has a tracheostomy in place and is currently on antibiotics, but they have been discontinued due to suspicion of a central process rather than infectious etiology. The patient's white blood cell count has increased, but his hemoglobin level has decreased from 24 to 21.7. He has a history of anemia, and his platelet count is low. The patient is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, which may be related to developing anemia. He has a poor prognosis and quality of life, and his family is aware of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased significantly, which may lead to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
2. PML: The patient's prognosis and quality of life are poor, and the disease is likely to progress and cause further complications.
3. Infections: Despite the discontinuation of antibiotics, the patient may still be at risk for infections, particularly central nervous system infections, given his compromised immune system.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be exacerbated by his anemia and low platelet count, which could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheostomy and sinus tachycardia may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if he develops further complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's PML may continue to progress and cause further neurological deterioration, which could lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and platelet count to assess the effectiveness of treatment and to identify any potential complications.
2. Consider transfusing the patient with packed red blood cells or platelets if his hemoglobin level falls below 21 or his platelet count falls below 20,000.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including antibiotics, antipyretics, and narcotics, as needed.
4. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further evaluate the patient's PML and to develop a plan for managing his condition.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, as needed.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a rehabilitation facility if he remains afebrile and his condition stabilizes."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and fever.
   #. Fevers: Continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely colonization.  Antibiotics
   d/c
d [**8-15**] as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable.
   -          CMV Ab not detected
   -          C. diff negative [**8-15**]
   -          EBV PCR pending
   -          ANC down to 470, t hough WBC count increased
   -          Tylenol 650 mg q 6hrs
   -          Cx for temp spikes if no cx in previous 48 hrs
   #. Hypotension: Have discontinued beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well.
   -          Increase Amytriptiline to reduce secretions.
   -          Continue scopolamine patch
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia:  Pt has been off Metoprolol for several days, and
   HR remains in 110s.  This may be due to developing anemia, see below.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 21.7 from 24 yesterday, without a clear source or
   cause.
   -          Recheck PM Hct
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Transfuse 1 unit if Hct < 21
   -          Consider further evaluation of abdominal pain if continued
   decrease in Hct
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Mother  aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] with details. Will approach family about a
   post-mortem to eval PML.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be
   concerned about withdrawal.
   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line present at admission.
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care.
   Family want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and
   narcotics. Will give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.
   # Communication: Mother [**Name (NI) 249**] is HCP; number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3958**]
   .
   # Dispo: DNR/DNI ICU while inpatient, nursing needs currently exceed
   floor capacity.   Can discuss transfer to floor next week or possible
   return to rehab if patient remains afebrile.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   36 M with end stage HIV/AIDS, known PML, with trach in [**Hospital1 169**]; now admit
   with hypotension and fever.
   #. Fevers: Continues to spike fevers despite antibiotics and suspicion
   of a central process rather than infectious. No cultures positive
   except the PSA in sputum which is likely colonization.  Antibiotics
   d/c
d [**8-15**] as per ID recs. Will re-initiate if patient becomes
   unstable.
   -          CMV Ab not detected
   -          C. diff negative [**8-15**]
   -          EBV PCR pending
   -          ANC down to 470, t hough WBC count increased
   -          Tylenol 650 mg q 6hrs
   -          Cx for temp spikes if no cx in previous 48 hrs
   #. Hypotension: Have discontinued beta blocker. Will give fluids as
   necessary.
   #. HIV/AIDS: Continuing HAART and PPX
   #. Inability to protect airway now s/p trach. On trach mask satting
   well.
   -          Increase Amytriptiline to reduce secretions.
   -          Continue scopolamine patch
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia:  Pt has been off Metoprolol for several days, and
   HR remains in 110s.  This may be due to developing anemia, see below.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 21.7 from 24 yesterday, without a clear source or
   cause.
   -          Recheck PM Hct
   -          Guiac stools
   -          Transfuse 1 unit if Hct < 21
   -          Consider further evaluation of abdominal pain if continued
   decrease in Hct
   #. PML: Prognosis and quality of life quite poor now. Mother  aware and
   still working out extent of management they want to continue. Spoke
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] who had seen the patient before but never actually
   been his primary neurologist. Will formally consult with neuro if we
   feel it will change our management but for now will hold off. Will
   update Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4304**] with details. Will approach family about a
   post-mortem to eval PML.
   #. H/O EtOH abuse: None since has been at [**Hospital1 630**] and no reason to be
   concerned about withdrawal.
   #. ICU CARE:
   - Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 with 50mg Beneprotein at 40mL/hour with banana
   flakes to thicken stool
   - Glycemic control: BGs WNL
   - Lines: PICC Line present at admission.
   #. PPX:
   - DVT: SC Heparin
   - Stress ulcer: Famotidine
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI with no pressors and no escalation of care.
   Family want antibiotics, fluids, nutrition, anti-pyretics, and
   narcotics. Will give morphine if patient appears uncomfortable.
   # Communication: Mother [**Name (NI) 249**] is HCP; number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3958**]
   .
   # Dispo: DNR/DNI ICU while inpatient, nursing needs currently exceed
   floor capacity.   Can discuss transfer to floor next week or possible
   return to rehab if patient remains afebrile.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 36-year-old male with end-stage HIV/AIDS and known PML, admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever.
* He has a tracheostomy (trach) in place and is on a tracheal mask with a SpO2 of 100%.
* His hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 110/64 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute.
* He has a total fluid balance of 1,959 mL, with 959 mL administered and 1,340 mL output.

**Lab Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 3.4 K/uL, Hct 26.3%, Platelet count 15 K/uL.
* Blood chemistry: Creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, Glucose 113 mg/dL, Albumin 2.9 g/dL, LDH 233 IU/L, Ca++ 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 3.2 mg/dL.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's fevers have not resolved despite antibiotics, and there is suspicion of a central process.
* Antibiotics have been discontinued, and the patient will be re-initiated if he becomes unstable.
* The patient has hypotension, which has been managed by discontinuing beta blockers and administering fluids as necessary.
* The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 21.7 g/dL, which is decreasing without a clear source or cause.
* The patient has PML, with a poor prognosis and quality of life.
* The patient's family is aware and is still working out the extent of management they want to continue.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Central nervous system infection:** The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate a central nervous system infection, which could worsen his condition.
2. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be worsening, which could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
3. **PML progression:** The patient's PML may continue to progress, leading to further decline in his condition and quality of life.
4. **Sepsis:** The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
5. **Gastrointestinal bleeding:** The patient's anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
6. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's tracheostomy and respiratory support may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
7. **Cardiovascular instability:** The patient's hypotension and anemia may lead to cardiovascular instability, which could worsen his condition.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Re-initiate antibiotics if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of a central process.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's anemia, including gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes.
4. Continue to manage the patient's PML and HIV/AIDS, including antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider increasing oxygen support or mechanical ventilation if necessary.
6. Consider consulting with neurology and infectious disease specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.
7. Discuss the patient's code status and management plan with the family and healthcare providers."
