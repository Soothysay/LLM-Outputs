   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Pt is a 55 y/o female w/ hx of DMII, CAD, HTN, and CHF (EF 55%) who
   presented w/ hyperglycemia.
   #Hyperglycemia: Patient w/ long history of diabets, followed by her PCP
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1324**]. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3, new one pending.  Current
   hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid injection in ortho clinic. Pt
   developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. No ketones in urine, and an AG
   of 15. AG closed w/ fluids.  Insulin gtt d/c'd yesterday, still w/
   persistently high BS.  SS increased, and sugars appear to b e moving in
   the correct direction.
   -- continue increased SS and fixed dose
   -- f/u pending HbgA1C
   # CAD: Patient w/ evidence of prior IMI and possible anterior MI on
   EKG. No current complaints of CP. EKG w/o any acute changes. Continue
   patients statin. Unclear why not on ASA, as is a DM w/ CAD. Also,
   patient not on BB, but suspect is related to hx of asthma.
   # HTN: Patient w/ hx of HTN. Hypertensive on this admission. Continue
   outpatinet regiment of verapimil and lisinopril. BP still elevated, LVH
   on EKG
   -- increased lisinopril dose
   # Diastolic HF: Patient [**Name (NI) **] in [**2193**] showed EF > 55% with symmetric LV
   hypterophy.  Unclear why patinet is not on BB. Will continue patients
   lasix 80mg daily and lisinopril.
   #Psych: Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1325**] as an outpatinet. Will continue OP
   regiment of wellbutrin, seroquel, and effexor.
   #PE: Patinet w/ hx of PE x 2. Takes coumadin at a stable dose of 7mg
   daily. INR on admission was 4.6, will hold coumadin, and restart when
   no nolonger supratherapeutic.
   #CRI: Per chart, patinet w/ hx of CRI, but baseline Cr of 1.0. Believed
   diabetic/htn nephropathy w/ protinuria. Cr on admission is 1.5. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   elevated from diuresis from hyper glycemia. Also, patient taking
   gabapentin as renally toxic levels. Will continue IVF hydration and see
   if resolves.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to hyperglycemia, with blood glucose levels persistently in the high 300s. Despite discontinuation of insulin infusion and titration of sliding scale insulin, her blood sugar levels remained elevated. The patient's other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease, asthma, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing on auscultation of the chest, and her extremities are absent on the right and left sides. Her neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Her blood glucose level is currently 301 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's persistent hyperglycemia can lead to a hyperglycemic crisis, which can cause severe dehydration, ketoacidosis, and even coma.
2. Diabetic nephropathy: The patient's chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's asthma and history of pulmonary embolism increase her risk of pulmonary complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's unassessed neurological examination and history of pulmonary embolism increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.

Given the patient's complex medical conditions, it is essential to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels, electrolyte levels, and renal function. The patient's medications should be adjusted as needed to manage her hyperglycemia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Additionally, the patient's asthma and pulmonary embolism history should be closely monitored, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Pt is a 55 y/o female w/ hx of DMII, CAD, HTN, and CHF (EF 55%) who
   presented w/ hyperglycemia.
   #Hyperglycemia: Patient w/ long history of diabets, followed by her PCP
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1324**]. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3, new one pending.  Current
   hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid injection in ortho clinic. Pt
   developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. No ketones in urine, and an AG
   of 15. AG closed w/ fluids.  Insulin gtt d/c'd yesterday, still w/
   persistently high BS.  SS increased, and sugars appear to b e moving in
   the correct direction.
   -- continue increased SS and fixed dose
   -- f/u pending HbgA1C
   # CAD: Patient w/ evidence of prior IMI and possible anterior MI on
   EKG. No current complaints of CP. EKG w/o any acute changes. Continue
   patients statin. Unclear why not on ASA, as is a DM w/ CAD. Also,
   patient not on BB, but suspect is related to hx of asthma.
   # HTN: Patient w/ hx of HTN. Hypertensive on this admission. Continue
   outpatinet regiment of verapimil and lisinopril. BP still elevated, LVH
   on EKG
   -- increased lisinopril dose
   # Diastolic HF: Patient [**Name (NI) **] in [**2193**] showed EF > 55% with symmetric LV
   hypterophy.  Unclear why patinet is not on BB. Will continue patients
   lasix 80mg daily and lisinopril.
   #Psych: Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1325**] as an outpatinet. Will continue OP
   regiment of wellbutrin, seroquel, and effexor.
   #PE: Patinet w/ hx of PE x 2. Takes coumadin at a stable dose of 7mg
   daily. INR on admission was 4.6, will hold coumadin, and restart when
   no nolonger supratherapeutic.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure (EF 55%). She presented with hyperglycemia and was treated with insulin sliding scale and NPH dose adjustments. Despite these efforts, her blood sugars remained elevated in the high 300s. The patient's blood pressure persisted in the 160s, prompting an increase in lisinopril dose.

The patient's medical history includes a previous diagnosis of asthma, and she was wheezing on examination. She was started on albuterol nebs. The patient's cardiac history includes a prior inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and possible anterior MI on EKG, but she does not have current complaints of chest pain.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.3), platelet count (242), and creatinine (1.2 mg/dL). Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. Her coagulation profile shows an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.1, which is supratherapeutic.

The patient's physical examination revealed wheezing on lung examination, and she was noted to have a sinus bradycardia. Her extremities were absent on both sides, and her skin was not assessed.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to persistent hyperglycemia.
2. Hyperkalemia due to increased potassium levels.
3. Hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled blood pressure.
4. Respiratory failure due to worsening asthma.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias due to sinus bradycardia and supratherapeutic INR.
6. Renal failure due to worsening kidney function.
7. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and compromised immune system.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's blood sugars, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels to prevent these potential complications. Further adjustments to her insulin regimen, blood pressure medications, and asthma treatment may be necessary to optimize her care."

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and hypertension who presented with hyperglycemia and anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain. She has been treated with insulin drip and transitioned to NPH and Humalog with sliding scale insulin (SSI) but still has suboptimal control. The patient reports having similar acute hyperglycemia in the past with steroid injections and oral steroids, and has no infectious signs or symptoms to suggest an additional etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels remain elevated, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or even cerebral edema.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and diastolic heart failure puts her at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's mild creatinine elevation on admission, likely due to pre-renal azotemia from hyperglycemia, requires close monitoring to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's supratherapeutic INR requires close monitoring to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, likely due to steroids, requires close monitoring for signs of infection, and a clean urine culture to rule out urinary tract infection.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires close monitoring and adjustment of home medications to prevent complications.
7. Sleep Disturbances: The patient's reported sleep disturbances at night may require an outpatient sleep evaluation to address potential risks with diabetes and heart failure.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her medical conditions and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F w/  DMII, cad, htn, diastolic chf presents with
   hyperglycemia/anion gap (honk) following steroid injection for chronic
   knee pain.
   Improved control obtained with insulin drip and transitioned from drip
   to NPH and humalog with SSI though still with suboptimal control,
   likely related to diet and recent steroids.  She has no infectious
   signs or symptoms to suggest additional etiology Adjusting nph and
   sliding scale doses.  Consider [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult as pt is not followed by
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] as outpt but may benefit, given elevated Hb a1C.   Pt reports
   having similar acute hyperglycemia in past with steroid injections as
   well as oral steroids (for asthma).
   Additional issues include:
        -CRI--noted to have mild creatinine elevation on admit, in setting
   of hyperglycemia, now at baseline after IVFs.  Monitor with increased
   ace-i dose
        -Supratherapeutic INR.  Coumadin held and now 2.1,  Restarting at
   home dose--continue to monitor given high level on admit.
        -Leukocytosis-likely from steroids and now normalizing, cx if
   spikes, u/a clean and knee without evidence of infection.
        -HTN/ddfx--adjusting home meds for improved control-- increasing
   lisinopril dose today
        ? OSA--would benefit from outpt sleep evaluation, and has multiple
   risks for sleep disordered breathing with dm and chf

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and hypertension who presented with hyperglycemia and anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain. She has been receiving insulin drip and transitioned to NPH and Humalog with sliding scale insulin (SSI) to improve glycemic control. Although she has achieved some improvement, her blood sugar levels remain suboptimal, likely related to her diet and recent steroid use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 158/71 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with a well-nourished appearance, normal cervical lymph nodes, and no signs of respiratory distress. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show mild creatinine elevation on admission, which has resolved after IV fluids. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic, and Coumadin has been held, with plans to restart at home dose. Leukocytosis is likely related to steroids, and her white blood cell count is normalizing. Her hemoglobin A1C is elevated, and she may benefit from a consult with a specialist.

The patient's medications include insulin, lisinopril, and H2 blockers, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
2. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression from steroids and diabetes.
3. Worsening of diastolic heart failure, leading to cardiac complications.
4. Development of sleep-disordered breathing, particularly obstructive sleep apnea, due to her underlying conditions.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR.
6. Development of chronic kidney disease or worsening of existing kidney disease due to diabetes and hypertension.
7. Increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction or stroke, due to hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.

Based on this information, I recommend close monitoring of the patient's glycemic control, blood pressure, and cardiac status, as well as regular assessments for signs of infection, bleeding, or sleep-disordered breathing."
