   Imaging: [**11-5**] ECHO: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Biventricular dilatation and
   global hypokinesis without significant valvular abnormality.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin, continue for now, pending cultures
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. Now off levophed. Can
   discontinue levophed.
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using Arctic Sun cooling system 24
   hours in the setting of PEA arrest, has been at goal temp now. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - will start warming today.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known
   leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands. possible sources are lungs with
   aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, Clindamycin, and
   Zosyn, azithromycin
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he
   wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, femoral aline
   - attempt resiting aline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin, continue for now, pending cultures
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. Now off levophed. Can
   discontinue levophed.
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using Arctic Sun cooling system 24
   hours in the setting of PEA arrest, has been at goal temp now. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down after overdosing on several drugs, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation following a PEA arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoracies, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 70% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating rhabdomyolysis and muscle damage. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral pneumothoracies and effusions, as well as mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory depression and acidemia are likely causing respiratory failure.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK and LDH levels indicate muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate kidney damage and failure.
4. Bilateral pneumothoracies: The patient's imaging studies show bilateral pneumothoracies and effusions, which may be causing respiratory distress.
5. Shock: The patient's PEA arrest and hypotension may indicate cardiogenic shock.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage and transaminitis.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and muscle damage may increase the risk of compartment syndrome.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia may increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Necrotizing fasciitis: The patient's soft tissue damage and bacteremia may increase the risk of necrotizing fasciitis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiogenic shock and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pneumothoracies and effusions may increase the risk of respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function.
2. Dialysis: The patient is receiving dialysis to treat his acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.
3. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat his bacteremia and pneumonia.
4. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management medications to control his pain.
5. Cardiac monitoring: The patient is receiving cardiac monitoring to monitor his cardiac function and detect any potential arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage his medical complications and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic
   - b/l chest tubes to sunction, IP now following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram - rods
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis: CK on admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine
   4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis. Also possible is necrotizing faceitis in setting of
   trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent lytes.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, prssures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Acute renal failure: with resultant hyperkalemia with peaked t waves.
   Likely etiology is rhabdomyolysis. Also contributing is prerenal
   failure from dehydration during drug use and possible emesis. Post
   renal also possible, but patient has foley now, and no hydro in CT. He
   recieved 2mg CaCl in the ED, as well is 10U IV insulin with an amp of
   D50. His femoral cordis was changed to a HD line over a wire in the ED
   prior to coming up to the MICU.
   - REnal consult called for emergent dialysis in setting of severe
   hyperkalemia.
   - Fluids with bicarb for treatment of rhabdomyolysis.
   - starting emergent dialysis on admission
   - recheck potassium
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. previously on levophed and
   dopamine, the latter of which was weaned off prior to coming to the
   floor. Lactate >9 at max, now trending down
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - monitor CVP goal [**9-9**]
   - generous fluids
   - goal UO >30.
   - check mixed venous sat concurrently with ABG for estimation of
   Cardiac output.
   - consider using vigileo to assess volume status and CO
   - treat emirically broad spectrum for possible infection with vanco,
   cefepime and clindamycin.
   - follow lactate.
   - check concurrent VBG and ABG
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using arctic cooling system for
   12-24 hours in the setting of PEA arrest. will paralyze with vecuronium
   to prevent shivering since patient has rhabdomyolysis.
   - ECHO
   Transaminitis: possibly shock liver in the setting of hypotension,
   acute hep b/c given patient is known drug user, or other [**Last Name (un) **] toxic
   ingestion (negative other than opiods, benzo and cocaine). patient has
   anion gap, but no osmolar gap. Also coagulopathy
   - hep panel
   - f/u liver on CT scan
   Anion gap metabolic acidosis: possible etiologies include lactic
   acidosis, rhabdo, may be DKA. will treat possible sources

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unresponsive after overdosing on multiple drugs, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and PEA arrest. The patient has bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions, likely secondary to aspiration or respiratory depression.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications, including:

1. ARDS net ventilation: The patient is on ARDS net ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has severe rhabdomyolysis with a CK level of 206,000, which may lead to further muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.5, which may lead to further electrolyte disturbances and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has severe hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 7s, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying medical condition and potential sources of infection, including necrotizing fasciitis and pneumonia.
6. Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock with a lactate level of >9, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis with elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to shock liver, acute hepatitis, or other toxic ingestions.
8. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may be secondary to lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, or DKA.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's severe hyperkalemia and cardiogenic shock increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory compromise and potential sources of infection increase his risk of developing further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and potential sources of infection increase his risk of developing further renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Sepsis: The patient's high risk of developing sepsis increases his risk of developing further organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiogenic shock and potential sources of infection increase his risk of developing further cardiac arrest, including pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any potential complications early.
2. Consider further imaging studies, including a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, to evaluate the patient's underlying medical condition and potential sources of infection.
3. Consider consulting with an intensivist and other specialists, such as a nephrologist and a cardiologist, to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.
4. Consider initiating further therapy, including antibiotics and antifungals, to treat potential sources of infection.
5. Consider continuing to support the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular function with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, as necessary.
6. Consider initiating further therapy, including insulin and bicarbonate, to treat the patient's hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
7. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a comprehensive nutrition plan to support the patient's recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.

   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin

   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down after overdosing on multiple drugs, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation. He was intubated after a PEA arrest, which was likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidemia. The patient has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions. He also has a positive Gram stain for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods in his sputum.

The patient is being treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure with ARDS net protocol ventilation, bilateral chest tubes, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. He is also being treated for rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure with dialysis, and for leukocytosis with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has a history of Hepatitis C and is being treated with NAC for repleating glutathione stores.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require continued ventilatory support to manage his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated, and he may require continued dialysis to manage his rhabdomyolysis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require continued dialysis to manage his acute renal failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he may require continued empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage his leukocytosis.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, and he may require continued treatment with NAC to manage his liver function.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient has a history of trauma and may be at risk for compartment syndrome, which could lead to permanent nerve damage or death.
7. Seizure activity: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to seizure activity, which could be life-threatening.
8. Infection: The patient's positive Gram stain for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods in his sputum may indicate a bacterial infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilatory support as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure with dialysis.
3. Continue to treat the patient's leukocytosis with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Continue to treat the patient's Hepatitis C with NAC.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of compartment syndrome and take prompt action if it develops.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of seizure activity and take prompt action if it develops.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and take prompt action if it develops."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic ----
   Fio2 down to 50 %
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin, continue for now, pending cultures
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. Now off levophed. Can
   discontinue levophed.
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using Arctic Sun cooling system 24
   hours in the setting of PEA arrest, has been at goal temp now. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - will start warming today.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known
   leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands. possible sources are lungs with
   aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, Clindamycin, and
   Zosyn, azithromycin
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he
   wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, femoral aline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down after overdosing on multiple drugs, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. He was intubated and resuscitated, but suffered from respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and PEA arrest. The patient has a history of bilateral pneumothoraces, bilateral effusions, and is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia.

Current medical issues:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is 4.5, and potassium is 7s. He is receiving dialysis for treatment of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
3. Shock: The patient is suspected to have cardiogenic shock, possibly secondary to PEA arrest, and is being treated with inotropic support.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis or shock liver.
5. Overdose: The patient is receiving supportive treatment for his overdose, including sedation and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pneumothoraces and bilateral effusions increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and muscle damage increase his risk of developing compartment syndrome.
4. Necrotizing fasciitis: The patient's leg trauma and redness increase his risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's hyperkalemia and shock increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure increases his risk of developing chronic renal failure.
7. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis increases his risk of developing liver failure.

Future plans:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support.
2. Continue dialysis for treatment of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
3. Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis.
4. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
5. Monitor for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal and liver function.
7. Plan for weaning from mechanical ventilation and extubation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT today.
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Neurological: The patient is intubated and sedated with midazolam and fentanyl. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not mentioned.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a potassium level of 7 mmol/L. He is receiving hemodialysis.
* Hepatic: The patient has transaminitis, with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).
* Infections: The patient has a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus, and his sputum culture is pending. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further support with mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
* Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may increase the risk of sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving hemodialysis. Further monitoring of his renal function is necessary.
* Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated, and he is receiving dialysis. Further monitoring of his muscle enzymes and renal function is necessary.
* Hepatic failure: The patient has transaminitis, and his liver function may be impaired. Further monitoring of his liver enzymes and coagulation studies is necessary.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further monitoring of his infection status and antibiotic therapy is necessary.

In summary, the patient is a 29-year-old male with a history of drug overdose, respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation. He is receiving mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Potential medical complications that can arise from his condition include respiratory failure, sepsis, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure, and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Month/Day (4) 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Month/Day (4) 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   [**11-5**] Blood culture: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Month/Day (4) 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Month/Day (4) 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of bilateral pneumothoracies and collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, as well as the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure may progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential complications such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient's PEA arrest was likely caused by a combination of factors, including hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. The patient is at risk of another cardiac arrest if these factors are not addressed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or hemolysis, which could lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may progress, leading to further liver damage and potential complications such as coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
7. Substance Abuse: The patient's substance abuse may lead to further complications, including withdrawal symptoms, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration and improve their chances of recovery."

   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT today.
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.  .  which was
   likely caused by hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC
   Shock: Resolved
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT today.
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is

   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.  .  which was
   likely caused by hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 29-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU after being found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation after PEA arrest in the emergency room.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/82 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's condition is stable, with some signs of improvement:

* Urine output has increased, with 75 cc of urine produced from midnight to 8 AM
* Patient is opening eyes when called, squeezing hands when requested, and following simple commands
* Sputum culture shows Staph aureus, with sensitivities pending

However, the patient still faces several medical complications:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to respiratory depression or aspiration
* Bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions
* Rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with creatinine levels of 4.5 mg/dL and potassium levels of 7 mmol/L
* Leukocytosis, with possible sources including the lungs and left leg
* Transaminitis, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis
* Shock, which has been resolved
* Overdose, with supportive treatment ongoing

The patient is receiving treatment for these complications, including:

* Mechanical ventilation with ARDS net protocol ventilation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin
* Sedation with midazolam and fentanyl
* Dialysis for treatment of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia
* Pain management with opioids
* Supportive care for overdose, including social work consult when the patient wakes up

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Sepsis, including septic shock, from the Staph aureus infection
* Renal failure, including acute kidney injury, from the rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia
* Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure, from the hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidemia
* Neurological complications, including seizures and cerebral edema, from the rhabdomyolysis and hypoxia
* Infections, including necrotizing fasciitis, from the trauma and redness overlying the leg."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT today.
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC
   Shock: Resolved
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he
   wakes up.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down after overdosing on multiple drugs, including cocaine, benzodiazepines, and opioids. He was intubated and resuscitated from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidemia. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoraces, and acute renal failure. He is also experiencing rhabdomyolysis and has a positive sputum culture for Staphylococcus aureus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if he is not weaned off the ventilator or if he develops further respiratory depression.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive sputum culture and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a risk for developing sepsis, particularly if the Staphylococcus aureus is methicillin-resistant (MRSA).
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if he does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation or if he develops further kidney damage.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment, including dialysis, and if he develops further muscle damage.
5. Infection: The patient's bilateral pneumothoraces and effusions may increase his risk for developing pneumonia or other infections.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient's positive Hepatitis C viral load may indicate a risk for developing liver damage or liver failure.
7. Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and muscle damage may increase his risk for developing compartment syndrome, particularly in his legs.
8. Shock: The patient's history of PEA arrest and ongoing hypotension may indicate a risk for developing shock, particularly if he does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation or if he develops further cardiovascular damage.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover the patient's positive sputum culture and to prevent the development of sepsis.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including dialysis, to manage the patient's acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid and medication regimen as necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to further evaluate the patient's risk for developing sepsis and to determine the best course of antibiotic therapy.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to further evaluate the patient's acute renal failure and to determine the best course of treatment.
7. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider consulting with a hepatologist if his liver function becomes abnormal.
8. Consider consulting with an orthopedic surgeon to further evaluate the patient's risk for developing compartment syndrome and to determine the best course of treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT again today.
   -Okay to switch to PS today, now that he is alert
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   fasciitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse and Hepatitis C who presented to the emergency department in cardiac arrest. He was found to have a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. He was intubated and received dialysis for hyperkalemia.

Current status:

* The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.
* He has bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions.
* He has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a potassium level of 7 mmol/L.
* He has rhabdomyolysis with a CK level of 260,000 IU/L.
* He has a history of PEA arrest, which was likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further dialysis to manage his kidney function.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is extremely elevated, and he may require further management to prevent further muscle damage.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and may be at risk for infection, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus.
5. Septic shock: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to septic shock.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient's history of trauma and redness over his leg may indicate the presence of compartment syndrome, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
7. Necrotizing fasciitis: The patient's history of trauma and redness over his leg may also indicate the presence of necrotizing fasciitis, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and dialysis as needed.
* He will be monitored for signs of respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and rhabdomyolysis.
* He will receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible infection.
* He will be monitored for signs of sepsis and septic shock.
* He will be managed for compartment syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis if present.
* He will receive social work consult when he wakes up to address his substance abuse and Hepatitis C."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - SBT: Minute volume was low. Changed to pressure support [**9-5**], minute
   volume was [**6-6**], placed on MMV.
   - PM HCT stable at 30.8. Fibrinogen, haptoglobin both WNL, FDP 10-40.
   Peripheral smear pending. LDH trending down.
   - Leg remained stable. Ortho signed off, call with questions.
   - Renal attempted to UF, however BP dipped at times--UF 1.7 kg.
   - IP: Recommended leaving chest tubes in place until after extubation
   given question of placement.
   - EMS team that brought in patient stopped by, additional information
   obtained: Patient was seen [**Street Address(1) 1553**], attempting to get into his
   company's vehicle, was having difficulty, metermaid noticed patient. He
   fell onto his buttock as he attempted to get into his vehicle. EMS
   alerted, patient was noted to smell of marijuana, argued with EMS that
   he was fine, but reported that his legs hurt and refused to move them.
   EMS reports difficulty appreciating radial pulse, carotid pulse at that
   time was 112. No evidence of trauma. Patient was brought to [**Hospital1 5**] ED,
   was in ED for about 1 1/2 minutes, then arrested. EMS records now in

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient Summary:

* 29-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of drug use (toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine) and found down with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubated after PEA arrest in the emergency room.
* Currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, and bilateral effusions.
* Patient has been weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and ABG values have been satisfactory.
* Has a history of rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels on admission, now trending down, and acute renal failure with a potassium level over 7.
* Has started to make urine, but is unlikely to make enough to correct his fluid balance in the next few days.
* Has been diagnosed with transaminitis, which is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo, but could also be from shock liver or hepatitis C.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral pneumothoraces and effusions may continue to cause respiratory distress, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's CK levels are still elevated, and he may require continued dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is still elevated, and he may require continued broad-spectrum antibiotics until speciation is done.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient's arrest was likely due to a combination of factors, including hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He may require continued monitoring of his mental status and cardiac function.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is still low, and he may require continued monitoring for hematoma or other possible bleeding sites.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may continue to cause liver dysfunction, and he may require continued treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to replenish glutathione stores.
7. Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, he may still require continued monitoring for signs of shock, such as decreased blood pressure and decreased urine output.
8. Substance Abuse: The patient's history of drug use may continue to pose a risk for further complications, and he may require continued supportive treatment and social work consult when he wakes up.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires continued close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Numeric Identifier 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Numeric Identifier 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Numeric Identifier 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Numeric Identifier 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine.
* He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.
* He has bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions.
* He has rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.5 and potassium level over 7.
* He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is currently receiving dialysis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory depression and acidemia may lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential kidney damage.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which may need to be further evaluated and treated.
* PEA Arrest: The patient's PEA arrest may have been caused by a combination of factors, including hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. Further monitoring is needed to ensure that the patient's cardiac status is stable.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may be caused by blood loss or bone marrow suppression, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
* Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be caused by muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis, shock liver, or hepatitis C. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
* Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but further monitoring is needed to ensure that the patient's hemodynamic status remains stable.
* Substance Abuse: The patient's substance abuse may be a contributing factor to his current condition, and social work consultation is recommended when he wakes up.
* Access: The patient's access lines may need to be adjusted or removed based on his ongoing medical needs.

**Plan:**

* Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed to manage the patient's respiratory status.
* Continue dialysis and adjust as needed to manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as needed.
* Further evaluate the patient's anemia and transaminitis to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
* Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust treatment as needed.
* Provide supportive care for the patient's substance abuse and consider social work consultation when he wakes up.
* Adjust the patient's access lines as needed to manage his ongoing medical needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, SBT going well this AM. Might need to rapidly
   taper sedation and extubate if he continues to do well.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.Self d/c'd
   left chest tube
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning well.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated after PEA arrest in the emergency room and has been in the ICU for several days. The patient has been experiencing respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions.

The patient has been weaned off sedation and is starting to make urine. His electrolytes are within normal limits, and he has been receiving dialysis as needed. The patient has also been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for a potential infection.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: secondary to respiratory depression and aspiration
* Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity
* Leukocytosis: secondary to acute stress or infection
* PEA Arrest: likely due to hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia
* Anemia: likely due to blood loss or hemolysis
* Transaminitis: likely secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo or shock liver
* Shock: resolved

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory depression and aspiration may lead to further respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his bilateral pneumothoracies.
2. Renal failure: the patient's acute renal failure may worsen if he does not receive adequate dialysis or if his underlying condition does not improve.
3. Infection: the patient's broad-spectrum antibiotics may not cover all potential infections, and he may develop resistance to antibiotics.
4. Bleeding: the patient's anemia and potential bleeding from his large right thigh may lead to further bleeding complications.
5. Cardiac complications: the patient's PEA arrest and cardiac hypoperfusion may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
6. Neurological complications: the patient's sedation and potential neurological damage from his PEA arrest may lead to further neurological complications, such as seizures or cognitive impairment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to provide broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjust the regimen as needed based on culture data.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide dialysis as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and provide transfusions as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide cardiac support as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide sedation as needed to manage his pain and anxiety."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely secondary
   to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology screen
   positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from being
   down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of right
   middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission, now
   normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs
   with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -  Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco, cefepime,
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -  Following culture data
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -  Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely secondary
   to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology screen
   positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from being
   down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of right
   middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission, now
   normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs
   with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -  Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco, cefepime,
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -  Following culture data
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -  Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation after PEA arrest in the emergency room. He is currently in the ICU with bilateral pneumothoraces, collapse of right middle and lower lobes, and bilateral effusions. He has been weaned off the ventilator and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) well.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to respiratory depression or aspiration pneumonia. He has been switched to ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net and has been weaning off oxygen as tolerated. His ABGs have been satisfactory.

The patient also has rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with a peak CK of 206,000, which is now trending down. He has started to make urine, but is unlikely to make enough to correct his fluid balance in the next few days. He has been treated with dialysis and is planned to have a tunneled line placed for long-term HD.

Other complications include leukocytosis, which could be secondary to acute stress or infection, and transaminitis, which is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo or shock liver. The patient has also had a PEA arrest, which was likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumothoraces: The patient's bilateral pneumothoraces could continue to cause respiratory distress and compromise his lung function.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis could lead to further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications such as compartment syndrome.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis could indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis could progress to liver failure and potentially life-threatening complications such as coagulopathy.
7. Shock: The patient's shock could recur and lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Hematoma: The patient's large right thigh could be at risk for hematoma formation, which could lead to further bleeding complications.
9. DIC: The patient's DIC could progress to life-threatening complications such as bleeding and organ dysfunction.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely secondary
   to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology screen
   positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from being
   down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of right
   middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission, now
   normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs
   with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -  Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco, cefepime,
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -  Following culture data
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -  Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from being
   down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of right
   middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission, now
   normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs
   with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -  Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco, cefepime,
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -  Following culture data
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -  Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated after a PEA arrest in the emergency room and is currently in the ICU. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoraces, and acute renal failure. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his sputum culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure are being treated with dialysis, and his electrolytes are being monitored. He has also been treated for possible compartment syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Pneumothoraces: The patient's bilateral pneumothoraces may continue to worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential organ failure.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further muscle damage and potential organ failure.
5. Infection: The patient's infection may worsen if not properly managed, leading to sepsis and potential organ failure.
6. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's possible compartment syndrome may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further tissue damage and potential organ failure.
7. Necrotizing Fasciitis: The patient's possible necrotizing fasciitis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further tissue damage and potential organ failure.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further infection and potential organ failure.
9. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further liver damage and potential organ failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies  with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Hypoxic overnight, improved with nasal trumpet
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Yesterday self discontinued left side
   with worsening of PTX, put in DART with resoluation.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days,
   will discontinue antibiotics, vanc still in system until HD tomorrow.
   Will give a dose of levoflox if gets dialyzed tday.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine increasing quickly
   without dialysis.  His rhabo was felt to be secondary to possible
   compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course, in for one, will call
   IR first thing in AM to ensure that he gets this early([**Numeric Identifier 1728**])
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures low, no [**Doctor First Name 91**]. Ortho signed off.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 6 days of
   vanco, 7^th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies  with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Hypoxic overnight, improved with nasal trumpet
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Yesterday self discontinued left side
   with worsening of PTX, put in DART with resoluation.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days,
   will discontinue antibiotics, vanc still in system until HD tomorrow.
   Will give a dose of levoflox if gets dialyzed tday.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine increasing quickly
   without dialysis.  His rhabo was felt to be secondary to possible
   compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course, in for one, will call
   IR first thing in AM to ensure that he gets this early([**Numeric Identifier 1728**])
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures low, no [**Doctor First Name 91**]. Ortho signed off.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 6 days of
   vanco, 7^th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation after PEA arrest in the emergency room. He was extubated on November 9th and has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with a DART on the left side and a chest tube on the left. He has a history of STAPH AUREUS infection from a sputum culture, which is pan-sensitive. He has been treated with vancomycin for 7 days and will discontinue antibiotics, with a planned dose of levofloxacin if he gets dialyzed today. He has rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with a creatinine increasing quickly without dialysis. He has leukocytosis, which may be secondary to acute stress or infection, and has a history of PEA arrest, which was likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He has anemia, transaminitis, and shock, which have been treated accordingly. He has a tunneled line planned for future HD and will be monitored for hematoma or other possible bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies, which may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of STAPH AUREUS infection, which may recur if not properly treated.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to acute kidney injury and other complications if not managed properly.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be a sign of infection or acute stress.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which may be a sign of liver damage or muscle breakdown.
8. Shock: The patient has had shock, which may recur if not managed properly.
9. Hematoma: The patient has a large right thigh, which may lead to hematoma or other bleeding complications.
10. Compartment Syndrome: The patient may have compartment syndrome, which may lead to muscle and nerve damage if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now extubated and doing well but
   still very lethargic
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance. Needed to
   replace left chest tube for enlarged PTX after tube was self-d/c'd
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Vanco, d/c cefepime, azithromycin with pan sensitive Staph
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C.
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now extubated and doing well but
   still very lethargic
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance. Needed to
   replace left chest tube for enlarged PTX after tube was self-d/c'd
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Vanco, d/c cefepime, azithromycin with pan sensitive Staph
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C.
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and PEA arrest. The patient is currently extubated and doing well, but still lethargic.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is still a concern, even after extubation. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure require continued dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, and volume state. Monitoring of his renal function and electrolyte levels is crucial.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be secondary to acute stress or infection. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and to prevent potential complications.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient's PEA arrest was likely caused by a combination of hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. Monitoring of his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis could be secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo, shock liver, or hepatitis C. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
7. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but close monitoring of his hemodynamic status is necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Substance Abuse: The patient's substance abuse requires supportive treatment and social work consultation when he wakes up.

In addition to these potential complications, the patient's large right thigh and possible compartment syndrome or necrotizing faciitis require close monitoring and further evaluation.

The patient's current medications include:

* Cefipime
* Vancomycin
* Azithromycin
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Heparin Sodium
* Albuterol nebs

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.9-14.4 K/uL
* Hct: 29.5-31.2 %
* Plt: 106-115 K/uL
* Cr: 4.6-9.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.54-0.83 ng/mL
* TCO2: 26 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT of the leg: Not consistent with necrotizing faciitis
* Transthoracic echocardiogram: Demonstrated global hypoperfusion

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, and volume state
* Monitoring of his renal function and electrolyte levels
* Close monitoring of his respiratory status
* Further evaluation of his leukocytosis and possible infection
* Monitoring of his cardiac status and possible complications of PEA arrest
* Monitoring of his anemia and possible bleeding or hemolysis
* Further evaluation of his transaminitis and possible causes
* Close monitoring of his hemodynamic status and possible complications of shock
* Supportive treatment and social work consultation for substance abuse
* Further evaluation of his large right thigh and possible compartment syndrome or necrotizing faciitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies  with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Hypoxic overnight, improved with nasal trumpet
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Yesterday self discontinued left side
   with worsening of PTX, put in DART with resoluation.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days,
   will discontinue antibiotics, vanc still in system until HD tomorrow.
   Will give a dose of levoflox if gets dialyzed tday.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine increasing quickly
   without dialysis.  His rhabo was felt to be secondary to possible
   compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course, in for one, will call
   IR first thing in AM to ensure that he gets this early([**Numeric Identifier 1728**])
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures low, no [**Doctor First Name 91**]. Ortho signed off.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 6 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation after PEA arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently extubated and has persistent bilateral pneumothoraces with DART on the left side and a chest tube on the left.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* HR: 78 bpm (75-86 bpm)
* BP: 175/87 mmHg (105-184/96 mmHg)
* RR: 34 inspirations per minute (18-45 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.3
* Hct: 31.4%
* Plt: 109
* Cr: 7.2
* TropT: 0.83
* TCO2: 26
* Glucose: 84
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.2 / 25.0 / 1.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 50 / 0.56, ALT / AST: 516 / 760, Alk Phos / T Bili: 66 / 0.6, Differential-Neuts: 80.8%, Lymph: 14.8%, Mono: 3.9%, Eos: 0.3%, Fibrinogen: 670 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 1517 IU/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.8 mg/dL, PO4: 5.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent bilateral pneumothoraces with DART on the left side and a chest tube on the left.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is increasing quickly without dialysis, and his rhabdomyolysis is likely secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC is 25 with 10% bands on admission, which could be secondary to acute stress or infection.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient's arrest was likely a combination of hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is 31, down from 35 yesterday, and he has a large right thigh, which may be at risk for hematoma or other bleeding.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are trending downward, which could be secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo, shock liver, or hepatitis C.
7. Shock: The patient has resolved shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of pneumothoraces
2. Further deterioration of renal function
3. Development of compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis
4. Infection (aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
5. Bleeding or hematoma in the right thigh
6. Further elevation of LFTs
7. Development of DIC or coagulopathy
8. Continued need for dialysis
9. Further respiratory compromise
10. Potential for further cardiac complications due to underlying substance abuse."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Patient satting well, weaned fro 40% to 4L NC overnight.
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Right chest tube to water seal, can
   likely pull today. Left still on wall suction.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. His rhabdo was felt to be
   secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Getting IR guided tunneled line today
   - HD today
   Hypertension: Has been trending high since last HD. Likely volume
   related. Planned to get dialyzed today, but in the interim, will treat
   with IV hydralazine PRN
   Altered Mental Status: Likely still has sedation on board, since has
   not been dialyzed since Saturday. Also contributing is uremia.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 29-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU after being found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated after PEA arrest in the emergency room and is currently extubated. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated and is now extubated with bilateral pneumothoracies and chest tubes.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a high creatine kinase level, indicating muscle breakdown, and is at risk for acute renal failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is trending high, likely due to volume overload.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely still sedated and has altered mental status due to uremia.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be secondary to acute stress or infection.
6. PEA Arrest: The patient's arrest was likely due to a combination of hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and he has a large right thigh, which may be at risk for hematoma.
8. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be secondary to muscle breakdown, shock liver, or hepatitis C.
9. Shock: The patient has resolved shock.

Plan:

1. Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia.
2. Obtain an IR-guided tunneled line today for future HD.
3. Wean the patient off oxygen and continue monitoring for respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and treat with IV hydralazine PRN.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider further evaluation for infection.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and consider transfusions as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust treatment as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory function
2. Development of acute renal failure
3. Progression of rhabdomyolysis
4. Hemorrhage or hematoma from the large right thigh
5. Infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis
6. Further liver damage or failure
7. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure
8. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke
9. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory alkalosis: extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient has persistent
   bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with reexpansion of
   lung. s/p chest tube on right, discontinued on [**11-11**]. Now hypoxic, 94%
   on 5L NC. Concern for possible pna in setting of low grade temp, vs.
   aspiration.
   - chest CT today without contrast.
   -sputum cx.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow left lower extremity clinically. If increasing pain re-consult
   ortho to assess for compartment syndrome.
   Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* LDH: 1517 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level was 206,000 on admission, which has trended down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is likely volume-related and is being treated with IV hydralazine PRN.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be secondary to acute stress or infection.
* PEA Arrest: The patient's arrest was felt to be a combination of hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is 31.2%, which is down from 35% yesterday.
* Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdo, shock liver, or hepatitis C.
* Substance abuse: The patient has a history of substance abuse and is being treated supportively.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of bilateral pneumothoracies and is at risk for developing pneumonia.
* Aspiration: The patient's low-grade fever and hypoxia suggest the possibility of aspiration.
* Compartment syndrome: The patient's rhabdo could be secondary to compartment syndrome, which could worsen if not monitored and treated.
* Hepatitis C: The patient's transaminitis could be secondary to hepatitis C, which could worsen if not treated.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his prolonged immobility and history of substance abuse.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to his critical illness and history of substance abuse.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged immobility and history of substance abuse.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia.
* Monitor the patient's left lower extremity clinically and re-consult ortho if increasing pain is noted.
* Treat the patient's hypertension with IV hydralazine PRN.
* Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation if it persists.
* Continue to monitor the patient's PEA arrest and consider further evaluation if it recurs.
* Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation if it persists.
* Continue to monitor the patient's transaminitis and consider further evaluation if it persists.
* Consider social work consult when the patient wakes up to address substance abuse issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Patient satting well, weaned fro 40% to 4L NC overnight.
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Right chest tube to water seal, can
   likely pull today. Left still on wall suction.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. His rhabdo was felt to be
   secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Getting IR guided tunneled line today
   - HD today
   Hypertension: Has been trending high since last HD. Likely volume
   related. Planned to get dialyzed today, but in the interim, will treat
   with IV hydralazine PRN
   Altered Mental Status: Likely still has sedation on board, since has
   not been dialyzed since Saturday. Also contributing is uremia.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Patient satting well, weaned fro 40% to 4L NC overnight.
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Right chest tube to water seal, can
   likely pull today. Left still on wall suction.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. His rhabdo was felt to be
   secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Getting IR guided tunneled line today
   - HD today
   Hypertension: Has been trending high since last HD. Likely volume
   related. Planned to get dialyzed today, but in the interim, will treat
   with IV hydralazine PRN
   Altered Mental Status: Likely still has sedation on board, since has
   not been dialyzed since Saturday. Also contributing is uremia.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation after PEA arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently in the ICU, extubated, and has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, hypertension, altered mental status, leukocytosis, PEA arrest, anemia, transaminitis, and shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest, further exacerbating his respiratory distress.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's ongoing rhabdomyolysis can lead to further muscle damage, increased serum creatinine levels, and potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring long-term dialysis or transplantation.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and stroke.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status can progress to coma, brain death, or permanent cognitive impairment.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis can be a sign of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
7. PEA arrest: The patient's PEA arrest can recur, potentially leading to cardiac arrest and death.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, potentially causing further complications.
9. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis can progress to liver failure, requiring liver transplantation.
10. Shock: The patient's shock can recur, potentially leading to cardiac arrest and death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and respond promptly to any changes or complications that arise to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of recovery."

   1. Compared to the CT of [**2177-11-4**], there is interval essential
   resolution of
   bilateral pneumothoraces. Tiny left pleural effusion is seen. Presumed
   left
   apical DART catheter terminates in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
   2. Ill-defined ground-glass and peribronchiolar opacities in the right
   upper
   lobe are decreased in number and extensiveness, consistent with
   improving
   inflammatory or infectious process. Few opacities in the left upper and
   left
   lower lobe, which may have been present previously but are difficult to
   compare due to previously collapsed left lower lobe.
   3. Subsegmental atelectasis persists in the reexpanded left lower
   lobe.
   There is mucous plugging of the bronchus intermedius on the right, with
   continued collapse of the right lower lobe and new partial atelectasis
   of the
   right middle lobe.
   4. New pneumomediastinum.
   5. Dialysis catheter terminating in the region of the inferior
   cavoatrial
   junction.

   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory alkalosis: extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient has persistent
   bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with reexpansion of
   lung. s/p chest tube on right, discontinued on [**11-11**]. Now hypoxic, 94%
   on 5L NC. Concern for possible pna in setting of low grade temp, vs.
   aspiration.
   - chest CT today without contrast.
   -sputum cx.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow left lower extremity clinically. If increasing pain re-consult
   ortho to assess for compartment syndrome.
   Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
     Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   1. Compared to the CT of [**2177-11-4**], there is interval essential
   resolution of
   bilateral pneumothoraces. Tiny left pleural effusion is seen. Presumed
   left
   apical DART catheter terminates in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
   2. Ill-defined ground-glass and peribronchiolar opacities in the right
   upper
   lobe are decreased in number and extensiveness, consistent with
   improving
   inflammatory or infectious process. Few opacities in the left upper and
   left
   lower lobe, which may have been present previously but are difficult to
   compare due to previously collapsed left lower lobe.
   3. Subsegmental atelectasis persists in the reexpanded left lower
   lobe.
   There is mucous plugging of the bronchus intermedius on the right, with
   continued collapse of the right lower lobe and new partial atelectasis
   of the
   right middle lobe.
   4. New pneumomediastinum.
   5. Dialysis catheter terminating in the region of the inferior
   cavoatrial
   junction.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory alkalosis: extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient has persistent
   bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with reexpansion of
   lung. s/p chest tube on right, discontinued on [**11-11**]. Now hypoxic, 94%
   on 5L NC. Concern for possible pna in setting of low grade temp, vs.
   aspiration.
   - chest CT today without contrast.
   -sputum cx.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow left lower extremity clinically. If increasing pain re-consult
   ortho to assess for compartment syndrome.
   Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
     Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
    Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD
   cath for future HD.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and PEA arrest in the emergency room. He was intubated, extubated on November 9, and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxic, 94% on 5L NC, with possible pneumonia (PNA) in the setting of low-grade fever, vs. aspiration.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertensive, likely volume-related, with a planned dialysis session today.
* Renal: Acute renal failure, with ongoing dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
* Neurological: Leukocytosis, WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized, possibly secondary to acute stress or infection.
* Hematological: Anemia, HCT 31, with no active bleeding noted, but with a large right thigh, requiring continued monitoring for hematoma or other possible bleeding.
* Hepatic: Transaminitis, likely secondary to muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis, but also possibly from shock liver or hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia (PNA) due to the patient's hypoxic state and possible aspiration.
2. Hypertensive crisis due to the patient's hypertensive state and potential volume overload.
3. Renal failure progression or worsening of acute renal failure due to ongoing rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
4. Bleeding complications due to the patient's anemia and possible hematoma or other bleeding in the right thigh.
5. Hepatic dysfunction or worsening of transaminitis due to ongoing muscle breakdown or shock liver.
6. Infection due to the patient's leukocytosis and possible secondary infection.
7. Cardiac complications due to the patient's PEA arrest and ongoing hypoperfusion.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Chest CT without contrast to evaluate for possible PNA.
2. Sputum and urine cultures to evaluate for possible infection.
3. Continued dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia.
4. Monitoring for hematoma or other bleeding in the right thigh.
5. Follow-up TTE in 4 weeks to evaluate for possible cardiac complications.
6. Supportive treatment for substance abuse, including social work consult when the patient wakes up."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   [**2177-11-12**] 7:43 PM
   1. Compared to the CT of [**2177-11-4**], there is interval essential
   resolution of
   bilateral pneumothoraces. Tiny left pleural effusion is seen. Presumed
   left
   apical DART catheter terminates in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
   2. Ill-defined ground-glass and peribronchiolar opacities in the right
   upper
   lobe are decreased in number and extensiveness, consistent with
   improving
   inflammatory or infectious process. Few opacities in the left upper and
   left
   lower lobe, which may have been present previously but are difficult to
   compare due to previously collapsed left lower lobe.
   3. Subsegmental atelectasis persists in the reexpanded left lower
   lobe.
   There is mucous plugging of the bronchus intermedius on the right, with
   continued collapse of the right lower lobe and new partial atelectasis
   of the
   right middle lobe.
   4. New pneumomediastinum.
   5. Dialysis catheter terminating in the region of the inferior
   cavoatrial
   junction.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory status: extubted ([**11-9**]). No longer with respiratory
   alkalosis. b/l pneumothoraces rersolved per chest CT [**2177-11-12**]. Also
   with RML, RLL collapse with right bronchus intermedius mucus plug.
   Still with O2 requirement
   -          f/u sputum cx
   -          Chest PT
    Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 12,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow right lower extremity clinically. Reporting increased pain.
   -ortho following, not concerned
    Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   -checking C. diff
   -started flagyl
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
     Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
    Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD
   cath for future HD.
   -DC subclavian line.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated after PEA arrest in the emergency room and extubated on 11/9. He has been experiencing respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and is currently receiving dialysis. His respiratory status has improved, with resolution of bilateral pneumothoraces and continued O2 requirement. He has also developed RML and RLL collapse with right bronchus intermedius mucus plug.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumomediastinum: May require further management and monitoring.
	* Right bronchus intermedius mucus plug: May require bronchoscopy or other interventions to clear the plug.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure: May require continued dialysis and close monitoring of renal function.
	* Rhabdomyolysis: May require continued dialysis and close monitoring of muscle breakdown.
3. Cardiac Complications:
	* PEA arrest: May have caused cardiac damage, requiring further evaluation and management.
	* Hypotension: May require further management and monitoring.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Pan-sensitive staph aureus: May require further antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of infection.
	* C. diff: May require further testing and management.
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia: May require further transfusions and close monitoring.
	* Transaminitis: May require further evaluation and management.
6. Neurological Complications:
	* Global hypoperfusion: May require further evaluation and management.
	* TTE: May require further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."
