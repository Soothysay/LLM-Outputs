   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/hypotension: These sx are all likely secondary to
   medication overdose. It is unclear what all the pt took, but there were
   many missing clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets.
   Plus husband thinks pt may have taken his bottle of ""pain medication.""
   So far tox urine and serum screens are negative, but these did not
   check for oxycodone derivatives or the other above medications. Tylenol
   and salisylate levels are negative. The sz could be related to
   trazadone and the hypotension could be from clonidine. If the pt did
   not OD, she may have had a sz related to having a low threshold from
   prior hx of multiple head injuries. Labs are not consistent with a
   septic explaination. Not due ot hypotension pt is at risk for anoxic
   injury, ARF, and liver damage. Also concern for serotonin syndrome due
   to possible SSRI ingestion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures, likely related to medication overdose.
* She has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts.
* The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a multi-lumen catheter in place.
* She has a new left internal jugular (IJ) central line, which is in satisfactory position.
* The patient has a fever of 101.2°F (38.4°C) and is receiving antibiotic infusions (vancomycin and zosyn).
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 93/67 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (bpm).
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), lactate, and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase).
* She has a pending blood culture and urine culture.
* The patient's imaging studies show borderline cardiomegaly, left ventricular configuration, and mild pulmonary vascular plethora, suggesting mild fluid overload.
* She has a pending toxicology report and is receiving medication to manage her symptoms, including ativan for seizure activity and levophed for blood pressure support.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Anoxic injury due to prolonged hypotension.
2. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to respiratory distress.
3. Liver damage due to medication overdose or hypotension.
4. Serotonin syndrome due to possible SSRI ingestion.
5. Infection, including sepsis, due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
7. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to hypotension and medications.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
9. Arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT), due to medication overdose or electrolyte imbalance.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of her symptoms, including:

* Frequent neuro checks and seizure management.
* Continuous ECG monitoring and electrolyte checks.
* Regular assessment of her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Monitoring of her liver enzymes and lactate levels.
* Pending toxicology and microbiology results.
* Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
* Continued antibiotic infusions and consideration of additional antibiotics if the patient's condition worsens.
* Close communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure coordination of care and management of her condition."

   SVC.
   No pneumothorax is detected.
   There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
   Possible
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though there is some overlying
   tubing. There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse
   and/or
   consolidation, unchanged. There is also atelectasis at the right base.
   Some
   pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is noted. There is
   mild
   pulmonary vascular plethora, more pronounced compared with earlier the
   same
   day, suggesting mild fluid overload. No right-sided effusion is
   identified. An
   IV-type catheter overlies the right upper chest near the apex, of

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10.
   - keep intubated for now, will not pursue SBT/extubation, given run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below) and likely inability to protect
   airway if WCT recurs
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned. Gave fluid boluses overnight.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia this morning, resolved with Bicarb infusion.
   Possibly [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications
   e.g. trazodone.
   - EKG for repeated episodes of WCT
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 200 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes
   - will check frequent EKGs tonight, Q1H for 6 hours
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Cultures sent. Possibly [**1-17**]
   cardioversions/seizure, vs infection. While hypotensive, will treat
   with antibiotics for sepsis picture.  Was given vanco and zosyn in ER.
   High risk for aspiration, given altered MS.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone for now
   - F/u cultures
   - avoiding levaquin so as to not lower seizure threshold

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   However,
   the side port overlies the lower esophagus. Compared with earlier the
   same
   day, a new left IJ central line is present -- the tip overlies proximal
   SVC.
   No pneumothorax is detected.
   There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
   Possible
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though there is some overlying
   tubing. There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse
   and/or
   consolidation, unchanged. There is also atelectasis at the right base.
   Some
   pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is noted. There is
   mild
   pulmonary vascular plethora, more pronounced compared with earlier the
   same
   day, suggesting mild fluid overload. No right-sided effusion is
   identified. An
   IV-type catheter overlies the right upper chest near the apex, of

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10.
   - keep intubated for now, will not pursue SBT/extubation, given run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below) and likely inability to protect
   airway if WCT recurs
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned. Gave fluid boluses overnight.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia this morning, resolved with Bicarb infusion.
   Possibly [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications
   e.g. trazodone.
   - EKG for repeated episodes of WCT
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 200 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes
   - will check frequent EKGs tonight, Q1H for 6 hours
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Cultures sent. Possibly [**1-17**]
   cardioversions/seizure, vs infection. While hypotensive, will treat
   with antibiotics for sepsis picture.  Was given vanco and zosyn in ER.
   High risk for aspiration, given altered MS.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone for now
   - F/u cultures

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures, likely due to a medication overdose. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia, and cultures have been sent. The patient is being treated with antibiotics empirically for sepsis. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as serotonin syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Serotonin syndrome: Given the patient's history of SSRI ingestion, there is a risk of developing serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and intubation make her at high risk for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be due to fluid overload, which can worsen her condition.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT and wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) makes her at risk for future arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's seizures and AMS may indicate neurological complications, which can worsen her condition.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows atelectasis and possible consolidation, which may indicate pneumonia.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's borderline cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular plethora may indicate cardiac complications, such as heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider echocardiography to assess cardiac function.
4. Consider starting anticonvulsant therapy to prevent further seizures.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies to evaluate for potential neurological complications.
6. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to evaluate the patient's respiratory status and consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for pneumonia.
7. Consider consulting a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac status and consider cardioversion to treat arrhythmias.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider psychiatric consultation to evaluate for potential psychiatric complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a multi-drug overdose, hypotension, and ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and vasopressor support.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 105 bpm
* Blood pressure: 105/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 276 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mEq/L
* Sodium: 141 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Glucose: 129 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are also provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished general appearance
* Endotracheal tube in place
* Normal cardiac examination
* Peripheral vascular examination is not assessed
* Respiratory examination is clear
* Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands, responds to tactile stimuli, and has no spontaneous movement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator is discontinued or if there is a delay in weaning.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is receiving antibiotics, which increases the risk of sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VT and is receiving antiarrhythmic medications, which increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Hypotension: The patient is receiving vasopressor support, and there is a risk of hypotension if the medication is discontinued or if there is a delay in weaning.
* Infection: The patient has a central line in place, which increases the risk of infection.
* Aspiration: The patient has a risk of aspiration due to the endotracheal tube and the possibility of a right lower lobe infiltrate.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to continue invasive ventilation, monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm, and wean the vasopressor support as able. The patient will also receive antibiotics empirically to cover for possible sepsis. The patient's code status is currently unknown, and further evaluation is needed to determine the patient's wishes regarding resuscitation."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures likely due to medication overdose. The patient has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. She was found to have mild clonus on examination, which is concerning for possible serotonin syndrome given the ingestion of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a wide complex tachycardia and has had episodes of sinus tachycardia with intraventricular cardiac disturbance (IVCD) or left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient's electrolytes are deranged, and she is requiring aggressive repletion.

The patient has a leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 x 10^9/L, and a fever of 101.2°F (38.2°C). Her sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative diplococci (GNdiplococci). She has been treated with vancomycin and aztreonam, and her blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient has a history of asthma, which is stable. She is NPO and has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place. Her family has been notified, and a social worker consult has been ordered.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Serotonin syndrome: Given the patient's history of SSRI ingestion, there is a risk of developing serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of wide complex tachycardia and sinus tachycardia with IVCD or LBBB increases her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation increases her risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and altered mental status increases her risk of developing neurological complications.
6. Infection: The patient's sputum gram stain showing GPC and GNdiplococci increases her risk of developing infection.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's deranged electrolytes increase her risk of developing electrolyte imbalance, which can be life-threatening.

Based on this information, I recommend that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU. The patient's medication regimen should be adjusted to address her cardiac arrhythmias, serotonin syndrome, and other potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of poisoning/overdose, likely due to trazodone ingestion. The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiac dysrhythmias, including wide complex tachycardia and LBBB/IVCD.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.7°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 264 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels. His blood cultures are pending, and he has been started on empiric antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

The patient's cardiac rhythm has been monitored, and he has been treated with bicarbonate infusion to narrow his QRS complex. He has also been started on prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention.

The patient's nutrition has been supplemented with glycemic control measures, and he has been receiving multi-lumen and arterial line infusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of trazodone overdose and cardiac dysrhythmias, including LBBB/IVCD, increases his risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support requires close monitoring, and he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his ventilation settings are not optimized.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending blood cultures suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests the possibility of renal failure, which could worsen his overall condition.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis and his elevated troponin-T level suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen his condition.
6. Central nervous system complications: The patient's history of trazodone overdose and cardiac dysrhythmias increases his risk for central nervous system complications, including seizures and cerebral edema.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and treatment for his cardiac dysrhythmias, respiratory support, and infection prophylaxis. His nutrition and glycemic control should be optimized, and his blood cultures should be closely monitored for signs of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   83msec and rate improved to low 100s, pt was started on a bicarb gtt,
   and will need to stay on it for 24 hours per tox. Pacer pads in place
   - tox recs: Give more charcoal, frequent EKGs, bicarb gtt at 150 to
   narrow QRS <100 (likely due to trazodone)
   - Had episode of sinus tach to 110s ON, EKG showed LBBB vs.
   Intraventricular Cardiac Disturbance (IVCD) with QRS 122. CE normal,

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely due to medication overdose. The patient has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts.

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

1. Seizures: The patient had a seizure episode, which was likely caused by medication overdose.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to clonidine intake.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient has experienced wide-complex tachycardia, which resolved with bicarbonate infusion. The patient also had sinus tachycardia with intraventricular cardiac disturbance (IVCD) vs. left bundle branch block (LBBB).
4. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may be related to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum gram stain showed GPC and GN diplococci, which may indicate pneumonia.
6. Possible serotonin syndrome: The patient has ingested SSRI medications, which may have caused serotonin syndrome.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

1. Intubation: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Propofol infusion: The patient is receiving a propofol infusion to help manage her hypotension.
3. Bicarbonate infusion: The patient is receiving a bicarbonate infusion to help manage her arrhythmia.
4. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin.
5. Aggressive fluid repletion: The patient is receiving aggressive fluid repletion to help manage her hypotension.
6. Monitoring: The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition, including seizure activity, arrhythmia, and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate the development of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory status may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's history of arrhythmia and medication overdose may lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure activity and potential serotonin syndrome may lead to neurological complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory status may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures. She is suspected to have ingested clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets, possibly with her husband's narcotics. The patient is intubated and sedated, and her vital signs are being closely monitored. She has a history of asthma, and her current condition is stable. She also has a swollen left hand, likely due to IV attempts.

Medical Complications:

1. AMS: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and it is essential to monitor her neurological status closely.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient's QRS widening is likely due to hydroxyzine, and it raises the question of a bezoar. A gastrointestinal series (GI c/s) is planned to evaluate for a bezoar.
3. Suicidal Ideation: The patient's presumed suicidal ideation is a concern, and a social worker and a psychologist will be involved in her care.
4. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient is on a bicarbonate drip, and her electrolytes will be closely monitored and repleted as needed.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to clonidine intake, and she is being treated with propofol and levophed.
6. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci, and she is at risk for sepsis.
7. Swollen L hand: The patient's swollen left hand is likely due to IV attempts, and it will be monitored and treated with warm packs and elevation.
8. Asthma: The patient's asthma is stable, but she is off her home medications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, neurological status, and electrolytes closely.
2. Continue the patient's treatment with propofol and levophed.
3. Perform a GI series to evaluate for a bezoar.
4. Continue to monitor the patient for sepsis and adjust her treatment as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's swollen left hand and treat as needed.
6. Consider weaning the patient off the bicarbonate drip.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's suicidal ideation and involve a social worker and a psychologist in her care.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's asthma and adjust her treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and new onset seizures. The seizures are likely related to presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets.
* The patient is intubated and sedated for now, with plans to keep her intubated and monitor her neurological status every 2 hours.
* The patient has had episodes of wide complex tachycardia and narrow QRS complex, which resolved with bicarbonate administration. The QRS widening is likely related to hydroxyzine.
* The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including levofloxacin, aztreonam, and vancomycin, due to the presence of GPC and GN diplococci in her sputum.
* The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension, which are likely related to sepsis.
* The patient has a swollen left hand, which is likely due to IV attempts.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L, and she is being aggressively repleted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of GPC and GN diplococci in her sputum.
* Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, due to the administration of bicarbonate and other medications.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to the presence of GPC and GN diplococci in her sputum.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, due to the ingestion of trazodone and other medications.
* Neurological complications, such as seizures, due to the ingestion of clonidine and other medications.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, due to the patient's altered mental status and intubation.
* Skin and soft tissue complications, such as cellulitis, due to the patient's swollen left hand."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

* The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely related to the ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets.
* The patient is intubated and sedated, and is being monitored for arrhythmias, including QRS widening, which is likely related to hydroxyzine.
* The patient has a parapneumonic effusion on CXR, which is likely related to RML/RLL aspiration.
* The patient has suicidal ideation, and a social work consult and psychiatric consult have been ordered.
* The patient has electrolyte abnormalities, including hypocalcemia, and is being treated with a bicarbonate drip.
* The patient has leukocytosis and fever, likely related to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
* The patient has a swollen left hand, likely related to IV attempts.
* The patient has asthma, which is stable, and is currently NPO with a nasogastric tube (NGT).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to the patient's history of QRS widening and the presence of hydroxyzine.
* Respiratory failure, due to the patient's intubation and sedation.
* Sepsis, due to the patient's leukocytosis and fever.
* Bezoar formation, due to the patient's history of ingesting multiple medications.
* Pneumonia, due to the patient's parapneumonic effusion.
* Suicidal behavior, due to the patient's suicidal ideation.
* Electrolyte imbalances, due to the patient's bicarbonate drip and potential for fluid overload.
* Infection, due to the patient's presence of GPC and GNdiplococci in their sputum.
* Cardiovascular instability, due to the patient's hypotension and potential for pressor requirement.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and electrolyte levels, and to adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with AMS and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely
   [**1-17**] to presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and
   trazadone tablets, +/- husband
s narcotics.
   # AMS: SBT and extubation likely today
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend electrolytes every 8 hours and LFTs daily; also trend ABGs
   every 8 hours per below
   - Appreciate toxicology following: Wil decrease bicarb gtt to half and
   try to wean off today
   - SW consult for family
 already saw husband; will need psych consult
   once extubated and 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon ([**Hospital1 7**])
   - Will check ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL
   aspiration
   - Will check volume with ultrasound
   - Thoracentesis if sufficient volume to tap
   # Suicidal Ideation: Presumed
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   # Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now on Propofol gtt. BP
   may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol weaned.
   Levophed gtt for MAP>65 weaned and now off >24 hours
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Goal UOP>30cc/hr, MAP>65
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. WBC
   gradually improving
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - On Vanc/Meropenem Day [**2-20**] given concerns for lowering seizure
   threshold and widening QRS (as pt already has); increased Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   # Swollen L hand: Likely [**1-17**] IV attempts. No evidence of cellulites.
   - monitor
   - warm packs, elevation
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - Off home meds
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, has NGT for suctioning only. If extubated today,
   will swallow trial at bedside and possibly advance diet or start TPN

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and new onset seizures. The patient is suspected to have ingested clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets, possibly with her husband's narcotics. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving propofol and heparin infusions.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizure activity:** The patient has a history of seizures and is currently receiving anticonvulsant medication. However, the risk of seizure activity remains, especially with the continued use of propofol and the presence of other seizure medications.
2. **Arrhythmia:** The patient has a history of cardiac arrhythmia, and the ECG shows a QRS complex within normal limits. However, the patient is still at risk for arrhythmia, especially with the use of propofol and the presence of other medications that can affect cardiac conduction.
3. **Parapneumonic effusion:** The patient has a parapneumonic effusion on CXR, which may require thoracentesis if the volume is sufficient.
4. **Suicidal ideation:** The patient is suspected to have suicidal ideation, and a psychiatric consult is recommended once extubated and with a 1:1 sitter.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may persist due to the continued use of propofol and the presence of other medications that can affect blood pressure.
6. **Leukocytosis/fever:** The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may be related to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. The patient is at risk for sepsis and requires close monitoring.
7. **Swollen L hand:** The patient has a swollen L hand, which may be related to IV attempts. The patient requires monitoring and treatment for cellulitis if present.
8. **Asthma:** The patient has asthma, which is currently stable. However, the patient may require adjustments to their asthma medication once extubated.
9. **Nutritional issues:** The patient is NPO for now, but may require nutritional support once extubated, such as TPN or enteral nutrition.
10. **Cardiac dysrhythmia:** The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, and the ECG shows a QRS complex within normal limits. However, the patient is still at risk for cardiac dysrhythmia, especially with the use of propofol and the presence of other medications that can affect cardiac conduction.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust medication as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and fever, and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's swollen L hand and treat cellulitis if present.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's asthma medication once extubated.
6. Consider nutritional support once extubated, such as TPN or enteral nutrition.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac dysrhythmia and adjust medication as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration of gastric contents during cardioversion/seizure/intubation, as indicated by the presence of GPC and GNdiplococci in the sputum.
	* Respiratory failure due to hypotension and potential sepsis.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's history of seizures and potential toxic effects of the ingested medications.
	* Hypotension, which may be related to the patient's history of clonidine intake and the potential effects of propofol on blood pressure.
	* Cardiac tamponade or pericarditis due to the patient's history of seizures and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures, which may be related to the patient's history of ingesting clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone.
	* Neurological toxicity due to the potential effects of the ingested medications on the central nervous system.
	* Cerebral edema or herniation due to the patient's history of seizures and potential increased intracranial pressure.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis due to the patient's history of aspiration and potential bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract.
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI) due to the patient's history of catheterization and potential bacterial colonization of the urinary tract.
5. Other Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding, due to the patient's history of ingesting medications and potential gastrointestinal toxicity.
	* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, due to the patient's history of hypotension and potential nephrotoxicity of the ingested medications.
	* Hepatic complications, such as acute liver injury or chronic liver disease, due to the patient's history of ingesting medications and potential hepatic toxicity.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent an endoscopy procedure on 2141-1-31 at 06:00 PM, which revealed no bezoar. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with an RSBI of 80 and PSV of 5/5.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of antibiotic administration and the presence of fever may indicate the development of sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate AKI.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac rhythm is stable, but the presence of cardiac disease and the use of propofol may increase the risk of arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of endoscopy and the presence of gastrointestinal disease may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and the presence of central venous lines may increase the risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and the use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and the use of insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Perform regular assessments of the patient's neurological status.
3. Consider performing a head CT scan to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
5. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen if sepsis is suspected.
6. Monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine levels closely to assess for AKI.
7. Consider performing a stress ulcer prophylaxis.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adding antiarrhythmic medications if arrhythmias develop."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets, possibly with her husband's involvement. The patient is intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. AMS: The patient is at risk for further seizures, and her neuro checks are being performed every 2 hours. She is also being treated with ativan PRN for seizure activity.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient has a normal QRS complex, and her bicarbonate drip has been discontinued. She will be monitored for arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Parapneumonic effusion: The patient has a suspected parapneumonic effusion, which is likely due to aspiration during cardioversion, seizure, or intubation. She will be monitored for volume status and may require thoracentesis if the effusion is significant.
4. Suicidal ideation: The patient's husband has suicidal ideation, and a social worker consultation has been arranged for the family.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to clonidine intake, and she is being treated with propofol and levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure of >65 mmHg.
6. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has a suspected aspiration pneumonia, and she is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. She will be monitored for sepsis and will have follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
7. Swollen L hand: The patient has a swollen left hand, which is likely due to IV attempts. She will be monitored and treated with warm packs and elevation.
8. Asthma: The patient's asthma is stable, and she is off her home medications.

The patient's medications include:

* Propofol
* Levophed
* Vancomycin
* Meropenem
* Ativan
* Hydroxyzine
* Trazadone
* Citalopram
* Clonidine

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7 K/uL
* Hct: 30.2%
* Plt: 218 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 32 mmHg
* Glucose: 116 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 175 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* SBT and extubation likely today
* Neuro checks every 2 hours
* F/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
* Ativan PRN for seizure activity
* Trend electrolytes every 6 hours and LFTs daily
* Appreciate toxicology following
* SW consult for family
* Psych consult once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
* Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, and MAP >65
* Continue treatment with vancomycin and meropenem
* Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Monitor for arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitor for parapneumonic effusion and consider thoracentesis if necessary
* Monitor for suicidal ideation and provide supportive care to the patient and her family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely related to a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets. She was previously intubated but was extubated and is now on nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. She has a fever of 37.6°C and is receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature and white blood cell count are elevated, suggesting an infection. She is receiving antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of sepsis is necessary.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a normal QRS interval, but her electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be related to her underlying condition or medications. Close monitoring and treatment as necessary are important.
5. Suicidal ideation: The patient has a history of suicidal thoughts, and close monitoring and treatment by a mental health professional are necessary.
6. Parapneumonic effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows a possible parapneumonic effusion, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which may indicate an underlying condition or medication side effect.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may require treatment to prevent complications.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's diet has been advanced to regular, but close monitoring of her nutritional status is necessary to prevent deficiencies."

   54F with AMS and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely
   [**1-17**] to presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and
   trazadone tablets, +/- husband
s narcotics.
   # AMS: Extubated. Per psychiatry yesterday, still mildly delirious
   - neuro checks Q2H
 q4h
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend electrolytes and ABGs [**Hospital1 7**] now (Aline removed yesterday)
   - Appreciate toxicology following: Bicarb gtt turned off yesterday
   early evening with q1hr EKG checks that were WNL
   - SW consult for family
 already saw husband; appreciate psych consult
   and 1:1 sitter
 will consider restarting Risperdal qHS
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKGs q8h
   - Will check ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above (electrolytes more
   stable now)
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL
   aspiration
   - Will monitor by EKG
   # Suicidal Ideation: Presumed
   - Social Work c/s for family appreciated
   - Psychiatry following also appreciated; patient with 1:1 sitter now
   # Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now extubated and still
   with relative hypotension
   - [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to monitor
   - Goal UOP>30cc/hr, MAP>65
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. WBC
   gradually improving, no low-grade fevers X~24 hours
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - On Vanc/Meropenem Day [**3-23**] given concerns for lowering seizure
   threshold and widening QRS (as pt already has); increased Vancomycin
   yesterday and will check trough tomorrow morning
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   # Swollen L hand: Likely [**1-17**] IV attempts. No evidence of cellulites.
   - monitor
   - warm packs, elevation
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - Off home meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, possibly with her husband's involvement. She was intubated and on pressors, but has since been extubated and is off pressors. Her delirium has improved, and she is able to swallow and advance to a regular diet. Her toxicology screen has shown that her bicarb gtt has been turned off, and her EKGs have been normal. She has a parapneumonic effusion on CXR, which is likely due to RML/RLL aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's parapneumonic effusion and aspiration may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and presumed clonidine intake may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's AMS and seizure activity may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or brain damage.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis or organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's NGT and aspiration may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or GI bleeding.
6. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's presumed suicidal ideation and history of psychiatric medications may lead to psychiatric complications, such as depression or anxiety.
7. Endocrine Complications: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalances may lead to endocrine complications, such as adrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalances may lead to renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems. She should be monitored for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological deterioration. Her electrolyte imbalances should be aggressively managed, and her blood glucose levels should be closely monitored. Her psychiatric status should be closely monitored, and she should be provided with a 1:1 sitter to prevent suicidal ideation. Her family should be provided with education and support to help manage her care and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of invasive ventilation, arterial line, and pressors. The patient has been extubated and is now off pressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 218 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and their troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL. The patient's liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent overdose, and they have been treated with various medications, including heparin, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient's allergy list includes penicillin G, sulfonamide antibiotics, and an unknown allergy.

The patient's physical examination is notable for 1+ edema in the left upper extremity. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive and following simple commands.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 2%. The patient's ventilator mode is CPAP/PSV, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's FiO2 is 2%, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient's PIP is 11 cmH2O, which may be high, increasing the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is 7.7 K/uL, which may indicate an infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.
3. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a normal sinus rhythm, but the patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, which may indicate renal dysfunction.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic examination is normal, but the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not provided. The patient's blood glucose level is 116 mg/dL, which may be high, increasing the risk of neurologic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's sputum gram stain shows GPC/GNdiplococci, which may indicate a respiratory infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac dysrhythmia, neurologic complications, and infection. The patient's laboratory results and physical examination are within normal limits, but the patient's medical history and current treatment plan may increase the risk of these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy, shock, seizures, and respiratory failure due to a suspected polysubstance overdose. She has been improving, with her encephalopathy, seizures, and shock resolving. She is currently on nasal cannula for oxygen support and has been extubated. She has a history of allergies to penicillin G, sulfa, and unknown antibiotics. She has received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, aztreonam, meropenem, and vancomycin.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 103/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Thin general appearance
* Clear breath sounds
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive and responsive to verbal stimuli
* Purposeful movement
* Normal tone

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 218 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 31 mg/dL
* Glucose: 116 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): given the patient's history of prolonged intubation and the presence of fever, VAP is a potential complication.
2. Septic shock: the patient's history of shock and the presence of fever and leukocytosis suggest that septic shock is a potential complication.
3. Renal failure: the patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest that renal failure is a potential complication.
4. Hepatic failure: the patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest that hepatic failure is a potential complication.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient's history of cardiac monitoring and the presence of a sinus rhythm suggest that cardiac arrhythmias are a potential complication.
6. Neurological complications: the patient's history of seizures and encephalopathy suggest that neurological complications are a potential complication.
7. Infection: the patient's history of prolonged intubation and the presence of fever suggest that infection is a potential complication.
8. Hemodynamic instability: the patient's history of shock and the presence of tachycardia suggest that hemodynamic instability is a potential complication."
