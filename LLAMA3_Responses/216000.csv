   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity, OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP),
   COPD, history of PE. Since admission, pt treated with azithro for
   bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP
   (vanc/cefepime) if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
   - continue IV lasix for goal -1L (pt received laxix IV 40mg x 2
   overnight after BNP showed 5977)
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue nebs
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       COPD
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   - continue heparin (one more day) and coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - order B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity, OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP),
   COPD, history of PE. Since admission, pt treated with azithro for
   bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP
   (vanc/cefepime) if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
   - continue IV lasix for goal -1L (pt received laxix IV 40mg x 2
   overnight after BNP showed 5977)
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue nebs
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       COPD
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   - continue heparin (one more day) and coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - order B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, DM, PE, COPD, and OSA. She presented with RLE pain and SOB and was treated with azithro and heparin. On the floor, she had desaturations and somnolence, and was found to be taking her BIPAP off overnight with a SaO2 of 40%. She was then transferred to the ICU where she developed atrial fibrillation, hypercarbia, and worsening hypoxia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by her obesity, OSA, COPD, and history of PE.
2. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible right CHF or PE increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock or pulmonary embolism.
3. **Infection:** The patient's history of PE and bronchitis, as well as the presence of bilateral perihilar opacities on the chest radiograph, suggest a high risk of infection, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. **Anemia:** The patient's baseline HCT of 30-38 and MCV of 107 suggest a possible anemia, which can exacerbate her respiratory failure and increase the risk of bleeding.
5. **Chronic Kidney Disease:** The patient's history of DM and HTN, as well as her current kidney function, suggest a high risk of chronic kidney disease, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
6. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's history of OSA and COPD increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or bowel obstruction.
7. **Pain Management:** The patient's chronic pain and history of PE increase the risk of pain management complications, such as opioid use disorder or respiratory depression.

**Plan:**

1. Continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
2. Continue IV lasix for goal -1L and titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.
3. Continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation.
4. Repeat echocardiogram and monitor for cardiovascular complications.
5. Order B12 and folate levels to assess for anemia.
6. Monitor I/Os and avoid nephrotoxins to prevent acute kidney injury.
7. Continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves.
8. Continue home DM diet and FS QID.
9. Continue home statin and levothyroxine.
10. Continue home metoprolol."

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), history of PE. Since admission, pt treated
   with azithro for bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - discontinue azithro (patient has completed 5 day course)
   - broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP (vanc/cefepime) if clinical
   condition deteriorates or becomes febrile
   - continue IV lasix 40mg for goal -2L for today to treat right sided
   heart failure
   - start lasix drip
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - calculate urine anion gap
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          restart coumadin tomorrow (INR today was 3.1)
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - followup B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   -          change home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), history of PE. Since admission, pt treated
   with azithro for bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - discontinue azithro (patient has completed 5 day course)
   - broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP (vanc/cefepime) if clinical
   condition deteriorates or becomes febrile
   - continue IV lasix 40mg for goal -2L for today to treat right sided
   heart failure
   - start lasix drip
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - calculate urine anion gap
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          restart coumadin tomorrow (INR today was 3.1)
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - followup B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   -          change home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, DM, and PE who presented with RLE pain and SOB. She was treated with azithro and started on heparin for subtherapeutic INR. On the floor, the patient experienced desaturations and somnolence, and was found to be taking off her BIPAP mask. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU and diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and possible pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, given her obesity, OSA, and history of PE. She requires continued treatment with IV lasix for right-sided heart failure and consideration of broadening antibiotic coverage.
2. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma and is being treated with Advair and monteleukast. Her respiratory status should be closely monitored.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and initial presentation was clinically concerning for PE. She should be continued on heparin and coumadin therapy.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient's BIPAP settings should be titrated for best ventilation, and she should continue to receive treatment for OSA.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 30-38, and her iron studies are normal. She should continue to receive home iron therapy and follow-up B12 and folate levels.
6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.3-1.8, and her I/Os should be closely monitored to avoid nephrotoxins.
7. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and should continue to receive home pain medications once her respiratory status improves.
8. Type 2 DM: The patient's DM should be managed with diet and FS QID while in the hospital.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia should be managed with home statin therapy.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be managed with home levothyroxine therapy.
11. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed with metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and anticoagulation.
12. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and should continue to receive metoprolol and warfarin therapy for rate control and anticoagulation.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: NPO until mental status clears
* Glycemic control: Continue IV lasix for right-sided heart failure
* Lines: Continue to monitor and maintain IV lines
* Prophylaxis: Continue DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Communication: Continue to communicate with patient and family regarding plan and progress
* Code status: Full code
* Disposition: Continue ICU care until respiratory status normalizes"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with right lower extremity (RLE) pain and shortness of breath (SOB). She was bridged into therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) with heparin and warfarin. The patient's condition has been unstable, with desaturation and somnolence while off bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) mask.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including a trans-thoracic echo, non-invasive ventilation, and sputum culture. The echo revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. The patient's blood gases have been abnormal, with a pH of 7.29 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 66 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her morbid obesity, and she has not been able to participate in a thorough examination. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 110/99 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as abnormal coagulation studies. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. Her glucose levels are also elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.

The patient's diagnosis is likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to her respiratory failure and abnormal blood gases. She may also have a secondary infection, given the presence of pneumonia on her chest X-ray.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels could lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies could lead to bleeding complications, particularly if she undergoes invasive procedures or has a traumatic injury.

The patient's management plan should include:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotics to treat her pneumonia and potential secondary infections.
3. Aggressive fluid management to prevent further kidney dysfunction.
4. Tight glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia complications.
5. Coagulation monitoring and management to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results to quickly identify any changes or complications."

   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), possibly history of PE. ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now
   increased to 30. Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA,
   developing CHF, infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and
   echo was normal.
   - continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her if not bleeding.
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels
   were above reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), possibly history of PE. ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now
   increased to 30. Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA,
   developing CHF, infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and
   echo was normal.
   - continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her if not bleeding.
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels
   were above reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a complex medical history, including morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, DM, PE, COPD, OSA, and hypertension. She presented to the hospital with RLE pain and SOB, and has since been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is characterized by worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence. Her respiratory status is compromised, with a diagnosis of hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure likely multifactorial in origin. The patient's ABGs show respiratory acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation, and her HCO3 levels have increased to 30.

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest several potential complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's obesity, OSA, and possible history of PE may contribute to her respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of PE and initial presentation may suggest cardiac failure, although serial enzymes and echo were normal.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture was contaminated, and she has a history of PE, which may indicate an underlying infection.
4. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma, and her COPD may be contributing to her respiratory failure.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PE and initial presentation may suggest a pulmonary embolism.
6. Anemia: The patient's baseline HCT is 30-38, and her MCV is 107, which may indicate anemia.
7. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's DM and hypertension may be contributing to her chronic kidney disease.
8. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure.
9. Type 2 DM: The patient's DM may be contributing to her respiratory failure and chronic kidney disease.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may be contributing to her cardiovascular risk.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr to goal -1L for today given her elevated BNP and edema.
2. Continue ROMI with enzymes.
3. Titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.
4. Continue gentle ativan PRN.
5. Continue daily ABG via arterial line.
6. Follow up sputum cultures.
7. Continue advair and monteleukast for asthma.
8. Discontinue heparin and hold coumadin today.
9. Continue BIPAP for OSA.
10. Continue to follow blood counts and monitor I/Os for CKD.

The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the ICU for further management and treatment."

   INPATIENT
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   - decrease IV lasix to 4mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - transition to bolus lasix
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures from yesterday
   - repeat sputum cultures today given productive cough
   - CXR today given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit.
   - give 5mg metoprolol IV push now
   - discontinue 5mg IV Q6H metoprolol and start home regimen of 25mg PO
   TID (if unsuccessful at controlling rate, consider esmolol or
   diltiazem)
   - continue warfarin for anticoagulation (goal INR [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her with vitamin K if not bleeding.
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol 25mg TID
   7.       Anemia
  MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels were above
   reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   INPATIENT
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   - decrease IV lasix to 4mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - transition to bolus lasix
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures from yesterday
   - repeat sputum cultures today given productive cough
   - CXR today given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit.
   - give 5mg metoprolol IV push now
   - discontinue 5mg IV Q6H metoprolol and start home regimen of 25mg PO
   TID (if unsuccessful at controlling rate, consider esmolol or
   diltiazem)
   - continue warfarin for anticoagulation (goal INR [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her with vitamin K if not bleeding.
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol 25mg TID
   7.       Anemia
  MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels were above
   reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a complex medical history, including morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and COPD, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure. She is receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and has been desaturated to the 70s.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) controlled on metoprolol. She has been experiencing Afib in the ICU and is being treated with metoprolol IV push and oral metoprolol.
3. PE: The patient has a history of PE and was initially clinically concerning for PE. She has been in therapeutic INR range for 24 hours and is being treated with warfarin.
4. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma and is being treated with Advair and montelukast.
5. OSA: The patient has a history of OSA and is being treated with BIPAP.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 107. The cause of anemia is likely hypothyroidism.
8. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has CKD likely due to diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
9. Chronic pain: The patient has chronic pain and is being treated with home pain medications.
10. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is being treated with diet and insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her respiratory acidosis is not adequately treated.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. PE: The patient's PE may worsen if not treated properly.
4. OSA: The patient's OSA may worsen if her BIPAP settings are not optimized.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated properly.
6. CKD: The patient's CKD may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus may worsen if not managed properly.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. NIPPV and BIPAP to manage respiratory failure.
2. Metoprolol IV push and oral metoprolol to manage atrial fibrillation.
3. Warfarin to manage PE.
4. Advair and montelukast to manage obstructive lung disease.
5. BIPAP to manage OSA.
6. Metoprolol to manage hypertension.
7. Iron supplements to manage anemia.
8. Monitoring of I/Os to manage CKD.
9. Avoidance of nephrotoxins to manage CKD.
10. Home pain medications to manage chronic pain.
11. Diet and insulin to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit. Pt still
   tachycardic.
   - continue increased regimen of 37.5mg PO TID (if unsuccessful at
   controlling rate, consider esmolol or diltiazem)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE. Pt also has Afib.
   - continue coumadin as above
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit. Pt still
   tachycardic.
   - continue increased regimen of 37.5mg PO TID (if unsuccessful at
   controlling rate, consider esmolol or diltiazem)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE. Pt also has Afib.
   - continue coumadin as above
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a complex medical history, including obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of shortness of breath and right lower extremity (RLE) pain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is experiencing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in origin. The patient has a history of OSA and is non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure (BIPAP) therapy. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show respiratory acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation, despite an increase in bicarbonate levels.
* Cardiac status: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a history of controlled AF on metoprolol. The patient's heart rate remains tachycardic, and the physician has increased the metoprolol dosage to 37.5mg three times a day (TID).
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is currently being treated with coumadin.
* Obstructive lung disease: The patient has asthma, which is being managed with Advair and montelukast.
* OSA: The patient is being treated with BIPAP therapy.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and the physician is monitoring it closely.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is being managed with home iron therapy.
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient likely has CKD secondary to DM and hypertension.
* Chronic pain: The patient has chronic pain, which is being managed with home pain medications.
* Type 2 DM: The patient has uncontrolled DM, which is being managed with a diabetic diet and insulin therapy.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with a statin.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and the patient is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's AF is not well-controlled, and the patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
3. PE: The patient has a history of PE and is at risk of developing further thrombotic events.
4. CKD progression: The patient's CKD is likely to progress if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state makes them susceptible to infection.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's uncontrolled DM increases the risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not managed properly.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive respiratory support with BIPAP therapy.
2. Cardiovascular management: The patient will continue to receive metoprolol therapy to control AF and hypertension.
3. Pulmonary embolism treatment: The patient will continue to receive coumadin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Anemia management: The patient will continue to receive home iron therapy to manage anemia.
5. Chronic pain management: The patient will continue to receive home pain medications to manage chronic pain.
6. Type 2 DM management: The patient will continue to receive a diabetic diet and insulin therapy to manage uncontrolled DM.
7. Hyperlipidemia management: The patient will continue to receive a statin to manage hyperlipidemia.
8. Hypothyroidism management: The patient will continue to receive levothyroxine therapy to manage hypothyroidism.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib. Pt still tachycardic.
   - increase metoprolol to 50.0mg PO TID (esmolol not appropriate because
   it is only available IV)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       Altered Mental Status
 patient not at baseline mental status
   according to PCP and nurses who have cared for her previously.  Most
   likely due to delirium from hospital stay (passive variant).
   - Gentle reorientation (talking, getting her out of bed)
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.  Improving as evidenced by
   decreasing Cre.  Perfusion improving after fluid reduction.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib. Pt still tachycardic.
   - increase metoprolol to 50.0mg PO TID (esmolol not appropriate because
   it is only available IV)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       Altered Mental Status
 patient not at baseline mental status
   according to PCP and nurses who have cared for her previously.  Most
   likely due to delirium from hospital stay (passive variant).
   - Gentle reorientation (talking, getting her out of bed)
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.  Improving as evidenced by
   decreasing Cre.  Perfusion improving after fluid reduction.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with shortness of breath and right lower extremity (RLE) pain. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, obstructive lung disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 113 beats per minute (98-129 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 143/78 mmHg (102/57-149/118 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (17-27 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 90%
* Arterial blood gas (ABG) results: pH 7.41, pCO2 53 mmHg, pO2 207 mmHg

The patient has been treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and has shown improvement in her oxygenation. However, she remains hypoxic and hypercarbic.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count (CBC): WBC 12.1 x 10^9/L, RBC 3.15 x 10^12/L, Hgb 10.9 g/dL, Hct 32.9%
* Blood chemistry: Glucose 154 mg/dL, urea nitrogen 23 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 96 mmol/L, bicarbonate 30 mmol/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure may progress to respiratory arrest if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen and lead to cardiac arrest if not controlled.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium if not addressed promptly and effectively.
4. CKD: The patient's CKD may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's DM may lead to hypoglycemia if not managed properly, particularly if the patient is not eating or is experiencing excessive insulin sensitivity.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay may increase the risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and OSA may increase the risk of developing pneumonia, particularly if not treated promptly and effectively.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of hypertension and CKD may increase the risk of developing DVT, particularly if not treated with prophylactic anticoagulation.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from her obesity, OSA, and COPD. She requires continued NIV and titration of BIPAP settings for optimal ventilation. Her atrial fibrillation requires continued rate control with metoprolol, and consideration of adding esmolol for further rate control. Her altered mental status may be related to delirium and requires gentle reorientation and continued monitoring. Her CKD requires continued monitoring of I/Os and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Her DM requires continued management with a diabetic diet and HISS."
