You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac arrest. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, and an arterial line was inserted. He is currently receiving sedation, analgesia, and paralytics. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 33.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 400. His physical examination reveals a soft abdomen, no chest wall deformities, and no femoral bruits.

Assessment:

The patient's cardiac arrest is not related to active acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and his troponin level is elevated. He has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) on bedside echocardiogram, which may be due to cardiac stunning. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. His neurologic function is limited, with absent corneal reflexes, but he opens his eyes to name calling.

Plan:

1. Cardiac: Start beta-blocker and uptitrate as tolerated, and perform a bedside echocardiogram in the morning. Consider cardiac catheterization on Monday.
2. Rhythm: Start beta-blocker and increase as tolerated. If there is evidence of neurologic recovery, consider electrophysiology consult for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.
3. Cardiac arrest: Continue cooling protocol for 18-24 hours, and wean sedation and ventilation as tolerated.
4. HTN: Start beta-blocker and continue hypertension medications.
5. Prophylaxis: Administer heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and manage pain with fentanyl and midazolam.
6. Nutrition: Provide insulin per ICU care and maintain glycemic control.
7. Lines: Monitor arterial line and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.
8. Prophylaxis: Continue stress ulcer and VAP prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac: Cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Neurologic: Seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and neurologic deterioration.
3. Respiratory: Respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory acidosis.
4. Hematologic: Bleeding complications, coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Infection: Sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
6. Metabolic: Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting.
8. Skin: Pressure ulcers, skin breakdown, and skin infections."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to polymorphic VT, which may be caused by ischemia. The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG, and syncope s/p PPM. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a temporary pacing wire in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. His respiratory support includes CMV/ASSIST ventilation with a set rate of 16 and a tidal volume of 600 mL.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a paralyzed and sedated state, with no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis. His lungs are clear, with no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no signs of ascites or abdominal bruits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated CK and troponin levels, likely due to the cardiac arrest and subsequent shocks. His INR is elevated at 2.4, and his WBC count is 13.4 K/uL. His preliminary Echo read shows severely depressed LV and RV function with biatrial enlargement, MR, and AS.

The patient's plan includes continued cooling protocol, paralytics to reduce shivering, and sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. He will also receive ventilatory support and weaning as tolerated following cooling. A neuro evaluation will be performed once cooling is complete and sedation is weaned.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Pneumonia
3. Respiratory failure
4. Cardiac arrhythmias
5. Stroke or TIA due to hypoperfusion or embolism
6. Myocardial infarction or infarction of the graft
7. Septic shock or sepsis
8. Renal failure or acute kidney injury
9. Hepatic failure or liver dysfunction
10. Neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema, due to hypoxia or ischemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. is currently cooled, started warming at 4am on [**11-30**].  Was
   normotensive yest. until received home doses of Lisinopril and HCTZ and
   then never recovered w/ BPs in 80-90s.  Was given total of 750cc
   boluses w/ mild improvement in SBPs.  Started on [**12-18**] maintenance IVF,
   50cc/hr as ECHO was done showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and
   diastolic.  Had some desats into 50s reqiuring increasing PEEP
   and FiO2, but is weaned back to PEEP of 8 and FiO2 of 50%.  EP will see
   pt on Sunday for ICD eval.  SBPs dipped to 60s ON, started on Dopamine
   @ 5mcg/kg/min and received 250cc/IVF, no signs of pulm ed. on exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on the
   list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Completed cooling 24 hrs and now warming, paralytics off.
   - Will monitor for hyperkalemia and tx w/ [**Last Name (LF) 2857**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold off on
   lasix given no clinical HF
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation, will need to wean to assess
   neuro status.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. Now w/ possible ischemic
   changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and
   shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2, thus
   managed well from medical stand point.
   - full dose aspirin
   - holding BBk [**1-18**] hypotension.
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, INR therapeutic, holding
   coumadin.
   - will likely need cath on Monday
   - F/u oncoronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # PUMP:  showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not
   clinically in failure.
   -          Holding bbk, ACEI
   -          IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will
   monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   -          Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus conduction and TwI.  DDx
   includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old male, is currently in the ICU following a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is on anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), but the exact etiology is still unclear.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Temperature: 36°C (normal range: 36.5-37.5°C)
* Blood pressure: 111/54 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Heart rate: 80-85 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths/min (normal range: 12-20 breaths/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Electrocardiogram (ECG): shows atrial fibrillation (AF) with inferior-apical twave inversion (TwI)
* Chest X-ray (CXR): shows no pulmonary edema or consolidation
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC): 13.4 K/uL (normal range: 4-11 K/uL)
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.5 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
	+ Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
	+ Troponin-T: 0.34 ng/mL (normal range: <0.1 ng/mL)

The patient is currently receiving:

* Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O
* Dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure
* Fentanyl infusion at 50 mcg/hour for pain management
* Midazolam infusion at an unknown dose for sedation
* Lasix hold due to no clinical signs of heart failure
* Aspirin 325 mg daily for antiplatelet therapy
* Coumadin hold due to cardiac arrest

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of CAD and previous cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of recurrent arrhythmias.
2. Heart failure: Despite the patient's EF of 15-20%, he is still at risk of developing heart failure due to his underlying CAD and toxic/metabolic causes.
3. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's history of CAD and previous cardiac arrest, there is a risk of developing pulmonary edema, especially if his blood pressure is not well-controlled.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion may have caused neurological damage, which could lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, or even death.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase his risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.
2. Wean the patient off dopamine and fentanyl as tolerated to assess his neurological status.
3. Perform a neurological exam, including a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assessment, post-warming and at 72 hours.
4. Consider ordering an electroencephalogram (EEG) and neurology consultation if the patient's neurological status worsens.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid status and blood pressure to prevent pulmonary edema and heart failure.
6. Continue anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin once the patient's cardiac status stabilizes.
7. Consider ordering a cardiac catheterization to assess the patient's coronary anatomy and potential blockages.
8. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
9. Provide stress ulcer prophylaxis and bowel regimen as per ICU protocol.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and provide updates on his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. is currently cooled, started warming at 4am on [**11-30**].  Was
   normotensive yest. until received home doses of Lisinopril and HCTZ and
   then never recovered w/ BPs in 80-90s.  Was given total of 750cc
   boluses w/ mild improvement in SBPs.  Started on [**12-18**] maintenance IVF,
   50cc/hr as ECHO was done showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and
   diastolic.  Had some desats into 50s reqiuring increasing PEEP
   and FiO2, but is weaned back to PEEP of 8 and FiO2 of 50%.  EP will see
   pt on Sunday for ICD eval.  SBPs dipped to 60s ON, started on Dopamine
   @ 5mcg/kg/min and received 250cc/IVF, no signs of pulm ed. on exam.
   SBP rebounded to 100s w/ MAP in high 60s to low 70s.  Discussed code
   status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about neurological
   status.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, and AF. He presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications. Some of the key issues include:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by polymorphic VT. The differential diagnosis includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia. The patient has an 11-year-old graft, which may no longer be patent.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and no ischemic changes were seen on the EKG, although the interpretation is limited due to V pacing.
3. Reduced Ejection Fraction: The patient's preliminary TTE shows severely reduced EF, but he is not clinically in heart failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and is currently receiving Metoprolol, HCTZ, and Lisinopril as per his home doses.
5. Neurological Status: The patient has limited neurological function off sedation, with absent corneal reflexes on exam, but did open his eyes to name calling prior to paralytic use.
6. Respiratory Status: The patient is intubated and receiving ventilatory support, with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
7. Fluid Status: The patient has received a total of 2,430 mL of fluids, with a net balance of 1,035 mL.
8. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, and chloride level of 102 mEq/L.

Some potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AF and recent cardiac arrest make him at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Heart failure: The patient's reduced EF and history of CAD make him at risk for heart failure.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's limited neurological function and history of cardiac arrest make him at risk for further neurological deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and ventilatory support make him at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and use of invasive lines and devices make him at risk for infection.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and use of vasoactive medications make him at risk for hemodynamic instability.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.  The
   patient has had high residuals so his medications have been changed to
   PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.  The propofol
   was increased due to his tachypnea and his MAPs started dropping to the
   high 40
s to low 50
s.  He was given two 250 cc boluses of NS.  He was
   started empirically on vanc and zosyn.  He was also started on levophed
   to augment his pressures as his dopamine is at 12 mcg/kg/min and he had
   a 7 beat run of nonsustained Vtach on tele.

   and Moderate MR.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.  Levophed was added this am as he became to develop ectopy on
   higher doses of dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data
   -  Consider placing a Swan [**Last Name (un) **] to differentiate between cardiogenic
   shock and distributive shock.
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI on EKG, an ischemic
   event higher on the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1,
   so picture still unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police
   records, but still unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx
   for TwI could also represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.
   Preliminary review from pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this
   is difficult to tell from strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which
   may no longer be patent.  Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances,
   hypothermia, PE) less likely.
   -  Will need Neuro assessment off sedation today
   -  Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but it
   has been held since he was admitted.  Given his elevated coags and
   possible sepsis, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support and antibiotics as
   above to treat probable spesis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at 50cc of D5NS for maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but
   will monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery, will f/u EP
   recs.
   - holding coumadin given elevated INR.
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care;
   - Will start reglan today as the patient has been having high
   residuals.  Once his residuals start decreasing, will start tube feeds.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feed recs.

   dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on
   a background of prior inferior myocardial infarction"" w/ significant AS
   and Moderate MR.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.  Levophed was added this am as he became to develop ectopy on
   higher doses of dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data
   -  Consider placing a Swan [**Last Name (un) **] to differentiate between cardiogenic
   shock and distributive shock.
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI on EKG, an ischemic
   event higher on the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1,
   so picture still unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police
   records, but still unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx
   for TwI could also represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.
   Preliminary review from pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this
   is difficult to tell from strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which
   may no longer be patent.  Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances,
   hypothermia, PE) less likely.
   -  Will need Neuro assessment off sedation today
   -  Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but it
   has been held since he was admitted.  Given his elevated coags and
   possible sepsis, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support and antibiotics as
   above to treat probable spesis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at 50cc of D5NS for maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but
   will monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery, will f/u EP
   recs.
   - holding coumadin given elevated INR.
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care;
   - Will start reglan today as the patient has been having high
   residuals.  Once his residuals start decreasing, will start tube feeds.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feed recs.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. He was cooled and then warmed after cardiac arrest and is currently intubated and on a ventilator. He has been experiencing hypotension, fever, and tachypnea, and has been started on dopamine and levophed to support his blood pressure. He has also been started on antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachypnea, and fever are consistent with sepsis. He has been started on antibiotics, but the patient's condition should be closely monitored for signs of worsening sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. He has been started on dopamine and levophed to support his blood pressure, but the patient's condition should be closely monitored for signs of worsening shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's increased creatinine level suggests the possibility of acute renal failure. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function, and diuretics and dialysis should be considered if necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and PTT suggest the possibility of coagulopathy. He should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and platelet transfusions should be considered if necessary.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypothermia may have caused neurologic damage. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening neurologic function, and neurology consultation should be considered.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and tachypnea suggest the possibility of infection. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening infection, and antibiotics should be adjusted as necessary.
7. Ischemic changes: The patient's EKG changes suggest the possibility of ischemic changes. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening ischemia, and cardiac catheterization should be considered if necessary.

Plan:

1. Continue dopamine and levophed to support the patient's blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and consider diuretics and dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's INR and PTT and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's neurologic function and consider neurology consultation if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's infection and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
7. Consider cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease.
8. Consider a nutrition consult to evaluate the patient's nutritional needs and plan for tube feeding.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider ICD placement if necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on the
   list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still

   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Completed cooling 24 hrs and now warming, paralytics off.
   - Will monitor for hyperkalemia and tx w/ [**Last Name (LF) 2857**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold off on
   lasix given no clinical HF
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation, will need to wean to assess
   neuro status.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. Now w/ possible ischemic
   changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and
   shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2, thus
   managed well from medical stand point.
   - full dose aspirin
   - holding BBk [**1-18**] hypotension.
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, INR therapeutic, holding
   coumadin.
   - will likely need cath on Monday
   - F/u oncoronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # PUMP:  showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not
   clinically in failure.
   -          Holding bbk, ACEI
   -          IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will
   monitor for clinical signs of HF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  Differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar
   tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on the
   list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Completed cooling 24 hrs and now warming, paralytics off.
   - Will monitor for hyperkalemia and tx w/ [**Last Name (LF) 2857**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold off on
   lasix given no clinical HF
   - continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation, will need to wean to assess
   neuro status.
   - ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with history of CAD. Now w/ possible ischemic
   changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and
   shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2, thus
   managed well from medical stand point.
   - full dose aspirin
   - holding BBk [**1-18**] hypotension.
   - already anticoagulated on coumadin, INR therapeutic, holding
   coumadin.
   - will likely need cath on Monday
   - F/u oncoronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # PUMP:  showing EF 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not
   clinically in failure.
   -          Holding bbk, ACEI
   -          IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will
   monitor for clinical signs of HF.
   -          Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: PPM interrogations likely with VF.  Patient received 2 shocks
   from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus conduction and TwI.  DDx
   includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin with possible catherization
   .
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive..
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril as per home doses
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care
   ACCESS: PIVs and A-line
   PROPHYLAXIS:

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He also has a permanent pacemaker (PPM) and has experienced atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient was warmed after cooling and is currently normothermic and off sedation.

The patient's cardiac function is severely impaired, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. He has significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely due to CAD superimposed by toxic or metabolic causes. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with dopamine and IV fluids, and he is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin.

The patient's neurological status is impaired, with no response to voice or commands. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood work shows elevated lactate levels, which may indicate a metabolic or toxic process.

The patient has a high risk of developing complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of AF and the presence of a PPM, there is a risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's current neurological status is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly given his immunosuppressed state and the presence of central lines.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's blood work shows elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of developing respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and fever may indicate the presence of sepsis.

Based on the patient's current condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Perform a neurological examination to assess the patient's neurological status and potential for recovery.
3. Monitor the patient's blood work for signs of infection, bleeding, or renal failure.
4. Consider performing an electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess the patient's brain activity and potential for recovery.
5. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust therapy as necessary to manage the patient's respiratory status.
6. Consider performing a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head to assess for any potential intracranial injuries or bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine gtt as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Hold off on empiric antibiotics for now.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He was warmed after cooling and is currently on a ventilator due to cardiac arrest. He is sedated and unresponsive, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure of 153/107 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to a combination of factors, including ischemia, prior myocardial infarction, and scar tissue. He has a 11-year-old graft that may no longer be patent, and his cardiac catheterization may reveal underlying coronary disease.

The patient's current medications include dopamine, propofol, and heparin. He is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains dependent on dopamine, and he may require further management to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.8°F, and he may be at risk for infection, atelectasis, or other complications.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's AF may persist, and he may require further management to control his heart rhythm.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and unresponsiveness may be due to his cardiac arrest or other underlying neurological conditions. He may require further evaluation and management to assess his neurological status.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and panculturing may indicate an infection, which could lead to sepsis or other complications.
6. Coronary Disease: The patient's history of CAD and previous cardiac arrest may indicate underlying coronary disease, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
7. Hypoxia: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis may indicate hypoxia, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which could lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue dopamine and propofol as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and sedation.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature and respiratory status closely, and consider further management if necessary.
3. Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate the patient's coronary anatomy and treat underlying coronary disease.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
5. Consider placing a Swan-Ganz catheter or performing a right heart catheterization to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and adjust his medications as necessary.
7. Consider a neurology consultation to assess the patient's neurological status and potential for recovery.
8. Consider a repeat echocardiogram to assess the patient's cardiac function and potential for further cardiac complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities; however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.  The propofol
   was increased due to his tachypnea and his MAPs started dropping to the
   high 40
s to low 50
s.  He was given two 250 cc boluses of NS.  He was
   started empirically on vanc and zosyn.  He was also started on levophed
   to augment his pressures as his dopamine is at 12 mcg/kg/min and he had
   a 7 beat run of nonsustained Vtach on tele.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG at 72hrs
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but has
   been off it since admitted.  Given his elevated coags and possible
   sepsis given his hypotension, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - EEG at 72hrs
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine and levophed gtts as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am and started
   empirically on vanc and zosyn given his fever and persistent
   hypotension.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  His lines will need to be pulled and replaced.
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but has
   been off it since admitted.  Given his elevated coags and possible
   sepsis given his hypotension, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing
   - F/U EP consult recs.
   - holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation (AF). He was cooled and then warmed after cardiac arrest, and is currently intubated and sedated. His vital signs are stable, but he is still obtunded and does not follow commands. He has been started on dopamine and levophed infusions to support his blood pressure, and has been empirically treated with vancomycin and zosyn for potential infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may have been caused by ischemia, memory T-wave, or anoxic brain injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by neurologic shock, cardiogenic shock, or septic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Fever: The patient's fever may be caused by infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Elevated Coags: The patient's elevated INR and PTT may be caused by DIC, which is a concern given his sepsis and hypotension.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine may be caused by renal hypoperfusion, which is a concern given his multiple episodes of hypotension.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG may be contributing to his cardiac arrest and hypotension.
7. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's TTE showed an EF of 15-20% with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, which may be contributing to his cardiac arrest and hypotension.
8. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of atrial fibrillation may be contributing to his cardiac arrest and hypotension.
9. Neurologic Complications: The patient's obtundation and lack of response to voice may be caused by anoxic brain injury or other neurologic complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue dopamine and levophed infusions to support blood pressure.
2. F/u on culture data to check for infection.
3. Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
4. Continue vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage.
5. F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
6. Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
7. F/u on coronary anatomy with previous CABG records.
8. Consult neurology to assess his neurologic status and chance of recovery.
9. Wean propofol.
10. Consider an ICD placement if he has evidence of neurologic recovery.
11. F/u EP consult recs.
12. Holding coumadin given the possibility of cardiac catheterization.
13. Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives).
14. FEN: NPO for now, insulin per ICU care.
15. ACCESS: PIVs and A-line.
16. PROPHYLAXIS: DVT ppx w/ sc heparin, pain management with tylenol, bowel regimen."

   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   warming and at 72h
   - EEG at 72hrs and Neurology consultation prn.
   - Neuro exam to clear spine, if not possible, may need MRI of head (pt
   w/ hardware of unknown material in UE)
   # HYPOTENSION:  The patient became hypotensive the day of admission
   after receiving his home BP medications.  He responded initially to
   fluids, however his SBPs began to fall to the 60
s so he was started on
   dopamine.  Yesterday as he was warming he had another episode of
   hypotension to the 50
s which responded to increased dopamine.  His
   pressures remain dependent on dopamine.  The differential for his
   hypotension includes neurologic shock vs cardiogenic shock vs septic
   shock.
   -  Continue dopamine gtt as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   -  F/u on culture data to check for infection.
   -  Consider placing a Swan or doing a right heart cath while at cardiac
   cath to differentiate between cardiogenic shock and distributive shock.
   # FEVER:  The patient spiked to 101.8 this am and became tachypenic
   likely in response to his fever.  The differential for his fever
   includes infection, atelectasis, PE, or medication effect.  Most likely
   this represents infection.  Patient was pancultured this am.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Hold off on empiric antibiotics for now.
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  The patient
s INR was elevated to4.6 this am (from
   2.5) and his Ptt is 64.5.  The patient is on coumadin at home, but has
   been off it since admitted.  Given his elevated coags and possible
   sepsis given his hypotension, this is concerning for DIC.
   -  Will check fibrinogen, D-Dimer, FDP, and recheck his coags.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.4 (from 1.2
   yesterday), but had been as low as 0.8 during this admission.  His
   increased Cr is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his
   multiple episodes of hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.   LDL 49 and Total Chol 102, HDL 30, at goal.  A1c 6.2,
   thus managed well from medical stand point.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic
   disease which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **] (waiting for
   the office to open on Monday).
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - IVF at maintenance and bolus to maintain BPs, but will monitor for
   clinical signs of HF.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2858**] to assess for baseline EF and HF.
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  Patient currently in AF w/ sinus
   conduction and TwI.  DDx includes ischemia, memory Tw, CNS anoxic
   injury.
   - if has evidence of neurologic recovery, ICD placement, EP is seeing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was warmed yesterday am starting at 4 am and was completely
   normothermic (and off sedation) by midmorning.  The patient continued
   on a dopamine gtt of 9 mcg/kg/hr (started [**11-29**] at night given
   hypotension). TTE on [**11-29**] showed an EF of 15-20% with severe
   systolic and diastolic dysfunction ""suggestive of a global process
   (toxic, metabolic, etc.) on a background of prior inferior myocardial
   infarction"" w/ significant AS and Moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] discuss possibly
   doing a cath today given the possibility of ischemic origin of his
   arrhythmia.  As the patient is still obtunded on the vent, EP eval
   deferred until Monday.  Will also consult neuro on Monday for
   evaluation as he will be approaching 72 hrs of his event by then.
   Discussed code status w/ family, FULL code until we know more about
   neurological status.  The patient currently opens his eyes to voice and
   spontaneously moves all extremities, however he does not follow
   commands.  The patient has had high residuals so his medications have
   been changed to PR/IV if possible.
   He began to wake up around 4 am and was fighting the ventilator and
   biting down on the tube so he was started on a propofol drip.  He
   spiked to 101.8 around 5am and became tachypneic with a respiratory
   alkalosis on ABG.  He was pancultured and given tylenol.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Given new TwI ischemic event higher on
   the list, but CKs peaked at 260s and troponins at 0.1, so picture still
   unclear.  Pt. underwent CPR, as confirmed per police records, but still
   unclear for how long he was w/o rhythm and CPR.  DDx for TwI could also
   represent memory Tw or anoxic brain injury.   Preliminary review from
   pacer, appears to be polymorphic VT, but this is difficult to tell from
   strip.  Patient has 11 year old graft which may no longer be patent.
   Other etiologies (electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia, PE) less
   likely.
   Will need Neuro assessment off sedation, including GCS @ 48hrs post
   arrest and 72hrs.  If no papillary/corneal reflexes and no motor
   response to pain, prognosis likely very poor.  If + pupils/corneal/pain
   response, may need neuro consult for further eval.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**],
   Neurology contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Wean propofol
   - Consult neurology today to assess his neurologic status and chance of
   recovery.
   - Ventilatory support and wean as tolerated following warming
   - Patient will require neurological exam including GCS assessment post
   warming and at 72h

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with cardiac arrest and was subsequently cooled and rewarmed. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and his vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.8°C (101.8°F)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm
* Blood pressure: 153/107 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's cardiac arrest is attributed to a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was preceded by ventricular fibrillation (VF). The differential diagnosis for the cardiac arrest includes ischemia, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and scar tissue causing arrhythmia.

The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He has a 11-year-old graft that may no longer be patent. The patient's current cardiac status is characterized by severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6-7.3 x 10^9/L

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Fevers down during the day but then respiked to 101.6 at 5am.  Seen by
   neuro and EP.  EP will put in ICD prior to discharge depending on
   prognosis and clinical picture.  Neuro wanted repeat head and neck CT.
   Ordered but patient too unstable to transport.  Levophed weaned off,
   Dopa weaned to 9.  Reglan started for high residuals.  Nutrition c/s
   done.  Clamped ng tube at 4:30pm and no residuals.  DIC labs checked.
   Propofol was turned off for neuro exam at 2:30, turned back on at
   8:30pm for agitation.  While off propofol was following commands,
   opening eyes to voice.  Blood cx's positive for GNRs in [**1-20**] bottles (1
   set from groin line).  Attempted to wean from ventilator but RSBIs poor
   in the morning (RR up to 40) when PS weaned.  Now on 14/5.  Also having
   thick tan secretions.  Started on tube feeds.

   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Fevers down during the day but then respiked to 101.6 at 5am.  Seen by
   neuro and EP.  EP will put in ICD prior to discharge depending on
   prognosis and clinical picture.  Neuro wanted repeat head and neck CT.
   Ordered but patient too unstable to transport.  Levophed weaned off,
   Dopa weaned to 9.  Reglan started for high residuals.  Nutrition c/s
   done.  Clamped ng tube at 4:30pm and no residuals.  DIC labs checked.
   Propofol was turned off for neuro exam at 2:30, turned back on at
   8:30pm for agitation.  While off propofol was following commands,
   opening eyes to voice.  Blood cx's positive for GNRs in [**1-20**] bottles (1

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Fevers down during the day but then respiked to 101.6 at 5am.  Seen by
   neuro and EP.  EP will put in ICD prior to discharge depending on
   prognosis and clinical picture.  Neuro wanted repeat head and neck CT.
   Ordered but patient too unstable to transport.  Levophed weaned off,
   Dopa weaned to 9.  Reglan started for high residuals.  Nutrition c/s
   done.  Clamped ng tube at 4:30pm and no residuals.  DIC labs checked.
   Propofol was turned off for neuro exam at 2:30, turned back on at
   8:30pm for agitation.  While off propofol was following commands,
   opening eyes to voice.  Blood cx's positive for GNRs in [**1-20**] bottles (1
   set from groin line).  Attempted to wean from ventilator but RSBIs poor
   in the morning (RR up to 40) when PS weaned.  Now on 14/5.  Also having

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # HYPOTENSION:  Likely a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock,
   now with GNRs in the blood from the femoral line.  Pt was started on
   Levophed yesterday which is now weaned off, continues to require
   dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   - vanc and zosyn for broad spectrum abxs
   -  Continue drawing daily blood cultures
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  Tm today 101.6.  Blood cultures redrawn from peripheral and
   a-line.  Femoral line with GNRs will need to be removed today.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  remove femoral groin line and consider subclavian for access
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - unable to clear c-spine clinically; not able to obtain MRI due to
   pacemaker
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.
   -  continue to trend coags and monitor for bleeding
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Fevers down during the day but then respiked to 101.6 at 5am.  Seen by
   neuro and EP.  EP will put in ICD prior to discharge depending on
   prognosis and clinical picture.  Neuro wanted repeat head and neck CT.
   Ordered but patient too unstable to transport.  Levophed weaned off,
   Dopa weaned to 9.  Reglan started for high residuals.  Nutrition c/s
   done.  Clamped ng tube at 4:30pm and no residuals.  DIC labs checked.
   Propofol was turned off for neuro exam at 2:30, turned back on at
   8:30pm for agitation.  While off propofol was following commands,
   opening eyes to voice.  Blood cx's positive for GNRs in [**1-20**] bottles (1
   set from groin line).  Attempted to wean from ventilator but RSBIs poor
   in the morning (RR up to 40) when PS weaned.  Now on 14/5.  Also having
   thick tan secretions.  Started on tube feeds.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # HYPOTENSION:  Likely a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock,
   now with GNRs in the blood from the femoral line.  Pt was started on
   Levophed yesterday which is now weaned off, continues to require
   dopamine.
   -  Continue dopamine as needed to keep his MAPs > 60.
   - vanc and zosyn for broad spectrum abxs
   -  Continue drawing daily blood cultures
   - Will continue ventilatory support given concern for sepsis.
   # FEVER:  Tm today 101.6.  Blood cultures redrawn from peripheral and
   a-line.  Femoral line with GNRs will need to be removed today.
   -  F/u BCx, UCx, UA, sputum Cx.
   -  Continue vanc and zosyn for broad coverage.
   -  remove femoral groin line and consider subclavian for access
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - unable to clear c-spine clinically; not able to obtain MRI due to
   pacemaker
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.
   -  continue to trend coags and monitor for bleeding
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD. Now w/ possible
   ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT,
   CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   - F/u on coronary anatomy w/ previous CABG records at [**Hospital1 **].
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Not clinically in
   failure.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor for signs of failure
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and raglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prior cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation. He is on dopamine for blood pressure support and has a femoral line with GNRs in the blood.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer, indicating sepsis. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has a history of CAD. His kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and acute renal failure. He is at risk for bleeding due to his coagulopathy and has a history of hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of CAD increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and femoral line increase his risk of bleeding complications, including hematoma formation and bleeding into vital organs.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's impaired kidney function and history of CAD increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of CAD and cardiac arrest increase his risk of developing cardiac failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and death.

Based on the patient's current condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue dopamine for blood pressure support and monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiac rhythm.
2. Continue antibiotic therapy for sepsis and monitor the patient's laboratory results for signs of infection.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk and consider transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma if necessary.
5. Consider cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease, which could be the underlying trigger for the patient's cardiac arrest.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider placing an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider weaning him from mechanical ventilation if possible.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider tube feeding if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's pain and consider pain management with medications and other interventions as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including anoxic brain damage, respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrest, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and is receiving dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.5-8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0-29.2 g/dL, platelet count of 104-131 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.2-1.4 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) head and neck, are negative for any significant abnormalities.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cardiac arrest, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, dopamine and norepinephrine infusions, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient will also require close monitoring of their electrolyte levels and hemodynamic status.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, altered mental status, and positive blood cultures, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing further respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac tamponade.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's anoxic brain damage increases the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or brain edema.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and bloody secretions increase the risk of developing infection.

In conclusion, this patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications."

   Microboiology:
   Blood Cx's positive for Pseudomonas in [**1-20**] bottles (1 set from groin
   line [**12-1**]), susceptible to Zosyn, Cipro, Ceftaz.
   Peripheral BCx negative since [**12-1**] to date
   Sputum [**12-2**]: GPC in clusters/pairs 4+, 1+ GNR.
   CXR [**12-3**]:
   In comparison with the study of [**12-2**], the various support and
   monitoring devices remain in place. Enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette is
   again seen. The opacification at the right base appears to be clearing.
   On
   the left, there is persistent opacification consistent with some
   combination
   of atelectasis, effusion and superimposed consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted with cardiac arrest, sepsis, and VAP. He has a history of CAD, syncope, and AF. He was cooled and rewarmed, and Pseudomonas sepsis was diagnosed. He is currently on Levophed, Zosyn, and Vancomycin. His vital signs are stable, with a MAP of 60 and a CVP of 10. His respiratory status is improving, with a SpO2 of 97% and a RSBI of 80. His neurological examination is indicative of good prognosis, but his prognosis is still guarded.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of Levophed and Zosyn is a good start, but the patient may require additional antibiotics and supportive care.
2. VAP: The patient's VAP is likely to persist if not properly treated. The use of Vancomycin is a good start, but the patient may require additional antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely to recur if not properly managed. The use of Levophed and Zosyn is a good start, but the patient may require additional medications and supportive care.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of CPAP and pressure support is a good start, but the patient may require additional respiratory support and therapy.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of FFP and renally-dosed medications is a good start, but the patient may require additional supportive care and therapy.
6. CAD: The patient's CAD is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of aspirin and holding his B-blocker is a good start, but the patient may require additional medications and supportive care.
7. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of Lasix and holding his home B-blocker and ACEI is a good start, but the patient may require additional supportive care and therapy.
8. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is likely to worsen if not properly managed. The use of coumadin and holding his PPM is a good start, but the patient may require additional medications and supportive care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and VAP with Levophed, Zosyn, and Vancomycin.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac arrest with Levophed and Zosyn.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with CPAP and pressure support.
5. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with FFP and renally-dosed medications.
6. Continue to manage the patient's CAD with aspirin and holding his B-blocker.
7. Continue to manage the patient's congestive heart failure with Lasix and holding his home B-blocker and ACEI.
8. Continue to manage the patient's rhythm with coumadin and holding his PPM.

Note: The patient's prognosis is still guarded, and the patient may require additional supportive care and therapy to recover from his current condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with continued
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of hypotension and fevers, now with GNRs in
   blood.  Although echo shows poor EF, extremities are warm,
   extravascular edema suggest distributive shock process.
   - will switch Dopamine to Levophed for better peripheral
   vasoconstriction to augment hypotension
   - treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, Zosyn for 14 days after line
   pulled (likely pulled tomorrow); Vanco for 48 more hours until cultures
   negative.
   - will treat coagulopathy with 5mg Vitamin K today to bring INR down in
   order to replace the line
   - pt appears adequately fluid-resuscitated, will hold off on IVF today
   - continue surveillance cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible
   VAP given fevers and secretion.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension and try to run even;
   consider lasix when BP improves
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is reassuring;
   however prognosis still guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - head and c-spine CT today to evaluate for interval change (negative
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Location (un) 103**] at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital)
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down but INR 2.9 today and PTT 69.
   Pt is on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.
   DIC labs checked with elevated fibrinogen of 847, FDP 0-10, d-dimer
   slightly up at 621.  HIT is low on differential given short time course
   of thrombocytopenia
   -  vitamin K today; continue to monitor
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Improving to 1.3 today.  His increased Cr is
   likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion given his multiple episodes of
   hypotension.
   -  Will continue pressors as above for BP support
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin for now given that his arrest could be
   secondary to an ischemic event.
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis is recovered to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   - continue to monitor pulmonary edema and consider diuresis when off
   pressors
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin and heparin given elevated INR
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following:

1. The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope, and PPM, who presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU.
2. The patient has been treated with cooling and rewarming, and is now on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
3. The patient has developed sepsis, likely due to GNRs in the blood, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. The patient has respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and possible VAP, and is being treated with diuresis and pressors.
5. The patient has cardiac arrest, and the differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia.
6. The patient has elevated coags, including INR 2.9 and PTT 69, and is being treated with vitamin K.
7. The patient has acute renal failure, and his creatinine is improving, but is still elevated.
8. The patient has a history of CAD, and his cardiac catheterization showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3, and TO of RCA.
9. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, and has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely to recur if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. CAD: The patient's CAD is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations for further management include:

1. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory failure with diuresis and pressors.
3. Continue to treat the patient's cardiac arrest with cardioversion and ICD placement.
4. Continue to treat the patient's coagulopathy with vitamin K and heparin.
5. Continue to treat the patient's acute renal failure with diuresis and pressors.
6. Continue to treat the patient's CAD with aspirin and statins.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion and ICD placement.

I recommend that the patient be closely monitored and treated promptly and effectively to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   Left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation might represent combination
   of infection/atelectasis. Aspiration is another possibility.
   Improvement of the aeration of the perihilar areas and right lower
   lung, most
   likely due to resolution of pulmonary edema or aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Improvement of the aeration of the perihilar areas and right lower

   likely due to resolution of pulmonary edema or aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has undergone cooling and rewarming and is now on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a pressure support of 15 cmH2O.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Pseudomonas and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's temperature has been elevated, and there is concern about the development of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, but there is concern about the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the patient's history of AF and the presence of secretions in the sputum.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was preceded by ventricular fibrillation (VF), and there is concern about the development of further arrhythmias.
4. Elevated coags: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.9, and there is concern about the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is concern about the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is at risk for further ischemic events.
7. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is at risk for further deterioration.
8. Rhythm: The patient is currently in AF and has a history of AF, and there is concern about the development of further arrhythmias.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is a plan to continue surveillance cultures from the periphery.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated with CPAP and is being monitored for signs of VAP.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient is being monitored for signs of further arrhythmias, and there is a plan to consider ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery.
4. Elevated coags: The patient is being treated with FFP, and there is a plan to restart coumadin once the IJ line is placed and the femoral line is removed.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient is being monitored for signs of further deterioration, and there is a plan to continue to trend creatinine levels and avoid nephrotoxins.
6. CAD: The patient is being monitored for signs of further ischemic events, and there is a plan to consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease.
7. Congestive heart failure: The patient is being monitored for signs of further deterioration, and there is a plan to consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia once sepsis resolves.
8. Rhythm: The patient is being monitored for signs of further arrhythmias, and there is a plan to consider ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a
   ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient continues on levophed and on the ventilator.  His pressure
   support was increased to 15 this am and he was eventually changed over
   to AC with PEEP of 5 voleume of 500 RR 12 and FiO2 40% in the
   afternoon.  His INR was 1.9 so he was given 2 units of FFP and a right
   IJ was placed, with difficulty.  His groin line was pulled and the cath
   tip was sent for cx.  No new recs from neuro.  EP had no new recs, will
   continue to follow.  Pt. off coumadin for now.

   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he may require intubation and mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to ischemia or prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing further arrhythmias.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high risk of developing coagulopathy due to his history of CAD and the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a high risk of developing acute renal failure due to his history of CAD and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a high risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, due to his cardiac arrest and the use of sedative medications.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, due to his immunocompromised state and the use of invasive medical devices.

Assessment and plan:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis will be managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored, and he will be intubated and mechanically ventilated as necessary.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest will be managed with cardioversion and antiarrhythmic medications as necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy will be managed with anticoagulant medications and close monitoring of his coagulation studies.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure will be managed with supportive care and close monitoring of his renal function.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological complications will be managed with close monitoring and supportive care.
7. Infection: The patient's infection will be managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn and will add Tobramycin for double coverage of
   Pseudomonas sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of
   line removal, total 14d.
   - Vancomycin for GPC in clusters suggestive of S. aureus in sputum.
   ABx started on [**12-1**], total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Repeat UCx give spike.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx.  Large Aa gradient,
   PaO2/FiO2
 265, thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG suggestive of mixed respiratory and
   metabolic alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, despite increased
   pressure support.  Possible Cheyene
s [**Doctor Last Name 2022**] resp observed by
   respiratory suggestive of CNS etiology in addition to sepsis. Must
   improve resp. status significantly prior to attempted extubation.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and PEEP of 5
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.4.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Will start Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday, baseline TFTs
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Will restart coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.4 (1.2 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   - U/A sediment examination ordered
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin

   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Improvement of the aeration of the perihilar areas and right lower
   lung, most
   likely due to resolution of pulmonary edema or aspiration.
   EEG
 consistent w/ encephalopathy, no focal areas of epileptiform
   discharges.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn and will add Tobramycin for double coverage of
   Pseudomonas sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of
   line removal, total 14d.
   - Vancomycin for GPC in clusters suggestive of S. aureus in sputum.
   ABx started on [**12-1**], total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Repeat UCx give spike.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx.  Large Aa gradient,
   PaO2/FiO2
 265, thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG suggestive of mixed respiratory and
   metabolic alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, despite increased
   pressure support.  Possible Cheyene
s [**Doctor Last Name 2022**] resp observed by
   respiratory suggestive of CNS etiology in addition to sepsis. Must
   improve resp. status significantly prior to attempted extubation.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and PEEP of 5
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.4.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Will start Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday, baseline TFTs
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Will restart coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.4 (1.2 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   - U/A sediment examination ordered
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.
   -          Retic count
   -          QD HCT, will recheck this afternoon.
   -          Fe studies, B12, Folate, TSH
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs consistently above 150.
   -          Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, A-line (inserted [**11-28**]), RIJ ([**2194-12-3**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, specifically Pseudomonas sepsis, and is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.6°F
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 111/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.9 cells/μL
* Platelet count: 119 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): 144 pg/mL
* Troponin I: 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 191 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows a left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation, which may represent a combination of infection and atelectasis. The patient's electroencephalogram (EEG) is consistent with encephalopathy, and his neurological examination is off propofol.

The patient's plan includes:

* Treating sepsis with antibiotics
* Managing respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Monitoring cardiac arrest with cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Managing acute renal failure with fluid management and medication adjustments
* Considering cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease
* Managing anemia with blood transfusions and iron supplements
* Managing hyperglycemia with insulin therapy
* Providing pain management with analgesics and sedatives
* Monitoring for and treating potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Acute kidney injury
* Anemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypotension
* Hypoxia
* Cardiac arrest
* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line, Pulmonary
   w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in edema esp. in UEs.
   Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.  All this is
   suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8-10
   with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Will remove
   line today.
   - On  Levophed, will wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ Zosyn for Pseudomonas and Vancomycin for GPC in clusters
   suggestive of S. aureus.   ABx started on [**12-1**], but will treat today
   as day 1, as will pull femoral line.
   - 2 U FFP given INR 1.9 and will remove R Femoral line.
   - continue surveillance cultures from periphery
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP given fevers, secretions
   CXR findings and Sputum Cx, suggestive of s. aureus, there is also some
   component of volume overload based on CXR.  Pt. on CPAP 10/5, is
   tachypneic w/ nl oxygenation and improved aA gradient.  Given continued
   secretions and tachypnea, will reassess for intubation later today or
   in AM, despite RSBI of 80.
   - continue to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   - will hold on diuresis today given hypotension, once off levaphed and
   BPs stable, may do gentle diuresis.
   - Will increase pressure support to increase Tv and reduce tachypnea
   and prevent fatigue.  Will recheck ABG, if CO2 above nl, will reassess
   and consider switching to CMV.  Goal to extubated tomorrow.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  Neuro exam off propofol is indicative
   of overall good prognosis, based on studies, has 50% chance of
   meaningful recovery, however prognosis still guarded given current
   clinical picture.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - Wean propofol as tolerated
   - f/u EEG read
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # ELEVATED COAGS:  Coags trending down INR 1.9 today and PTT 36.  Pt is
   on coumadin at home, but it has been held since he was admitted.  DIC
   labs not worrisome at this time and there is no clinical signs of
   bleeding at line sites etc.  Platelets improving.
   -          FFP today for line removal
   -          Will restart coumadin today after IJ line placed and femoral
   removed.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Stable, Cr 1.2 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   2 days.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin, PR dosed
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # RHYTHM: Patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a history
   of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation shows that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.9.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - ICD placement pending evidence of neurologic recovery per EP
   - holding coumadin for now, will restart after FFP and line
   placement/removal completed
   # HTN:  Patient with history of hypertension, currently hypotensive and
   on a dopamine drip for pressure support.
   - Holding Metoprolol, HCTZ, Lisinopril (his home antihypertensives)
   FEN: tube feeds and reglan
   ACCESS: PIVs, R femoral groin line (inserted [**11-29**])  and A-line
   (inserted [**11-28**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -holding SC heparin due to coagulopathy, VD boots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling on a
   ventilator.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient continues on levophed and on the ventilator.  His pressure
   support was increased to 15 this am and he was eventually changed over
   to AC with PEEP of 5 voleume of 500 RR 12 and FiO2 40% in the
   afternoon.  His INR was 1.9 so he was given 2 units of FFP and a right
   IJ was placed.  His groin line was pulled and the cath tip was sent for
   cx.  No new recs from neuro.  EP had no new recs, will continue to
   follow.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently intubated and on a ventilator with a diagnosis of sepsis, Pseudomonas pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin, which was held upon admission. He is also on levophed for pressure support and has a right internal jugular (RIJ) line inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications from sepsis, including organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
2. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of Pseudomonas pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
3. VAP: The patient has VAP, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac events, including ventricular fibrillation (VF) and cardiac tamponade.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and death.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator dependence, respiratory acidosis, and death.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, and death.

Plan:

1. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac rhythm with anti-arrhythmic medications and cardioversion as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Consider a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger for the patient's cardiac arrest.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider supplementation if necessary.
8. Consider a trial of gentle diuresis to achieve euvolemia once the patient's sepsis resolves."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF, will discuss w/
   pharmacy)
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: tube feeds
   ACCESS: PIVs, A-line (inserted [**11-28**]), RIJ ([**2194-12-3**])

   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   FAMILY/SOCIAL:
   Discussed with family yesterday the events to date, the goals treatment
   in the next few days and that patient has deteriorated since last two
   days in setting of sepsis.  Discussed that prognosis remains guarded.
   Family appears to understand  the events to date, the care provided and
   immediate goals.  Will be updating family on daily basis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF, will discuss w/
   pharmacy)
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS

   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with cardiac arrest, sepsis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after rewarming from cooling therapy. The patient's condition has been complicated by pseudomonal line infection, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 76 bpm
* Blood pressure: 108/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 144 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Glucose: 195 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis: Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis with sources including the femoral line and pulmonary VAP.
* Respiratory failure: likely secondary to VAP with Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive, with fevers, chest radiograph findings, and sputum culture.
* Cardiac arrest: with a differential diagnosis including ischemia vs. prior myocardial infarction and scar tissue causing arrhythmia.
* Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal due to hypoperfusion, but may be progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Congestive heart failure: likely acute on chronic, with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
* Anemia: likely dilutional, but also with elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV).
* Hyperglycemia: likely sepsis-related.

The patient's current medications include:

* Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) for double coverage of Pseudomonas sepsis
* Tobramycin for Pseudomonas sepsis
* Nafcillin for MSSA in sputum
* Amiodarone for rhythm control and possible cardioversion
* Heparin for AF
* Coumadin for AF
* Lantus for hyperglycemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Treating sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care
* Managing respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Monitoring cardiac function with echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Managing acute renal failure with fluid restriction and renally-dosed medications
* Managing congestive heart failure with diuretics and vasodilators
* Monitoring anemia with serial complete blood counts (CBCs) and transfusions as needed
* Managing hyperglycemia with insulin and blood glucose monitoring

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the severity of his illness and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction."

   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.4.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Will start Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday, baseline TFTs
   - ICD placement to be evaluated

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.4 (1.2 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   - U/A sediment examination ordered
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic:  He had a TTE here
   showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,
   likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF
   of 50% from [**2191**].  Slowly increasing volume status on exam, but unclear
   whether this is due to HF alone, given Alb of 3.0.  Once sepsis
   resolves, will consider gentle lasix to achieve euvolemia.
   - Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 10-12 with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn and will add Tobramycin for double coverage of
   Pseudomonas sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of
   line removal, total 14d.
   - Vancomycin for GPC in clusters suggestive of S. aureus in sputum.
   ABx started on [**12-1**], total of 14d.

   PaO2/FiO2
 265, thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG suggestive of mixed respiratory and
   metabolic alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, despite increased
   pressure support.  Possible Cheyene
s [**Doctor Last Name 2022**] resp observed by
   respiratory suggestive of CNS etiology in addition to sepsis. Must
   improve resp. status significantly prior to attempted extubation.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and PEEP of 5
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, and AF. He presented with cardiac arrest, was cooled and rewarmed, and is now septic with Pseudomonas infection and VAP. He has a pseudomonal line infection and PNA. He is currently off pressors and has a septic shock process with distributive shock features. He has respiratory failure likely secondary to VAP, and is tachypneic with mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. He has cardiac arrest with a differential including ischemia vs. prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia. He is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial fibrillation, and is on coumadin as an outpatient. He has acute renal failure likely due to pre-renal renal hypoperfusion, and has a history of CAD with possible ischemic changes on EKG.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock process may continue to deteriorate, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may recur, leading to further cardiac damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Infection: The patient's pseudomonal line infection and PNA may lead to further infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Ischemic Changes: The patient's ischemic changes on EKG may worsen, leading to further cardiac damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock process with aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and sedation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac arrest and consider cardioversion and ICD placement as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's acute renal failure and consider renal replacement therapy as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and consider further antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Consider further cardiac catheterization to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger for the patient's cardiac arrest."

   Chief Complaint: Cardiac arrest, sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   Neuro exam off sedation today much improved, pt following multiple
   commands, opening/closing eyes, responding to questions in yes/no
   manner appropirately.  Levophed weaned, then restarted given
   hypotension in AM.  Currently on 0.06.  Tachypnea improved to 20s even
   off sedation.  Increased PEEP to 10cm.  Sputum GPC was noted to be
   MSSA, thus switched vancomycin to nafcillin IV.  GNRs in sputum
   are ENTEROBACTERIACEAE, sensitive to zosyn and tobramycin (will touch
   base w/ ID in AM re: pairing down ABx).  Pt. continues to be positive >
   1L per day with increasing periphearal edema.  Discussed w/ pharmacy
   re: more concentrated ABx, this is not possible.  Reduced free water
   flushes w/ feeds and stopped TF at 10pm due to 1.5L positive.   Family
   updated on clinicial status and guarded prognosis.  Blood sugars in the
   200s (got 12 units insulin over the day).  Will attempt extubation in
   AM given RSBI of 68.  Will likely undergo cardioversion on Monday after
   Amio loading to help w/ atrial kick.

   CXR: Imroved R opacity, worsened L LL opacity, increased vascular
   markings.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: tube feeds
   ACCESS: PIVs, A-line (inserted [**11-28**]), can pull this if extubated
   successfully, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**])
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -heparin drip
   -Pain management with tylenol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Cardiac arrest, sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   Neuro exam off sedation today much improved, pt following multiple
   commands, opening/closing eyes, responding to questions in yes/no
   manner appropirately.  Levophed weaned, then restarted given
   hypotension in AM.  Currently on 0.06.  Tachypnea improved to 20s even
   off sedation.  Increased PEEP to 10cm.  Sputum GPC was noted to be
   MSSA, thus switched vancomycin to nafcillin IV.  GNRs in sputum
   are ENTEROBACTERIACEAE, sensitive to zosyn and tobramycin (will touch
   base w/ ID in AM re: pairing down ABx).  Pt. continues to be positive >
   1L per day with increasing periphearal edema.  Discussed w/ pharmacy
   re: more concentrated ABx, this is not possible.  Reduced free water
   flushes w/ feeds and stopped TF at 10pm due to 1.5L positive.   Family
   updated on clinicial status and guarded prognosis.  Blood sugars in the
   200s (got 12 units insulin over the day).  Will attempt extubation in
   AM given RSBI of 68.  Will likely undergo cardioversion on Monday after
   Amio loading to help w/ atrial kick.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of CAD, CABG, and syncope.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial fibrillation. He received 2 shocks from an AED and is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control and cardioversion on Monday. He has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and is being ventilated with CPAP/PSV. His RSBI is 68, and he has been weaned to CPAP 5/5.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.3. He has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status has improved significantly, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. He is able to follow commands and is responding to verbal stimuli.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to Pseudomonas and MSSA in his sputum.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to VAP and likely secondary to HF.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has had a cardiac arrest, which is likely due to ischemia vs. prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal renal hypoperfusion and possibly progressing to ATN.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to dilutional and hemodilutional causes.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely due to sepsis-related causes.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and pressors.
* Continue respiratory support, including CPAP/PSV.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuresis as needed.
* Consider cardiac catheterization once the patient is off pressors and afebrile to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease.
* Consider ICD placement to prevent future cardiac arrest.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's volume status and adjust diuresis as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.

The patient's family has been updated on his progress and plans, and a code has been placed in the patient's chart."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, now off pressors.
   # Sepsis: Pseudomonas on BCx.  Sources include Femoral line (pulled
   [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Extremities are warm and increasing in
   edema esp. in UEs.  Pulse pressure 60 suggestive of elevated CO state.
   All this is suggestive of a distributive shock process.  UOP > 45cc/hr,
   CVP 14  with MAPs >60, parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  UA
   negative.
   - Treating w/ Zosyn, Tobramycin for double coverage of Pseudomonas
   sepsis (and unclear [**Name (NI) 467**] in Sputum), Day 1 is [**12-3**], day of line
   removal, total 14d.
   - Change to Nafcillin IV for MSSA in putum.   ABx started on [**12-1**],
   total of 14d.
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ Staph aureus coag +,
   [**Month/Year (2) 467**], w/ fevers, CXR findings and Sputum Cx. Pt. now also w/ Pulmonary
   edema on CXR and HF on exam.  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 217  thus
   [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved, but continues to have resp alkalosis w/ metabolic
   alkalosis.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic, but much improved now on
   midazolam/versed sedation RR of 20. DDx CNS etiology in addition to
   sepsis
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given just off pressors  today, but may require prior to
   extubation trial.
   - Will increase sedation as tolerated by BPs to reduce respiratory
   drive
   - TV at 400, incr. RR 10 and increase PEEP to 10, and monitor for
   decreased CVP.
   - AM RSBI.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam off propofol worsened, thus prognosis is
   guarded.    Per discussion w/ Neurology, no further imaging will be
   useful in determining further prognosis.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and possible
   cardioversion on Monday to augment filling, baseline TFTs wnl.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension.
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization when sepsis resolves to evaluate
   for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying trigger
   for his cardiac arrest.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF, will discuss w/
   pharmacy)
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope, and PPM, who presented with cardiac arrest, sepsis, and VAP. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to Pseudomonas sepsis, with sources including the femoral line and pulmonary with VAP. He is being treated with Zosyn and Tobramycin for double coverage. The patient's UOP is >45cc/hr, CVP is 14, and MAPs are >60, which are parameters at goal for treatment of septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely secondary VAP with Staph aureus coag+, with fevers, CXR findings, and Sputum Cx. He has pulmonary edema on CXR and HF on exam. His PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 217, indicating respiratory failure. He is being treated with ABx and sedation to reduce respiratory drive.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to ischemia vs. prior MI and scar tissue causing arrhythmia. His EEG is consistent with encephalopathy (toxic/metabolic). His neuro exam off propofol worsened, making his prognosis guarded.
4. Rhythm: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial fibrillation. He received 2 shocks from AED and is being treated with Amiodarone for rhythm control and possible cardioversion on Monday.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has fluctuating Cr levels, likely pre-renal renal hypoperfusion with episodes of hypotension over the last 3 days. He may be progressing to ATN, with no gran. casts on UA microscopy. He is being treated with renally-dose medications.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, with a prior CABG and LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag, and SVG to PDA. He may have ischemic changes on EKG, but his CKs are relatively low, suggesting VT, CPR, and shocks.
7. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has likely acute on chronic congestive heart failure, with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. He has a TTE showing an EF of 15-20% and is being treated with diuretics.
8. Anemia: The patient has likely dilutional anemia, but also has an elevated MCV. His HCT is low, but stable. He is being treated with QD HCT.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia likely related to sepsis, with no hx of DM. His BGs are in the 200s, and he is being treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening sepsis and septic shock
2. Respiratory failure and need for intubation
3. Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
4. Acute kidney injury and need for dialysis
5. Congestive heart failure and need for mechanical support
6. Anemia and bleeding complications
7. Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis
8. Sepsis-related encephalopathy and need for neurocritical care
9. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other pain.  Had been
   having a lot of stool, but is formed and not loose.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other pain.  Had been
   having a lot of stool, but is formed and not loose.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, and AF, who presented with cardiac arrest, was cooled, and then rewarmed.
* The patient is now extubated and off pressors, but still requires oxygen therapy at 5 L via nasal cannula.
* He has a diagnosis of Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* The patient has congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic, with an EF of 15-20% and severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
* He has anemia, with a decreasing Hct level, likely due to a combination of dilutional, acute illness, and phlebotomy.
* The patient has acute renal failure, with a fluctuating Cr level, likely pre-renal renal hypoperfusion, but may be progressing to ATN.
* He has a history of CAD, with a previous CABG and catheterization showing 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3 and TO of RCA.
* The patient has hyperglycemia, likely related to sepsis, and is being treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly cardiac, respiratory, and renal.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI) due to VAP.
3. Further decline in cardiac function, potentially leading to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
4. Progression of acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Development of complications related to anemia, such as bleeding or cardiovascular instability.
6. Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, due to underlying cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Potential for ischemic changes or infarction in the setting of CAD and acute coronary syndrome.
8. Risk of nosocomial infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).

   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other pain.  Had been
   having a lot of stool, but is formed and not loose.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   FAMILY/SOCIAL:
   Family updated on progress and plans.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He was intubated and received cooling and rewarming therapy. He was extubated and is now on nasal cannula oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75-86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 74/19 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. He has a central venous catheter and is receiving antibiotics for Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP. His laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, and acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of CAD and AF, and his cardiac function is compromised, which may lead to further heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated and extubated, and he may experience respiratory failure if his respiratory status deteriorates.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of AF and has received cardioversion, which may lead to further rhythm disturbances if not managed properly.
8. Infection: The patient has Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP, which may lead to further infections if not managed properly.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his transfusion regimen as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's rhythm disturbances and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust his antibiotic regimen as needed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed to manage his various medical conditions.
3. Consider placing the patient on a cardiac monitor to monitor his cardiac rhythm.
4. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function.
5. Consider performing a echocardiogram to assess the patient's cardiac function.
6. Consider performing a renal ultrasound to assess the patient's renal function.

   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning.  PT/OT and speech and
   swallow were consulted.  ID was curbsided for antibiotic management and
   recommended stoppign zosyn and tobramycin and treating his pansensitive
   psudomonas bactermia for 14 days with ciprofloxacin from when the line
   was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14
   days of nafcillin for the MSSA in his sputum.  His levophed was weaned
   off mid-morning.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion on
   Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning.  PT/OT and speech and
   swallow were consulted.  ID was curbsided for antibiotic management and
   recommended stoppign zosyn and tobramycin and treating his pansensitive
   psudomonas bactermia for 14 days with ciprofloxacin from when the line
   was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14
   days of nafcillin for the MSSA in his sputum.  His levophed was weaned
   off mid-morning.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion on
   Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: tube feeds
   ACCESS: PIVs, A-line (inserted [**11-28**]), can pull this if extubated
   successfully, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**])

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 7.6 liters of fluid overload, with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 74/19 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has a pseudomonas sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in his sputum. He is receiving treatment with ciprofloxacin and nafcillin for 14 days. The patient's lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. He is receiving treatment with diuretics and is being monitored for signs of worsening renal function.

The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20% and is at risk for further cardiac complications.

The patient's anemia is likely dilutional, but also may be related to his underlying medical conditions. His hemoglobin level is 8.5 g/dL, and his mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 23.0%.

The patient's hyperglycemia is likely related to his sepsis and is being treated with insulin.

The patient's family has been updated on his progress and plans, and a code status has been established as full code.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's pseudomonas sepsis and VAP are being treated with antibiotics, but he remains at risk for further complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and AF, combined with his current cardiac arrest and decreased LVEF, make him at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is being treated with diuretics, but he remains at risk for further worsening of his renal function.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely dilutional, but also may be related to his underlying medical conditions. He may require further treatment with blood transfusions or other anemia treatments.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is being treated with insulin, but he remains at risk for further complications related to his hyperglycemia.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's VAP is being treated with antibiotics, but he remains at risk for further pulmonary complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming with Pseudomonas
   sepsis and VAP, back on pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  Lactate 1.3,
   continues to require pressors,  UOP > 45cc/hr, CVP 8  with MAPs >60,
   parameters at goal for tx of septic shock.  Improving overall.
   - Will change to Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for  total
   treatment of 14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Daily surveillance Cx
   - Levophed prn for MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   # Respiratory Failure: likely secondary VAP w/ MSSA and GNRs (see
   above).  Large Aa gradient, PaO2/FiO2
 256  thus [**Doctor Last Name 2**].  ABG improved
   RSBI today 68, pt. weaned to CPAP 5/5 this am.  HF likely contributing
   as well, but O2 requirement improving.
   - continue to treat with ABx as above
   - No diuresis given still on pressors  today.
   - Extubation trial today, if successful, speech and swallow.
   - If stays extubated, d/c a-line.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.   Extubation
   today.
   - continue neuro checks off sedation
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now, until conversion trial
   # RHYTHM: Patient in atrial fibrillation and has a history of atrial
   fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.  His PPM
   interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was preceded by VF.
   Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 1.7.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue  Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   on Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin now and bridge w/ heparin
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.4 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no gran. Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue holding his B-blocker given hypotension will restart once
   off pressors
   - Consider a cardiac catheterization once off pressors and afebrile to
   evaluate for and treat ischemic disease which could be the underlying
   trigger for his cardiac arrest, after the conversion.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +7.6L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Increasing volume status on exam.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   require some lasix prior to extubation trial and if BPs tolerate.  Na
   dropping.
   -          Holding his home B-blocker and ACEI given his hypotension.
   -          Minimize volume load (e.g. free water in TF), reducing water
   load by narrowing down ABx.
   # Anemia
 likely dilutional, but also w/ elevated MCV.  HCT low, but
   stable.  Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or
   labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider intraabdominal/RP
   source eval if continues to drop.   Likely hemodilutional give volume
   expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe studies results.
   -          QD HCT
   # Hyperglycemia
 likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   -          Increase Lantus w/ RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM,
   AF who presented with cardiac arrest now warmed after cooling now s/p
   extubation.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was extubated Saturday morning and levophed was weaned off
   by midmorning.  PT/OT and speech and swallow were consulted.  ID was
   curbsided for antibiotic management and recommended stopping zosyn and
   tobramycin and treating his pansensitive psudomonas bactermia for 14
   days with ciprofloxacin from when the line was pulled ([**12-4**]) and for
   the enterobacteriacae in his sputum, and 14 days of nafcillin for the
   MSSA in his sputum.  It is planned that he will undergo cardioversion
   on Monday.  His A-line was removed as he is now off levophed.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other pain.  Had been
   having a lot of stool, but is formed and not loose.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who suffered cardiac arrest, was cooled, and is now being treated for sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been extubated and is being weaned off pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further sepsis due to his ongoing infection and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MSSA in his sputum.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk of developing further respiratory failure due to his VAP and underlying lung disease.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a combination of factors, including ischemia, prior MI, and scar tissue. He is at risk of developing further cardiac arrests due to his underlying cardiac disease and the presence of atrial fibrillation.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is fluctuating, and he is at risk of developing further acute renal failure due to his ongoing sepsis and underlying kidney disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to dilutional anemia, but he is also at risk of developing further anemia due to his ongoing blood loss and underlying kidney disease.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to sepsis, but he is also at risk of developing further hyperglycemia due to his underlying diabetes and the presence of stress hormones.
7. Cardiac catheterization: The patient's cardiac catheterization is planned to evaluate for and treat ischemic disease, which could be the underlying trigger for his cardiac arrest.

The patient's medical treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to treat his sepsis and VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Sepsis:  Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.  Sources include
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) and Pulmonary w/ VAP.  He was weaned off
   pressors yesterday and his antibiotics were narrowed from tobramycin
   and zosyn to cipro.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA and Cipro for GNRs for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**].
   - Will touch base with ID to check if nafcillin can be changed to a po
   medication.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Now much more
   volume overloaded on exam, LOS +8.4L.  TTE here showing an EF of 15-20%
   w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed
   by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and
   reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Volume overloaded on exam.  Now that he is
   off pressors and his SBP have been stable, can start diuresis.
   - Will start aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1.5 to 2 L negative/day.
   - Restart Metoprolol 6.25 mg tid.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF and recent hypotension.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest as some
   of his systolic dysfunction is likely from cardiac stunning.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct continues to slowly trend downwards (is
   22.4 today) Likely a combination of dilutional, acute illnees, and
   phlebotomy.   Guiacs negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on
   exam or labs.  No evidence of large echymoses.  Will consider
   intraabdominal/RP source eval if continues to drop.   Likely
   hemodilutional give volume expansion, at baseline also ACD given Fe
   studies results.
   - Will recheck hemolysis labs.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - Will hold off transfusion for now as he is not currently ischemic and
   a transfusion would give additional volume while he is already volume
   overloaded with a low EF.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated yesterday morning.  He continues on 5 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone for a goal of 1.5 to 2
   L negative.
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - Will hold off on catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have
   been ischemic in origin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 3.1.   Goal
   [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion on
   Monday to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Continue coumadin; heparin gtt stopped as he is therapeutic on
   coumadin.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Fluctuating, Cr 1.3 (1.3 yesterday).  Likely
   pre-renal [**1-18**] renal hypoperfusion w/ episodes of hypotension over last
   3 days, but may be progressing to ATN, no granular Casts on UA
   microscopy.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Restart his B-blocker as above.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM.  Elevated
   BGs in 200s.
   - Continue Lantus w/ RISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, RIJ ([**2194-12-3**]) -> will discuss with ID if nafcillin can
   be changed to a po medication (if so, will pull the RIJ, if not, then
   he will need a PICC and then this can be pulled).

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He has a history of CAD, CABG, and PPM, and is currently being treated for Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP. He is off pressors and has been extubated, but is still requiring oxygen therapy. His cardiac function is impaired, with an EF of 15-20% and severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. He is also experiencing anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac function is impaired, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's VAP is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
7. Infection: The patient's sepsis is likely to lead to further infections, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue to treat his sepsis and VAP, and to monitor his cardiac function and renal function closely. He will also require further treatment and monitoring for his anemia, hyperglycemia, and potential cardiac and respiratory complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ slight diuresis w/ 20mg lasix.   LOS +7.4L.  TTE
   here showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior
   echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Started on
   Aldactone yesterday for hypokalemia and aid w/ diuresis.  Will continue
   diuresis and monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1 to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - Repeat ECHO now that Sepsis resolved.
   - Uptightrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid as BPs tolerate w/ diuresis.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - Will recheck albumin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.8, likely
   [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   today after ECHO  to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Hold coumadin today and tomorrow
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 1.9, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given nafcillin/tobramycin.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3^rd space fluid shifts
   into intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Urine microscopy, lytes.  Eos peripherally and urinary.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 8
   - Continue Cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 467**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to PO,  for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**], today is day 6.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ slight diuresis w/ 20mg lasix.   LOS +7.4L.  TTE
   here showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior
   echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Started on
   Aldactone yesterday for hypokalemia and aid w/ diuresis.  Will continue
   diuresis and monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1 to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - Repeat ECHO now that Sepsis resolved.
   - Uptightrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid as BPs tolerate w/ diuresis.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - Will recheck albumin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.8, likely
   [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   today after ECHO  to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Hold coumadin today and tomorrow
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 1.9, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given nafcillin/tobramycin.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3^rd space fluid shifts
   into intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Urine microscopy, lytes.  Eos peripherally and urinary.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 8
   - Continue Cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 467**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to PO,  for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**], today is day 6.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, PICC line.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
   FAMILY/SOCIAL:
   Family updated on progress and plans daily.
   CODE: Full, confirmed w/ family.
   DISPO: Transfer to floor today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has a permanent pacemaker (PPM). He presented with cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF) and was treated with two shocks from an automated external defibrillator (AED). He was resuscitated and is now off pressors.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and is volume overloaded. He is being treated with diuretics and is awaiting a repeat echocardiogram (TTE) to reassess his cardiac function.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.9 mg/dL, and he is being treated with diuretics to promote diuresis. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and amiodarone-induced nephrotoxicity.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 9.0 g/dL, and his hematocrit (Hct) is 24.5%. The cause of anemia is likely a combination of dilutional, anemia of chronic disease (ACD), and phlebotomy.
4. Sepsis: The patient has resolved sepsis, but he still requires treatment for VAP and has a history of Pseudomonas sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is being treated for VAP with antibiotics.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, likely due to sepsis, and he is being treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of cardiac function, leading to cardiac arrest or death.
2. Progression of ARF, requiring dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
3. Development of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria, due to the patient's anemia and the use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Infection with resistant organisms, such as Pseudomonas, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support.
6. Hyperglycemic emergencies, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued treatment for CHF, including diuretics and consideration for ICD placement.
2. Management of ARF, including diuretics and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
3. Treatment of anemia, including transfusions if necessary.
4. Continued treatment for VAP and sepsis, including antibiotics and surveillance cultures.
5. Management of respiratory failure, including weaning from oxygen therapy and consideration for mechanical ventilation.
6. Treatment of hyperglycemia, including insulin therapy and dietary management.

The patient's family has been updated on his progress and plans daily, and he has a full code status. He is expected to be transferred to the floor today."

   ECHO - There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm, new.
   Compared to [**11-29**], LVEF is now 20-25%, the inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis persists. The other segments have slightly better function.
   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ diuresis w/ 20mg lasix x 2 with negative 1.3 L.
   LOS +6 L.  TTE here showing slightly improved pumpf function,  EF of
   20-25% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD
   superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50%
   from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Had started Aldactone, but was
   stopped yesterday due to concern of AIN.  Will continue diuresis and
   monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue diuresis with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a goal of 1
   to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - continue  12.5 mg tid
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - continue anticoagulation for new aneurism
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.4, likely
   elevated [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].  Attempt at cardioverson
   unsuccessful.
   - D/C AMIODERONE
   - ICD placement to be evaluated with possible CRT
   - Hold coumadin until INR at goal
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 2.1, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given
   nafcillin/tobramycin/sprionolactone and rare eos in urine.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   - d/c
d cefazolin and spironolactone
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  Was on Nafcillin and Cipro IV for
   above organisms, switched to PO cipro and cazolin with concern of AIN.
   Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue cefazolin  for MSSA for total of 10 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 9
   - Continue Cipro for GNRs, switched to PO, for total treatment of 14d,
   day one [**12-3**], today is day 7.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - give incentive spirometry
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. persistent anemia, Fe studies consistent w/ ACD, no hemolysis.
   Repeat echo showed slightly improved EF to 20-25%, new LV aneurysm at
   inferobasal regions, persistent akinesis at inf and inflateral areas,
   persistent AS, MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] TR.  Dialated aortic sinus and ascending
   aorta, 4.3 and 4.5 respectively.
   Cardioversion attempted yesterday for afib, biphasic 200, then 300J w/
   no effect.  Pt. will require 1mo f/u w/ cards and ECHO to assess for
   ICD.  Pt received Lasix 40mg IV for volume overload, Alb was 3.1.  Had
   worsening renal failure, w/ Cr up to 2.1 (PM lytes) from 1.3 in AM of
   [**12-7**], will hold off on further diuresis.  UA showed rare WBC casts and
   pos for Eos, peripheral still pending, FEUrea 37%.  Pt was switched
   from Nafcillin to Cefazolin IV for MSSA in sputum, needs 2 more days.
   IV Cipro was changed to PO (day 1 = [**12-3**], needs total of 14d).  ID
   curbsided, agreed w/ above.
   Spironolactone was d/ced.  Metoprolol increased to 12.5mg PO TID.  INR
   4.8 on 2mg, coumadin d/ced, likely [**1-18**] pt being on amio and cipro.
   PICC line placed, PT consulted and recommended rehab. Pt. w/ frequent
   stools, C. Diff negative X 1, #2 pending.  Can likely go to floor today

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued cardiac arrest risk due to depressed EF (20-25%) and new LV aneurysm.
	* Potential for ICD placement to prevent sudden cardiac death.
	* Continued risk of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, due to history of atrial fibrillation and coumadin use.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute renal failure (ARF) with Cr levels increasing to 2.1 mg/dL.
	* Potential for ATN or AIN given timing of hypotensive episodes and medication use.
	* Risk of worsening renal function with continued diuresis and medication use.
3. Infectious complications:
	* Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP have resolved, but patient is still at risk for developing new infections.
	* Continued risk of catheter-related infections due to PICC line and PIVs.
4. Respiratory complications:
	* Risk of respiratory failure due to continued use of 4 L NC and potential for VAP to recur.
	* Risk of weaning from oxygen therapy too quickly.
5. Anemia complications:
	* Patient's Hct is still low (24.5%), and dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy may be contributing factors.
	* Risk of further anemia worsening due to ongoing phlebotomy and potential for bleeding.
6. Neurological complications:
	* Risk of encephalopathy due to toxic or metabolic causes.
	* Potential for further neurological deterioration due to continued use of sedatives and potential for seizures.
7. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to continued use of anticoagulation and potential for stress ulcer.
	* Risk of further gastrointestinal complications due to continued use of antacids and potential for bowel obstruction.
8. Hematological complications:
	* Risk of further bleeding due to continued use of anticoagulation and potential for AIN.
	* Risk of further anemia worsening due to ongoing phlebotomy and potential for bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of complications due to their underlying medical conditions and treatment. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or minimize these complications."

   Rare positive urine eos
   UA unremarkable otherwise.
   ECHO - There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm, new.
   Compared to [**11-29**], LVEF is now 20-25%, the inferior and inferolateral
   akinesis persists. The other segments have slightly better function.
   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ diuresis w/ 20mg lasix x 2 with negative 1.3 L.
   LOS +6 L.  TTE here showing slightly improved pumpf function,  EF of
   20-25% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD
   superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50%
   from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Had started Aldactone, but was
   stopped yesterday due to concern of AIN.  Will continue diuresis and
   monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue diuresis with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a goal of 1
   to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - continue  12.5 mg tid
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - restart spironolactone
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.4, likely
   elevated [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].  Attempt at
   cardioversion unsuccessful.
   - continue amioderone
   - schedule for repeat attempt at cardioversion in 3 weeks.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated with possible CRT
   - Hold coumadin until INR at goal
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 2.1, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given
   nafcillin/tobramycin/sprionolactone and rare eos in urine.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   - d/c
d nafcillin, switched to cefazolin
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   - start on iron and folate supplementation
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  Was on Nafcillin and Cipro IV for
   above organisms, switched to PO cipro and cazolin with concern of AIN.
   Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue cefazolin  for MSSA for total of 10 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 9
   - Continue Cipro for GNRs, switched to PO, for total treatment of 14d,
   day one [**12-3**], today is day 7.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - give incentive spirometry
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient
s diet can be advanced pending speech and swallow recs.
   ACCESS: PIVs, PICC line.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Systemic anticoagulation with coumadin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ diuresis w/ 20mg lasix x 2 with negative 1.3 L.
   LOS +6 L.  TTE here showing slightly improved pumpf function,  EF of
   20-25% w/ severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, likely CAD
   superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior echo shows EF of 50%
   from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Had started Aldactone, but was
   stopped yesterday due to concern of AIN.  Will continue diuresis and
   monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue diuresis with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a goal of 1
   to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - continue  12.5 mg tid
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - restart spironolactone
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.4, likely
   elevated [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].  Attempt at
   cardioversion unsuccessful.
   - continue amioderone
   - schedule for repeat attempt at cardioversion in 3 weeks.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated with possible CRT
   - Hold coumadin until INR at goal
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 2.1, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given
   nafcillin/tobramycin/sprionolactone and rare eos in urine.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   - d/c
d nafcillin, switched to cefazolin
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   - start on iron and folate supplementation
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  Was on Nafcillin and Cipro IV for
   above organisms, switched to PO cipro and cazolin with concern of AIN.
   Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue cefazolin  for MSSA for total of 10 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 9
   - Continue Cipro for GNRs, switched to PO, for total treatment of 14d,
   day one [**12-3**], today is day 7.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - give incentive spirometry
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.
   - Increase Lantus and switch to HISS
   FEN: Patient

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and sepsis. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. 

The patient's cardiac function has improved slightly, with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, but he still has severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. He has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. He is currently on beta-blocker therapy and has been started on aspirin and simvastatin. 

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, and he has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. He is currently being treated with diuretics and has been switched from IV lasix to PO cipro. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to a combination of dilutional, anemia of chronic disease, and phlebotomy. He has been started on iron and folate supplementation. 

The patient's sepsis has resolved, but he is still being treated for pneumonia and VAP with antibiotics. 

The patient's respiratory function is improving, and he has been successfully extubated. He is currently on 4 L nasal cannula oxygen and is being weaned off oxygen therapy. 

The patient's hyperglycemia is likely related to sepsis, and he is being treated with insulin. 

The patient's pain management is being managed with tylenol, and he is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today
   is day 8
   - Continue Cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 467**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to PO,  for total treatment of
   14d, day one [**12-3**], today is day 6.
   # Respiratory Failure: Resolving.  The patient was successfully
   extubated [**12-6**].  He continues on 4 L NC.
   - Continue to treat his VAP with ABx as above.
   - Diuresis as above with IV lasix and aldactone
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hyperglycemia
 Likely sepsis related, pt w/ no hx of DM, pt contuing
   w/ elevated BGs in 200s in afternoon and 140s fasting in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. persistent anemia, Fe studies consistent w/ ACD, no hemolysis.
   Repeat echo showed slightly improved EF to 20-25%, new LV aneurysm at
   inferobasal regions, persistent akinesis at inf and inflateral areas,
   persistent AS, MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] TR.
   Cardioversion attempted yesterday for afib, biphasic 200, then 300J w/
   no effect.  Pt. will require 1mo f/u w/ cards and ECHO to assess for
   ICD.  Pt received Lasix 40mg IV for volume overload, Alb was 3.1.  Had
   worsening renal failure, w/ Cr up to 2.1 (PM lytes) from 1.3 in AM of
   [**12-7**], will hold off on further diuresis.  UA showed rare WBC casts and
   pos for Eos, peripheral still pending, FEUrea 37%.  Pt was switched
   from Nafcillin to Cefazolin IV for MSSA in sputum, needs 2 more days.
   IV Cipro was changed to PO (day 1 = [**12-3**], needs total of 14d).  ID
   curbsided, agreed w/ above.
   Spironolactone was d/ced.  Metoprolol increased to 12.5mg PO TID.  INR
   4.8 on 2mg, coumadin d/ced, likely [**1-18**] pt being on amio and cipro.
   PICC line placed, PT consulted and recommended rehab. Pt. w/ frequent
   stools, C. Diff negative X 1, #2 pending.  Can likely go to floor today

   The other findings - aortic stenosis, mild mitral and at least [**Month/Year (2) **]
   tricuspid regurgitation - are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD s/p CABG, syncope s/p PPM, AF who presented
   with cardiac arrest now s/p cooling and rewarming  and s/p extubation
   with Pseudomonas sepsis and VAP now off pressors.
   # Congestive heart failure, likely acute on chronic.  Continues to be
   volume overloaded, w/ slight diuresis w/ 20mg lasix.   LOS +7.4L.  TTE
   here showing an EF of 15-20% w/ severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, likely CAD superimposed by toxic/metabolic causes.  Prior
   echo shows EF of 50% from [**2191**] and reported 2mo PTA of 25%.  Started on
   Aldactone yesterday for hypokalemia and aid w/ diuresis.  Will continue
   diuresis and monitor Cr, now elevated.
   - Continue aldactone 25 mg daily for diuresis (due to his persistent
   hypokalemia) in conjunction with one-time doses of IV lasix prn for a
   goal of 1 to 1.5 L negative/day.
   - Repeat ECHO now that Sepsis resolved.
   - Uptightrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid as BPs tolerate w/ diuresis.
   - Holding his ACEI given his ARF.
   - Patient will need a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac
   function once out of the acute setting of recent cardiac arrest for
   possible ICD placement.
   - Will recheck albumin.
   # RHYTHM: Patient now V-paced on tele, but had been in atrial fib. and
   has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an
   outpatient.  His PPM interrogation showed that his cardiac arrest was
   preceded by VF.  Patient received 2 shocks from AED.  INR 4.8, likely
   [**1-18**] amiodarone and cipro.   Goal [**1-19**].
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for rhythm control and cardioversion
   today after ECHO  to augment filling.
   - ICD placement to be evaluated
   - Hold coumadin today and tomorrow
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  Cr. 1.9, yesterday am was 1.3 and 1.6 in
   afternoon.  Likely pre-renal [**1-18**] diuresis, possible ATN given timing of
   hypotensive episodes last week as well as some contribution from
   Amiodarone.  AIN is also on DDx given nafcillin/tobramycin.  Will
   continue to diurese gently today, as expect 3rd space fluid shifts into
   intravascular space w/ resolution of sepsis.
   -  Urine microscopy, lytes.  Eos peripherally and urinary.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Renally-dose meds
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD.  Per prior records, CABG in
   [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag and SVG to PDA.  Cath at that time
   showed 50% mid-LAD, 70% prox-LAD, 60% D1, 60% D3, 60% LCx, TO of OM3
   and TO of RCA.  Now w/ possible ischemic changes on EKG, but CKs are
   relatively low thus may be [**1-18**] VT, CPR and shocks.   LDL 49.
   - Continue a full dose aspirin
   - Continue B-blocker as above.
   - Continue Simvastatin 10mg QD
   # CARDIAC ARREST:  The differential includes ischemia vs. prior MI and
   scar tissue causing arrhythmia.  EEG consistent w/ encephalopathy
   (toxic/metabolic).  Neuro exam significantly improved.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - PT/OT, pt will require rehab.
   - Will likely be a candidate for ICD if EF continues to be depressed
   - No catheterization for now as this is unlikely to have been ischemic
   in origin.
   # Anemia
 The patient
s Hct improved, but still low (24.5 today)
   Likely a combination of dilutional, ACD, and phlebotomy.   Guiacs
   negative to date.  No evidence of hemolysis on exam or labs.  No
   evidence of large echymoses.  At baseline also ACD given Fe studies
   results.
   - Qday Hct to minimize phlebotomy unless he appears to be clinically
   bleeding.
   - No indication for transfusion.
   # Sepsis:  Resolved.  Pt w/ Pseudomonas on BCx and MSSA in sputum.
   Femoral line (pulled [**12-3**]) w/ Pseudomonas, and VAP w/ MSSA and
   Enterobacteriae.  Off pressors.  On Nafcillin and Cipro IV for above
   organisms.  Surveillance BCx have been NGTD
   - Continue Nafcillin for MSSA for total of 14 d, day 1 = [**12-1**], today

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, syncope, and PPM. He presented with cardiac arrest, sepsis, and VAP. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions.

The patient's cardiac status is of particular concern. He has a left ventricular aneurysm, new, with an EF of 20-25%. He has also had a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient. The patient received cardioversion attempts yesterday, but was unsuccessful. He will require a repeat TTE in a few weeks to reassess his cardiac function and consider ICD placement.

The patient's renal function is also a concern, with a Cr of 2.1 mg/dL and a history of acute renal failure. He is being treated with diuresis and will need to continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.

The patient's respiratory status is also a concern, with a history of respiratory failure and VAP. He was successfully extubated and is continuing on 4 L NC.

The patient's laboratory results are also concerning, with a Hct of 24.5%, which is low, and a Cr of 2.1 mg/dL. His albumin level is 3.1 g/dL, which is low.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, CABG, syncope, and PPM. He has also had a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin as an outpatient.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue diuresis with IV lasix and aldactone
* Repeat ECHO to assess cardiac function
* Uptitrate Metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid
* Hold ACEI due to ARF
* Continue Amiodarone 400mg for rhythm control and cardioversion
* ICD placement to be evaluated
* Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins
* Renally-dose meds
* Continue to treat VAP with ABx
* Wean O2 as tolerated
* Increase Lantus and switch to HISS for hyperglycemia
* Advance diet pending speech and swallow recs
* Continue pain management with tylenol
* Continue bowel regimen
* Continue systemic anticoagulation with coumadin
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's disposition is to transfer to the floor today."
