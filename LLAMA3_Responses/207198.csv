 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Parkinsons.
   - Sinemet once PO access established.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   .
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed
   and screened.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, hypertension, and a recent urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to her deteriorating condition.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever (102.2°F) and leukocytosis (13.1 K/uL)
* Altered mental status, including delirium and lethargy
* Tachycardia (58-104 bpm) and hypertension (120/56-204/122 mmHg)
* Hypernatremia (Na 144 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K 2.7 mEq/L)
* Hypercalcemia (Ca 9 mg/dL)
* Parkinson's disease, which is not well-controlled
* Recent addition of antibiotics, including metronidazole and vancomycin

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including:

* Blood cultures, urine cultures, and stool cultures
* Imaging studies, including a portable upright chest X-ray (CXR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* Electrolyte and fluid analysis
* Lactic acid and other laboratory tests

The patient's medical team is concerned about several potential complications, including:

* Intra-abdominal sepsis, given the patient's abdominal tenderness and fever
* Bacterial or viral meningitis, given the patient's altered mental status and fever
* Electrolyte and fluid disorders, given the patient's hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia
* Hypertension, which may be related to the patient's Parkinson's disease or other medications
* Delirium, which may be caused by the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued antibiotic therapy with metronidazole and vancomycin
* Addition of ceftriaxone for coverage of hospital-acquired organisms
* Monitoring of electrolyte and fluid levels
* Aggressive correction of hypernatremia and hypokalemia
* Management of hypertension and tachycardia
* Continued monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurologic function
* Further diagnostic testing, including a lumbar puncture (LP) and imaging studies, as needed

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team."

   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Parkinsons.
   - Sinemet once PO access established.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   .
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are concerning, with a fever of 102.2°F, tachycardia, and hypertension. Her respiratory status is stable, but her neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8.

The patient has a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and has been treated with various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. She also has a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which is currently being treated.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/μL, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 270 K/μL. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia.

The patient's medical conditions include Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, hypertension, and a history of UTIs. She is also taking multiple medications, including antiparkinsonian medications, antidepressants, and antihypertensive medications.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, sepsis is a possible complication.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, and her current symptoms may be related to a recurrence of the infection.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and tremors may be related to a neurological complication, such as a stroke or a seizure disorder.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia may be related to an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to serious complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to a medication side effect or a underlying medical condition.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and tachycardia may be related to an infection, such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.
7. Organ failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may be related to organ failure, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure.

Based on the patient's medical history and current symptoms, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and

   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer, who presented with hypertension, chest pain, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been treated with various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. However, she continues to experience fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest a possible septic response. The primary team is considering a non-infectious cause for her altered mental status, but it is essential to consider infectious causes, especially given her UTI and the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin A and B in her stool.
2. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient's hypernatremia and hypercalcemia require close monitoring and correction. Her hypernatremia is likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water, and her hypercalcemia may be related to volume depletion.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely reactive to hypovolemia, fever, and sepsis. It is essential to continue volume repletion and maintain euvolemia.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be caused by electrolyte abnormalities, infection, medication effect, or withdrawal. It is essential to aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities and perform a lumbar puncture to rule out central nervous system infection.
5. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease requires ongoing management, including the use of Sinemet once PO access is established.
6. Bipolar Disorder: The patient's bipolar disorder requires ongoing management, and it is essential to hold lithium per neurologic recommendations.
7. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's gastrointestinal issues, including nausea and vomiting, require close monitoring and management.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing management of her sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, tachycardia, delirium, Parkinson's disease, and bipolar disorder. It is essential to continue to monitor her laboratory results, vital signs, and neurological status. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are identified:

1. Infection: The patient has a high fever (102.2°F) and leukocytosis (13.1 K/uL), which may indicate an underlying infection. The stool culture is pending, and the patient has been treated with metronidazole and vancomycin.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (Na: 177 mg/dL), which may be due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. The patient also has hypokalemia (K: 2.7 mEq/L) and hypocalcemia (Ca: 8.7 mg/dL).
3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to electrolyte abnormalities, infection, medication effect, or withdrawal.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has a heart rate of 104 bpm, which may be due to hypovolemia, fever, or sepsis.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, which may be due to medication effect (sinemet) or labile blood pressure.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a calcium level of 0.8 mg/dL, which may be due to volume depletion.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a positive Gastrocult test and has been experiencing abdominal pain, which may indicate a gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory condition.
8. Neurological issues: The patient has Parkinson's disease and has been experiencing tremors, rigidity, and altered mental status, which may be related to medication withdrawal or infection.
9. Respiratory issues: The patient has a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%, which may indicate respiratory distress or infection.

Based on these findings, the patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Aggressive correction of electrolyte abnormalities
2. Infectious workup and management, including stool culture, blood cultures, and repeat urine culture
3. Neurological evaluation and management, including a lumbar puncture (LP) and neurology follow-up
4. Gastrointestinal management, including NGT suctioning and IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
5. Cardiovascular management, including continuation of lisinopril and propanolol
6. Pain management, including morphine sulfate infusion
7. Nutritional support, including IV fluids and glycemic control
8. Respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and monitoring of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, spinal stenosis, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the ICU with a fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable, with worsening leukocytosis and fever, but has recently improved with the administration of antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may be due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water. The patient's potassium levels are also abnormal, which may be related to her lithium use and high urine output.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, which may be due to electrolyte abnormalities, infection, medication effects, or withdrawal. The patient's EEG results are pending.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, ranging from 100-200 systolic, which may be related to medication effects, such as Sinemet, or other factors.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, which may be related to volume depletion. Normal albumin levels suggest that this is not due to hypoproteinemia.
5. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease may be exacerbating her symptoms, particularly her rigidity and tremors.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest that she may have an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
7. Medication-Induced Complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antipsychotics, which may be causing side effects or interactions.
8. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which needs to be further evaluated and managed.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypertension, and hypercalcemia need to be addressed. The patient's infection and delirium require further evaluation and treatment. The patient's Parkinson's disease and medication-induced complications also need to be managed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 with worsening leukocytosis to 20K
   yesterday, but now down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary
   source, on cipro since admission, with more recent addition of
   metronidazole.  Vancomycin was discontinued yesterday.  Primary team
   had concerns re: intra-abdominal source given tenderness on exam
   however CT abdomen did not reveal any source.  Patient continues to
   have altered mental status as below.  Consider noninfectious causes
   strongly as well, given overall hemodynamic stability with such
   significant fevers
 medication induced.
   - LP performed which shows lymphocytic predominance with chemistries
   suggestive of possible viral etiology
 will f/u HSV and cultures
   - continue to follow fever curve, WBC count, CXR, blood Cx, CSF Cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and acyclovir pending CSF Cx and HSV Cx of CSF
   fluid results concerning for some CNS process, consider stopping
   metronidazole given absence of intrabdominal pathology
   - -will continue to hold lexapro and TCA given possibility of SS vs.
   NLM
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, or sepsis.  TFT
s were checked and were WNL
s.  This may
   represent hypovolemia in setting of high fevers and volume loss.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - LP suggestive of some CNS process
 will continue to treat with
   Ceftriaxone and Acyclovir pending final LP results
   - continue to monitor and replete electrolytes PRN
   - will f/u EEG today
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Na responsive to D5W and free water flushes through tube feeds, will
   continue to monitor
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - consider adding standing dose of additional oral or increasing dose
   of standing oral
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # Parkinsons.  Sinemet once PO access established.
   - continue to f/u neuro recs.
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, spinal stenosis, and multiple UTIs. She was admitted to the ICU with deteriorating mental status, high fevers, and rigidity, and was found to have atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 104°F, with a recent decrease in leukocytosis from 20K to 13K
* Altered mental status: still present, with a recent LP showing lymphocytic predominance and chemistries suggestive of possible viral etiology
* Tachycardia: intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT, likely reactive to hypovolemia, fever, or sepsis
* Hypernatremia: likely due to insensible losses from high fever and inability to take in free water
* Hypertension: labile, ranging from 100-200s systolic, with some concern for med effect (sinemet)
* Hypercalcemia: likely volume depletion, with normal albumin
* Parkinson's disease: sinemet once PO access established
* Bipolar disorder: holding lithium per neuro recs

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Ceftriaxone and acyclovir for suspected CNS infection
* Sinemet for Parkinson's disease
* Propanolol for hypertension
* Lisinopril and propanolol for hypertension (if PO access established)
* Metoprolol for hypertension (if IV access established)
* Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis
* PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* CNS infection or sepsis
* Electrolyte imbalance (hypernatremia, hypercalcemia)
* Hypovolemia or dehydration
* Tachycardia or arrhythmia
* Hypertension or hypertension crisis
* Parkinson's disease exacerbation
* Bipolar disorder exacerbation
* Gastrointestinal complications (nausea, vomiting, constipation)
* Respiratory complications (pneumonia, respiratory failure)

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continue ceftriaxone and acyclovir pending CSF Cx and HSV Cx results
* Continue to monitor and replete electrolytes PRN
* Continue to follow fever curve, WBC count, CXR, blood Cx, CSF Cx results
* Continue to hold lexapro and TCA given possibility of SS vs. NLM
* Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia
* Continue to control fever
* Continue to monitor and replete electrolytes PRN
* Continue to follow EEG results

The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, with plans for further management and treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, spinal stenosis, and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the hospital for hypertension and UTI, but was later transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to deteriorating mental status, high fevers, and rigidity. The patient's laboratory results show elevated sodium, potassium, and calcium levels, as well as an elevated white blood cell count. She has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has a history of lithium use.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's elevated sodium, potassium, and calcium levels can lead to electrolyte imbalance, which can cause muscle weakness, cramping, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever of 104°F can lead to hyperthermia, which can cause heat stroke, seizures, and even death.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, and stiff neck, are consistent with meningitis. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows lymphocytic predominance, which may indicate a viral etiology.
5. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease can cause motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia.
6. Breast Cancer: The patient's breast cancer can cause symptoms such as breast pain, nipple discharge, and skin changes.
7. Spinal Stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis can cause symptoms such as back pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can cause symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and dizziness.
9. Lithium Toxicity: The patient's history of lithium use and elevated potassium levels can increase the risk of lithium toxicity, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and tremors.
10. UTI: The patient's UTI can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, frequency, and urgency.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current symptoms, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Parkinsons.
   - Sinemet once PO access established.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   .
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed
   and screened.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   84F with Parkinson's, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, presenting with
   hypertension, chest pain, and UTI; now with delerium, tachycardia, and
   fever to 104.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Fever to 104 (initially afebrile upon
   presentation) with worsening leukocytosis to 20K yesterday, but now
   down to 13K.  On admission suspected to be urinary source, on cipro
   since admission, with more recent addition of metronidazole and
   vancomycin.  Primary team had concerns re: intraabdominal source given
   ?tenderness on exam.  Also with altered mental status as below.
   Consider noninfectious causes strongly as well, given overall
   hemodynamic stability with such significant fevers
 med effect
   (?cipro), NMS given withdrawal of antiparkinsonian meds and
   tachycardia/hypertension, though seems quite unlikely with very low CK.
   Also could consider serotonin syndrome
   -will try to do LP to be done today
   - CXR, blood cultures, repeat urine culture, C.diff.
   - lactate slightly elevated
   -patient also extremely uncomfortable and winces with abdominal exam;
   Had hyperinternse area in pelvic area on MRI in [**6-21**]
   - Continue metronidazole and vanco for now, add GNR coverage of
   ceftriaxone for coverage of [**Hospital 8265**] hosp acquired orgs (given lack of
   response to cipro) and for CNS coverage.  Stop cipro.
   - Cover for bacterial/viral meningitis with ceftriaxone, vanco,
   acyclovir.
   -will hold lexapro and TCA for now
   .
   # Tachycardia.  Intermittently in Afib vs. flutter vs. MAT (difficult
   to appreciate baseline given tremor).  Likely reactive to hypovolemia,
   fever, ?sepsis.
   - Continue to volume replete/maintain euvolemia.
   - Fever control.
   - Infectious workup and management as above.
   - TFT's wnl
   - Continue home dose of propanolol to prevent withdrawal tachycardia.
   .
   # Delerium.  Multiple possible causes including electrolyte abnls
   (hyperNa in particular), infection (CNS infection or effects of UTI or
   other infection), med effect or med withdrawal (has been difficult to
   maintain PO access).
   - aggressively correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - LP as above.
   - Neuro following.
   - NGT for meds.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely due to insensible losses from high fever and
   inability to take in free water.  Also consider DI contributing given
   long term Li use and high UOP; [**Male First Name (un) **] excess with low Na/high K.
   - Replete with NS; maintenance with 1/2 NS b/c hyperglycemic yesterday
   with D51/2NS. Free water via NGT once placed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to TID lytes.
   .
   # Hypertension.  Some artifactal given UE rigidity.  Has been very
   labile overall - ranging from 100-200s systolic.  Some concern for med
   effect (sinemet)
   - continue current dose of lisinopril and propanolol if can establish
   PO access; otherwise can start IV enalapril or metoprolol.
   - Thigh pressures with doppler if getting high readings.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia.  Likely volume depletion.  Normal albumin.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Parkinsons.
   - Sinemet once PO access established.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   .
   # Bipolar disorder.
   - Holding Lithium per neuro recs.
   .
   # Gastrocult positive. NGT suctioning earlier during admission.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.
   - Monitor Hct.  Hemoconcentrated yesterday (37-->40-->45-->37). Typed
   and screened.
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with a fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, which is elevated, but has decreased from a peak of 20K yesterday. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin for suspected urinary tract infection.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 146 mEq/L, which is elevated. Her potassium level is 3.6 mEq/L, which is low. Her lactate level is slightly elevated at 2.1 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be caused by electrolyte imbalances, infection, or medication effects.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a blood pressure of 128/59 mmHg, which is elevated.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever of 104°F, which is likely caused by infection.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an irregular heartbeat, which may be caused by electrolyte imbalances, infection, or medication effects.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and fever may be caused by meningitis.
3. Parkinson's disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease may be exacerbated by her altered mental status and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other symptoms.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Infectious workup: The patient will undergo further testing to determine the cause of her fever and altered mental status.
2. Electrolyte management: The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored and managed to prevent further imbalances.
3. Cardiovascular management: The patient's blood pressure will be closely monitored and managed to prevent further elevation.
4. Neurological management: The patient's altered mental status will be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration.
5. Medication management: The patient's medications will be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."
