   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - EEG showed focal seizure activity, so neurology consulted.  They gave
   ativan with some correction of seizure activity and recommended
   dilantin loading prior to expected burr hole procedure.
   - 5pm dilantin level 17.7, which with albumin of 3.3 and low Cr
   clearance corrects to level of 41.2.  Will not give further dilantin
   tonight and reassess with neuro in AM.
   - Family gave consent to neurosurg for procedure, but were worried when
   anesthesia explained that he may be difficult to extubate.
   - Per nursing, has basically been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub
   since ativan and dilantin

   Imaging: [**11-14**] EEG pending
   [**11-13**] CT without contrast
   FINDINGS: There is a new large 2.5 cm fluid collection in a lentiform
   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.
   [**11-13**] CXR portable
   IMPRESSION: Unchanged retrocardiac opacification which likely
   represents
   atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying infectious
   process
   cannot be excluded.

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in pt with ESRD
   and elderly.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
   - If doesn
t wake up may need drugs dialyzed off?
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,
   however apparently they were hesitant after speaking anesthesia
   - F/u with family about whether they want to do the NSurg procedure
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg
   - Is NPO for procedure
   - Hold SubQ heparin
   - Given Dilantin load for seizures, will hold on further administration
   due to decreased responsiveness
   3. Seizure activity:
   - Was given ativan and dilantin and is now unresponsive
   - F/u with Neurology this am
   - Repeat EEG in context of unresponsiveness
   Low grade fevers: No clear signs of infection but with suspicious
   opacity on CXR
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Needs UA and UCx
   - Hold off on ABx for now
   -ESRD on hemodialysis: Received dialysis Saturday.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - renal consult in AM for dialysis in house
   Asthma: Stable.
   - continue Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
   Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive:  Per notes, patient has had a
   substantial decline recently and has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status.
   Currently unable to respond to questions.
   - continue mirtazapine
   - will need to discuss goals of care with family
   Hypertension:
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, and ESRD on hemodialysis, presents to the ICU with a syncopal episode and a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. The patient has been experiencing a significant decline over the past couple of months, and family has been discussing a burr hole procedure with neurosurgery. The patient was given Ativan and Dilantin for seizure activity, which has resulted in decreased responsiveness. The patient's condition is unstable, with low-grade fevers, and there is concern about the possibility of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of infection due to decreased responsiveness and potential for aspiration.
2. Complications from the subdural fluid collection, including increased intracranial pressure and potential for herniation.
3. Seizure activity, which may worsen with continued sedation and potentially lead to status epilepticus.
4. Malnutrition and failure to thrive, which may exacerbate the patient's overall condition.
5. Hypertension, which may need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications.
6. Hyperlipidemia, which may require further management to prevent complications.
7. ESRD on hemodialysis, which may require adjustments to the patient's treatment plan.
8. Dementia, which may impact the patient's ability to respond to medical interventions and may require additional support and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely.
2. Consider repeating the head CT to assess the size and location of the subdural fluid collection.
3. Consult with neurology and neurosurgery to discuss the possibility of burr hole procedure and evacuation of the fluid collection.
4. Consider repeating the EEG to assess the patient's seizure activity and potential for further treatment.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ESRD on hemodialysis.
6. Discuss goals of care with the patient's family and consider palliative care consultation.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral nutrition support if necessary.
8. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a subdural hemorrhage, dementia, and malnutrition. The patient has had a seizure and is at risk for further seizures. The patient has a large fluid collection in the left frontoparietal area, which may be a subdural hygroma containing CSF and hemorrhagic elements. The patient has a history of allergies, including iodine, aspirin, and NSAIDs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient has had a seizure and is at risk for further seizures. The patient's EEG showed focal seizure activity, and the neurology team recommended dilantin loading prior to the burr hole procedure. The patient's dilantin level was 17.7, which is above the therapeutic range. Further seizures could lead to increased intracranial pressure, brain damage, and even death.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and the CXR shows retrocardiac opacification, which may represent atelectasis and pleural effusion. The patient's low-grade fevers and the need for UA and UCx suggest that the patient may have an underlying infection.
3. Malnutrition: The patient has malnutrition, which can lead to decreased immune function, increased risk of infection, and impaired wound healing.
4. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, brain damage, and even death. The patient's fluid collection in the left frontoparietal area may be causing mass effect and may need to be drained.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT, especially given the patient's immobility and history of stroke.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer, especially given the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the need for prophylaxis.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP, especially given the patient's history of pneumonia and the need for prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including seizures, infection, malnutrition, subdural hemorrhage, DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage these risks aggressively to prevent further complications."

   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in pt with ESRD
   and elderly but concerning for worsening intracranial process.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
   - If doesn

   - Get stat head CT this am to reassess worsening fluid collection in
   head and see if any herniation
   - Get repeat ABG this am
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,

   24 Hour Events:
   - EEG showed focal seizure activity, so neurology consulted.  They gave
   ativan with some correction of seizure activity and recommended
   dilantin loading prior to expected burr hole procedure.
   - 5pm dilantin level 17.7, which with albumin of 3.3 and low Cr
   clearance corrects to level of 41.2.  Will not give further dilantin
   tonight and reassess with neuro in AM.
   - Family gave consent to neurosurg for procedure, but were worried when
   anesthesia explained that he may be difficult to extubate.
   - Per nursing, has basically been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub
   since ativan and dilantin

   FINDINGS: There is a new large 2.5 cm fluid collection in a lentiform
   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.

   - Get stat head CT this am to reassess worsening fluid collection in
   head and see if any herniation
   - Get repeat ABG this am
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,
   however apparently they were hesitant after speaking anesthesia
   - F/u with family about whether they want to do the NSurg procedure
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presented with a syncopal episode and was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. He has been unresponsive since receiving Ativan and Dilantin, and his condition is concerning for worsening intracranial process. He has a history of malnutrition, dementia, and subdural hemorrhage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening intracranial process: The patient's unresponsiveness and new left-sided fluid collection on head CT are concerning for worsening intracranial process, which may lead to herniation, brainstem compression, or other neurological complications.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure or other neurological complications, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and suspicious opacity on CXR may indicate an underlying infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may exacerbate his underlying conditions and increase his risk of complications, such as infections, pressure ulcers, and poor wound healing.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may lead to confusion, disorientation, and difficulty with communication, which may complicate his care and treatment.
6. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient's subdural hemorrhage may lead to increased intracranial pressure, brainstem compression, or other neurological complications, which may require further treatment and monitoring.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and intracranial pressure.
2. Consider further imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, to better evaluate the patient's intracranial process.
3. Continue to manage the patient's seizures with Ativan and Dilantin, and consider further anticonvulsant therapy if necessary.
4. Investigate the patient's low-grade fevers and suspicious opacity on CXR with further imaging studies and laboratory tests.
5. Continue to manage the patient's malnutrition with nutrition support and consider further interventions, such as enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition, if necessary.
6. Consider further treatment and management for the patient's dementia, such as medication or behavioral interventions.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further treatment if necessary.
8. Consider further treatment and management for the patient's subdural hemorrhage, such as surgical evacuation or medical management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old man with a subdural hematoma (SDH) and midline shift, who has declined in mental status and worsened encephalopathy. He is on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 142/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG of pH 7.31.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin individual with normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular exams. He has non-purposive movement and normal tone, but responds to noxious stimuli. His skin is warm, and he has no extremity edema.

Laboratory results show the following:

* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL (increased from 8.1 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 220 K/uL (decreased from 299 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL (increased from 4.0 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 145 mg/dL
* Glucose: 95 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show no new findings.

The assessment and plan include:

* Surgical drainage of the SDH
* Review of antiepileptic medication dosing with neurology
* Monitoring of ABG and VBG to exclude hypercarbia
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis due to intracranial process and ESRD
* Review of AED dosing with neurology
* Renal follow-up

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Seizure activity, which has already been noted
* Increased intracranial pressure, which may worsen the patient's condition
* Hypercarbia, which may worsen the patient's encephalopathy
* Stress ulcers, which may lead to bleeding and hemorrhage
* Renal dysfunction, which may worsen the patient's ESRD
* Infection, which may worsen the patient's condition and lead to sepsis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presents with altered mental status, syncopal episode, and a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT.

The patient is currently unresponsive to voice or sternal rub, with pupils that constrict to light. He has periods of apnea and poor to fair air movement in the lungs. His abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Lab results show:

* WBC: 6.4, 8.1, 10.2
* Hct: 35.8, 35.8, 35.3
* Plt: 220, 299, 312

The patient has a pending urine culture and blood culture.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Unresponsiveness: likely due to Ativan and Dilantin, but concerning for worsening intracranial process.
2. Left-sided intracranial fluid collection: unclear chronicity, but the patient has been having a significant decline over the past couple of months. The family has discussed burr hole and evacuation with neurosurgery, but anesthesia has expressed hesitation.
3. Seizure activity: given Ativan and Dilantin, and is now unresponsive. The patient will need to be followed up with Neurology regarding medication regimen for prophylaxis/treatment.
4. Low-grade fevers: no clear signs of infection, but with suspicious opacity on CXR. Repeat CXR, UA, and UCx are needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Worsening intracranial process, including herniation, if the fluid collection is not evacuated.
* Seizure activity, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
* Infection, including pneumonia, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying conditions.
* Malnutrition and failure to thrive, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
* Hypertension, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.
* Hyperlipidemia, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family has discussed not wanting heroic measures. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive, presents with altered mental status, tachypnea, and a left-sided intracranial fluid collection. The patient was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT and was drained yesterday. The patient's condition is concerning for worsening intracranial process, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Intracranial Process: The patient's altered mental status, tachypnea, and left-sided intracranial fluid collection suggest a worsening intracranial process, which may lead to further decline in his condition.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient's history of seizures and current unresponsiveness raise concerns about potential seizure activity, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and failure to thrive increases his risk of developing further complications, such as infections and poor wound healing.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive may indicate a need for further evaluation and management of his blood pressure.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. ESRD on Hemodialysis: The patient's history of ESRD on hemodialysis may increase his risk of developing complications related to dialysis, such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
7. Dementia: The patient's history of dementia may increase his risk of developing further cognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, and other complications related to dementia.

Recommendations:

1. Further evaluation of the patient's intracranial process, including a head CT scan, to determine the cause of his symptoms.
2. Management of the patient's seizures, including further evaluation and management of his seizure medication.
3. Monitoring of the patient's nutritional status, including assessment of his nutritional needs and provision of appropriate nutrition therapy.
4. Evaluation and management of the patient's hypertension, including further evaluation and management of his blood pressure.
5. Monitoring of the patient's hyperlipidemia, including assessment of his lipid levels and provision of appropriate therapy.
6. Evaluation and management of the patient's ESRD on hemodialysis, including further evaluation and management of his dialysis regimen.
7. Evaluation and management of the patient's dementia, including further evaluation and management of his cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances."
