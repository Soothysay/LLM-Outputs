You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including ESRD, failed cadaveric renal transplant, CAD, dCHF, and hx PE. She was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis in the setting of HD. The patient developed pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, and was intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated, on invasive ventilation, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 304, indicating severe hypoxia.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 148/51 mmHg, and a heart rate of 99 bpm.
* Neurological: Sedated, minimally responsive to sound.
* Renal: On HD, with a creatinine of 6.3 mg/dL and a BUN of 25 mEq/L.
* Hematological: WBC count of 16.0, Hct of 32.5%, and platelet count of 197.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and a suspected source of infection (line infection, pneumonia, or C. diff).
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe hypoxia and is intubated, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, dCHF, and PE, and is currently hypotensive, increasing the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is on HD, increasing the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or septicemia.
5. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and minimally responsive to sound, increasing the risk of neurological complications such as cerebral edema or seizures.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. IVF to maintain blood pressure.
2. Heparin to prevent DVT.
3. Vanc, Zosyn, and Flagyl for sepsis.
4. Daily CXR to monitor for pneumonia.
5. Follow-up blood and sputum culture data.
6. Stool studies to rule out C. diff.
7. HD on MWF to manage ESRD.
8. Nephrocaps, cinacalcet, and epo with HD to manage ESRD.
9. Low-dose prednisone to manage dCHF.
10. Holding ACEI and BB in setting of sepsis.
11. Heparin and SCD to manage PE and SVC thrombus.
12. Lytes per HD and NPO to manage electrolyte imbalance.
13. PPI and bowel regimen to manage gastric acid reflux.
14. PIV, HD line, and A-line for access.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], wishes to pull line today and HD at another time
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   - ABG q8h, change vent settings as needed
   - CXR
   # Demand ischemia: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin-t, cardiology consulted-they  rec ASA,
   metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin. Pt initially remained on those meds
   through the night.
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - d/c heparin due to IR procedure
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place. Pt culture S. aureus from line.
   - Renal consulted
 pull line in IR
   - Temp line for HD in future
   - Levophed for hypotension
   - vanc, zosyn, Day 2
   - stool negative, d/c flagyl and azithromycin
   - CXR
   - follow up cultures
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal
   consulted.
   - IR will pull line, FFP to correct INR
   - No HD today per renal
   - Will need temp line placed for HD MWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   - will restart when pressures stable
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin (held for IR procedure).
   - Heparin (currently held for IR procedure)
   - SCD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], wishes to pull line today and HD at another time
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   - ABG q8h, change vent settings as needed
   - CXR
   # Demand ischemia: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin-t, cardiology consulted-they  rec ASA,
   metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin. Pt initially remained on those meds
   through the night.
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - d/c heparin due to IR procedure
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place. Pt culture S. aureus from line.
   - Renal consulted
 pull line in IR
   - Temp line for HD in future
   - Levophed for hypotension
   - vanc, zosyn, Day 2
   - stool negative, d/c flagyl and azithromycin
   - CXR
   - follow up cultures
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal
   consulted.
   - IR will pull line, FFP to correct INR
   - No HD today per renal
   - Will need temp line placed for HD MWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   - will restart when pressures stable
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin (held for IR procedure).
   - Heparin (currently held for IR procedure)
   - SCD
   # FEN: lytes per HD, kayexelate if needed, NPO
   # PPX: PPI, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV, multilumen in groin, HD line, A-line

Based on the patient's progress note, I have summarized the key information as follows:

**Chief Complaint**: The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors. She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis.

**24-Hour Events**:

* New regional wall motion abnormality in the mid to distal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution with decreased ejection fraction (EF), troponin-T 1.10, and CK-MB index 2.9.
* Increasing shortness of breath (SOB), anxiety, and hypoxia, leading to intubation.
* Cardiology consultation agreed with current treatment.
* Renal consultation for line sepsis and consideration of infected thrombus, influenza, viral syndrome, UTI, and osteo.

**Assessment and Plan**:

* Type I/Type VI respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and sepsis.
* Demand ischemia with intermittent chest pain and increased troponin-T.
* Sepsis meeting SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and line infection.
* Considerations include pneumonia, C. diff, infected thrombus, influenza, viral syndrome, UTI, and osteo.

**Potential Medical Complications**:

1. **Sepsis**: The patient is at risk for further sepsis progression, organ dysfunction, and mortality.
2. **Pulmonary Edema**: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential ARDS.
3. **Cardiac Complications**: The patient's demand ischemia may lead to further cardiac compromise, including myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
4. **Renal Complications**: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential renal failure.
5. **Infectious Complications**: The patient is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia, C. diff, and UTI.
6. **Thrombotic Complications**: The patient's history of PE and SVC thrombus may increase her risk for further thrombotic events.
7. **Metabolic Complications**: The patient's DM may worsen, leading to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or other metabolic derangements.

**Recommendations**:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider further imaging studies, such as echocardiogram or CT scan, to evaluate the patient's cardiac and pulmonary status.
3. Adjust the patient's antibiotics and antifungal therapy as necessary based on culture results and clinical response.
4. Consider further interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy or mechanical thrombectomy, to address the patient's thrombotic risk.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte and acid-base status closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Consider further consultation with cardiology, nephrology, and infectious disease specialists to optimize the patient's care."

   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Currently maintaining PA02 in mid
   70s.
   Consider d/c sedation, eval if breath spontaneously on just pressure
   support. Bolus versed as needed.
   ABG: Q6H.
   CXR: unchanged: stable retrocardiac opacity, interstitial markings.
   Volume Overload:
   48 hour line holiday eith nexy hemodialysis on Thursday. Needs IR
   guided temporary line placement.
   Labile BPs: HTN occurred with procedure (tube placement, moving).
   Currently on levophed. Hold for MAP < 58, systolic < 110. BP will
   likely increase given no dialysis till Thursday and d/c levophed.
   Demand ischemia: Elevated troponins, stable CK-MB, pattern consistent
   with demand ischemia. Continue daily EKGs, tele, ASA, metoprolol,
   atorvastatin.
   ERSD: s/p failed kidney transplant, usually gets HD: MWF will get [**Last Name (un) **]
   this week.
   Continue low dose steroids, epo with HD.
   Taking meds by NGT therefore changed nephrocaps to MTV/ folate.
   Consider lytes today, no HD.
   Hx: PE/SVC: warfarin held for IR procedure. Continue follow INR.
   DM: stable: continue GFS, NPH/HISS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Currently maintaining PA02 in mid
   70s.
   Consider d/c sedation, eval if breath spontaneously on just pressure
   support. Bolus versed as needed.
   ABG: Q6H.
   CXR: unchanged: stable retrocardiac opacity, interstitial markings.
   Volume Overload:
   48 hour line holiday eith nexy hemodialysis on Thursday. Needs IR
   guided temporary line placement.
   Labile BPs: HTN occurred with procedure (tube placement, moving).
   Currently on levophed. Hold for MAP < 58, systolic < 110. BP will
   likely increase given no dialysis till Thursday and d/c levophed.
   Demand ischemia: Elevated troponins, stable CK-MB, pattern consistent
   with demand ischemia. Continue daily EKGs, tele, ASA, metoprolol,
   atorvastatin.
   ERSD: s/p failed kidney transplant, usually gets HD: MWF will get [**Last Name (un) **]
   this week.
   Continue low dose steroids, epo with HD.
   Taking meds by NGT therefore changed nephrocaps to MTV/ folate.
   Consider lytes today, no HD.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with ESRD who has undergone failed cadaveric renal transplantation and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis. The patient developed pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory failure, and was intubated.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 74 bpm (65-85 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/38 mmHg (60/49-187/50 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (13-26 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 31.9%
* Platelet count: 192 K/uL
* Creatinine: 6.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.10 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* LDH: 456 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.2 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: The patient is maintaining a PaO2 in the mid-70s, and consideration is being given to discontinuing sedation and evaluating the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously on pressure support.
* Volume overload: The patient is at risk for volume overload due to the lack of dialysis, and a 48-hour line holiday with next hemodialysis scheduled for Thursday is planned.
* Labile blood pressures: The patient's blood pressures are labile, and levophed is being used to manage hypertension. The plan is to hold levophed for a MAP < 58 mmHg or systolic < 110 mmHg.
* Demand ischemia: The patient's troponins are elevated, but the CK-MB is stable, suggesting demand ischemia. Daily EKGs, tele, ASA, metoprolol, and atorvastatin are being continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Volume overload: The patient's lack of dialysis puts them at risk for volume overload, which could lead to cardiac compromise.
* Labile blood pressures: The patient's blood pressures are labile, and further hypertension could lead to cardiac complications.
* Demand ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia could lead to further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Dialysis access complications: The patient's lack of dialysis access could lead to complications such as access site infection or bleeding.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and demand ischemia make them at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], wishes to pull line today and HD at another time
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   - ABG q8h, change vent settings as needed
   - CXR
   # Demand ischemia: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin-t, cardiology consulted-they  rec ASA,
   metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin. Pt initially remained on those meds
   through the night.
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - d/c heparin due to IR procedure
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place. Pt culture S. aureus from line.
   - Renal consulted
 pull line in IR
   - Temp line for HD in future
   - Levophed for hypotension
   - vanc, zosyn, Day 2
   - stool negative, d/c flagyl and azithromycin
   - CXR
   - follow up cultures
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal
   consulted.
   - IR will pull line, FFP to correct INR
   - No HD today per renal
   - Will need temp line placed for HD MWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   - will restart when pressures stable
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin (held for IR procedure).
   - Heparin (currently held for IR procedure)
   - SCD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], wishes to pull line today and HD at another time
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   - ABG q8h, change vent settings as needed
   - CXR
   # Demand ischemia: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin-t, cardiology consulted-they  rec ASA,
   metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin. Pt initially remained on those meds
   through the night.
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - d/c heparin due to IR procedure
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place. Pt culture S. aureus from line.
   - Renal consulted
 pull line in IR
   - Temp line for HD in future
   - Levophed for hypotension
   - vanc, zosyn, Day 2
   - stool negative, d/c flagyl and azithromycin
   - CXR
   - follow up cultures
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal
   consulted.
   - IR will pull line, FFP to correct INR
   - No HD today per renal
   - Will need temp line placed for HD MWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   - will restart when pressures stable
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin (held for IR procedure).
   - Heparin (currently held for IR procedure)
   - SCD
   # FEN: lytes per HD, kayexelate if needed, NPO

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with ESRD, s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis in the setting of HD. The patient developed pulm edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.6°C (99.7°F), HR 74 bpm, BP 118/38 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Respiratory support: Intubated, ventilator mode CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, Vt 500 mL, RR 14, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAPS to low 60s, recovered on own.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
2. Demand ischemia: The patient's intermittent chest pain, increased troponin-T levels, and cardiology consultation suggest demand ischemia.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.
4. ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant: The patient receives HD on MWF and has a history of failed kidney transplant.
5. dCHF: The patient has a history of dCHF and is currently holding ACEI and BB due to sepsis.
6. PE, SVC thrombus: The patient has a history of PE and SVC thrombus.
7. FEN: The patient has a history of FEN and is currently receiving HD.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Intubation and mechanical ventilation to support respiratory failure.
2. Renal consultation to pull line, FFP to correct INR, and temp line placement for HD.
3. Antibiotic therapy with vanc and zosyn.
4. Sedation with fentanyl and versed.
5. ABG q8h and change vent settings as needed.
6. CXR to monitor for pulmonary complications.
7. Follow-up cultures to monitor for sepsis.
8. Continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet, and epo with HD.
9. Continue low-dose prednisone.
10. Restart ACEI and BB when pressures are stable.
11. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis.
12. Monitor for DVT and VAP.
13. Continue glycemic control with NPH and HISS.
14. Monitor for diarrhea and fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include:

1. Development of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VTach) with perfusion, which was treated with sedation and returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).
2. Echocardiogram (TEE) showed no vegetations.
3. Trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) led to tachypnea, and was switched back to assist-control (AC) ventilation.
4. Antibiotics were changed to Nafcillin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis.
5. Temporary femoral hemodialysis (HD) line was placed for chronic kidney disease (CKD) management.
6. Ogilvie's syndrome (constipation) was treated with tube feeding (TF) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
7. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Sustained VTach with perfusion
	* Cardiac ischemia
	* Cardiac failure
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pulmonary edema
	* Respiratory failure
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Renal complications:
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Dialysis-related complications
4. Infectious complications:
	* Sepsis
	* MSSA bacteremia
	* Line sepsis
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Constipation
	* Diarrhea
6. Hemodynamic complications:
	* Hypotension
	* Shock
7. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia
	* Electrolyte imbalance

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic status.
2. Maintenance of sedation with fentanyl and versed.
3. Monitoring of respiratory status and adjusting ventilation as needed.
4. Management of renal failure with hemodialysis and fluid restriction.
5. Antibiotic therapy for MSSA sepsis.
6. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.
7. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and blood glucose.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD), and has undergone failed cadaveric renal transplantation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Ventricular tachycardia (VTach) with perfusion, which is potentially due to cardiac ischemia
* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with unstable angina and coronary ischemia
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
* Chronic renal failure (CRF) with ESRD
* Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC)
* Vascular device infection (not central or arterial line, including graft, fistula)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS))
* Pulmonary edema
* Diarrhea
* Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

The patient has been treated with the following medications:

* Heparin drip
* Plavix 75mg PO QD
* Lidocaine drip
* Cardiac medications (unspecified)
* Enoxaparin
* Aspirin
* Nafcillin
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Levophed
* Regular insulin sliding scale
* H2 blocker
* Prophylactic antibiotics (unspecified)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.2-17.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.8-10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 196-252 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 8.6-10.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28-30 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), and phosphorus (PO4) within normal limits
* Troponin-T: 1.97-2.30 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 274 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 4.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 7.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): OG tube in place
* ECG: NSR, significant T-wave inversions V2-V6

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotic therapy with Nafcillin
* Monitor for cardiac dysrhythmias and adjust sedation as needed
* Maintain respiratory support with assisted ventilation
* Continue renal replacement therapy with temporary femoral HD catheter
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker
* Monitor for signs of DVT and adjust prophylaxis as needed
* Continue low-dose steroids and EPO therapy
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and adjust ventilation as needed

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia
* Cardiac ischemia or infarction
* Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Vascular device infection or line sepsis
* Pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Diarrhea or gastrointestinal bleeding
* Fever or hypothermia
* Hypotension or shock
* Dyspnea or shortness of breath"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   #Cardiac ischemia- patient perfusing well, has very irregular and
   multiple heart rhythms. Lidocaine was started yesterday for VTach and
   d/c yesterday. A heparin drip was also started, then held for
   increasing INR and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted.
   Original plan was to take to cath lab for T-wave changes, however,
   increased INR so they cancelled. CE continue to be elevated.
   - D/C heparin drip
   - Restart beta blocker when pressures can tolerate
   - Cont ASA
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Appreciate cards recs
   - CE, EKG
   #Abdominal pain- Patient with abdominal pain, may be source of
   worsening clinical picture/infection
   - CT torso with contrast
   - consider adding Flagyl source detected. On meropenem currently.
   #Coagulation: The patient had an increase in INR throughout the day
   yesterday. DIC negative. Heme-onc consulted and likely [**12-26**] VitK
   deficiency. Gave IV vitK. Pt also received FFP and CVVH which appear to
   have brought INR into normal range 1.2 this am.
   - Continue to monitor - [**Hospital1 **] coags
   # Respiratory failure: fluid overload vs septic physiology. On
   CMV/Assist. Likely a few days from extubation.
   - Continue to monitor ABG q6h, adjust vent settings as needed
   - Continue with intubation, consider PS
   - Continue to dialyze fluid off
   - maintain sedation with fentanyl/versed
   #Renal Failure: ESRD s/p renal txp.  Temp HD cath placed
   - CVVH last night
   - Renal recs - CVVH vs HD today
   - Cont low dose steroids and EPO
   #Sepsis: Likely MSSA line sepsis. Coverage expanded yesterday.
   Nafcillin d/ced. WBC 9.6.
   - Cont vanc and meropenem, treat for 72 days, if cultures negative and
   CT negative consider d/c and restart nafcillin
   - Daily blood cultures
   - Off pressors
   - Follow Ucx, blood cx
   - Appreciate ID recs
   # Hypotension: Off pressors, currently normotensive.
   #DM: controlled
   - continue NPH/HISS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of line sepsis, cardiac ischemia, and respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including a failed cadaveric renal transplant, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: The patient has a history of cardiac ischemia and has developed ventricular tachycardia, which was treated with lidocaine. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she is being monitored for cardiac complications.
* Respiratory: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is intubated. She is being treated with mechanical ventilation and is likely to be extubated in a few days.
* Renal: The patient has chronic renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis. She has a temporary dialysis catheter in place.
* Sepsis: The patient has a suspected line sepsis, which is being treated with antibiotics.
* Abdominal pain: The patient has abdominal pain, which may be related to the line sepsis or a separate infection.
* Coagulation: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an increased international normalized ratio (INR). This is being treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
* Fever: The patient has a fever, which is being treated with antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged intubation or mechanical ventilation
* Renal failure, which could lead to further deterioration of the patient's kidney function
* Sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction or failure
* Abdominal infection, which could lead to peritonitis or abscess formation
* Coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications
* Fever, which could lead to further infection or organ dysfunction

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Cardiovascular support, including beta blockers and anticoagulation therapy
* Respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Renal support, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis
* Antibiotic therapy for line sepsis and suspected abdominal infection
* Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to correct coagulopathy
* Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac, respiratory, and renal function to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   #Cardiac ischemia- patient perfusing well, has very irregular and
   multiple heart rhythms. Lidocaine was started yesterday for VTach and
   d/c yesterday. A heparin drip was also started, then held for
   increasing INR and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted.
   Original plan was to take to cath lab for T-wave changes, however,
   increased INR so they cancelled. CE continue to be elevated.
   - Restarted Heparin drip, continue
   - Restart beta blocker when pressures can tolerate
   - Cont ASA
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Appreciate cards recs
   - CE, EKG
   #Coagulation: The patient had an increase in INR throughout the day
   yesterday. DIC negative. Heme-onc consulted and likely [**12-26**] VitK
   deficiency. Gave IV vitK. Pt also received FFP and CVVH which appear to
   have brought INR into normal range 1.2 this am.
   - Restart heparin drip to PTT goal of 60
   - Continue to monitor - [**Hospital1 **] coags
   # Respiratory failure: fluid overload vs septic physiology. On
   CMV/Assist
   - Continue to monitor ABG q6h, adjust vent settings as needed
   - Continue with intubation, consider SBT if tolerates wean of sedation
   - Continue to dialyze fluid off
   -maintain sedation with fentanyl/versed
   #Renal Failure: ESRD s/p renal txp.  Temp HD cath placed
   - CVVH last night
   - HD today
   - Renal recs
   - Cont low dose steroids and EPO
   #Sepsis: Likely MSSA line sepsis. Coverage expanded yesterday.
   Nafcillin d/ced. WBC 9.6.
   - Cont vanc and meropenem, get ID recs for course duration
   - Daily blood cultures
   - Off pressors
   - Follow Ucx, blood cx
   - Follow ID recs
   # Hypotension: Off pressors, currently normotensive.
   #DM: controlled
   - continue NPH/HISS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Cardiac ischemia- patient perfusing well, has very irregular and
   multiple heart rhythms. Lidocaine was started yesterday for VTach and
   d/c yesterday. A heparin drip was also started, then held for
   increasing INR and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted.
   Original plan was to take to cath lab for T-wave changes, however,
   increased INR so they cancelled. CE continue to be elevated.
   - Restarted Heparin drip, continue

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, and respiratory failure. She had a recent admission for line sepsis and has a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated. She has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and has been started on a heparin drip. The patient's cardiac status is unstable, with irregular and multiple heart rhythms, and she has been restarted on a beta blocker. Her coagulation status has been abnormal, with an elevated INR, but has been brought into normal range with the administration of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of further cardiac ischemia or infarction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of septic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis, and there is a risk of further renal deterioration or failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is abnormal, and there is a risk of further bleeding or thrombotic events.
6. Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of bacteremia and vascular device infection, and there is a risk of further infection or development of sepsis.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of ARDS.
8. Hypotension: The patient has been treated with vasopressors and has been normotensive, but there is a risk of further hypotension or shock.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is abnormal, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or development of neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a diagnosis of diarrhea, and there is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.

ICU Care:

The patient requires continued ICU care, including close monitoring of her cardiac, respiratory, and renal status. She should be treated with antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as needed. Her coagulation status should be monitored closely, and she should be restarted on a beta blocker as soon as possible. She should also be treated with stress ulcer prophylaxis and stress ulcer prevention medication as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with ESRD, CAD, and dCHF, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis. The patient has a history of failed cadaveric renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.1°C, Heart rate 97 bpm, Blood pressure 125/54 mmHg, Respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, Oxygen saturation 99%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient has chronic renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has diarrhea and is receiving lactulose and tube feeds.
* Infections: The patient has sepsis and bacteremia, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 9.6, hematocrit is 25.8, and platelet count is 266 K/uL. The patient's creatinine is 11.4 mg/dL, and her troponin-T is 2.28 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis and bacteremia can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
* Chronic renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
* Respiratory failure can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular instability can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea and malnutrition, can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
* Infections can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Hemodialysis to manage chronic renal failure
* Antibiotics to treat sepsis and bacteremia
* Vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function
* Tube feeds and lactulose to manage gastrointestinal symptoms
* Monitoring for electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia
* Monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock
* Monitoring for respiratory failure, hypoxia, and hypercapnia

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent and treat potential complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed
   cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF,
   hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is
   transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the
   setting of HD.
   24 Hour Events:
   CT scan showed gall bladder distension, edema likely secondary to
   fluids given. To rule out cholecystitis, HIDA recommended.
   Head CT: multifocal old infarcts with encephalomalacia.
   f/u final read CT chest, abd, pelvis.
   Renal will change dialysate, dialysis regimen coz getting clots in
   filter. Cards anticipates TWI will persist, likely [**12-26**] demand ischemia
   DD includes strain vs ischemia vs metabolic.
   Has been afebrile, dipped BP earlier in day, restarted on neo,
   normotensive now on neo with MAPS in 70s. Trying to wean neo so can
   restart HD tomorrow as not taking off enough with CVVH.
   Currently on CVVH. Discuss with renal desire to restart HD tomorrow
   take off more fluid if can wean off levophed.
   PM ABG:7.37/37/137/22 lactate 0.9 -stable.
   7.38/33/129/20 -lactate 0.9- stable.
   High residuals to 250s, getting lactulose, restarting tube feeds with

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure (CHF). She was recently admitted to the ICU for line sepsis and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

* She has a sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia.
* She has acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with unstable angina and coronary ischemia, which may require further cardiac interventions.
* She has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which is likely related to a line sepsis.
* She has bacteremia, which is likely caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
* She has chronic renal failure, which is exacerbated by her acute kidney injury from CVVH.
* She has superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), which may be related to her central venous catheter.
* She has a vascular device infection, which is likely related to her dialysis catheter.
* She has respiratory failure, acute, which is likely related to fluid overload and septic physiology.
* She has pulmonary edema, which is likely related to her acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* She has diarrhea, which may be related to her gastrointestinal dysfunction.
* She has fever, which is likely related to her sepsis.
* She has hypotension, which may be related to her septic shock.

The plan for the patient's care is as follows:

* Bleeding: The patient has no history of trauma, but has had an ogastric tube (OG) and endotracheal tube (ETT) for several days. The patient's bleeding risk is likely related to her coagulopathy and may require further evaluation and management.
* Coagulation: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is stable at 1.2, but will need to be closely monitored.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) assist, but may require further interventions to improve her respiratory function.
* Hypo/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, but is currently normotensive. Further management of her blood pressure may require adjustments to her vasopressors and fluids.
* Resp alkalosis: The patient's respiratory alkalosis may require further management to correct her overbreathing on the ventilator.
* Q: Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely related to MSSA line sepsis, and will require continued antibiotics and close monitoring.
* DM: The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is controlled with NPH and ISS, but will require close monitoring and adjustments to her insulin regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Ventricular tachycardia-related cardiac arrest
* ACS-related cardiac complications
* Respiratory failure-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Pulmonary edema-related respiratory failure
* Diarrhea-related gastrointestinal complications
* Fever-related septic shock
* Hypotension-related septic shock
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding complications

The patient's current medications include:

* Nafcillin
* Vancomycin
* Meropenem
* Fentanyl
* Calcium gluconate
* Heparin sodium
* Midazolam
* KCl
* Dextrose 50%
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* D5
* Lactulose
* Tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to sepsis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 151/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line (AL) in place. She has been receiving meropenem and vancomycin for suspected MSSA line sepsis. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 15.1 K/μL, and her C-reactive protein (CRP) is increased.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a recent episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ongoing cardiac ischemia. Her troponin-T level is elevated at 2.30 ng/mL, indicating possible myocardial infarction.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and a requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV). Her partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 417 mmHg, indicating adequate oxygenation.

The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to cholecystitis, and a HIDA scan is planned to assess the severity of the condition. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, indicating chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: ongoing cardiac ischemia, VT, and possible myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: ARF, MV, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal complications: CKD, acute kidney injury (AKI), and possible need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
4. Infectious complications: sepsis, line sepsis, and possible bloodstream infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: cholecystitis, possible gallbladder perforation, and possible need for surgical intervention.
6. Hematological complications: possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), bleeding, and possible need for blood transfusions.
7. Neurological complications: possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), rhabdomyolysis, and possible need for sedation and analgesia.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and management by the ICU team, including:

1. Cardiac monitoring and treatment of cardiac ischemia.
2. Respiratory support and management of ARF.
3. Renal replacement therapy and management of CKD.
4. Antibiotic therapy and management of sepsis and line sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal management and possible surgical intervention.
6. Hematological monitoring and treatment of possible DIC.
7. Neurological monitoring and management of possible NMS and rhabdomyolysis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The 67-year-old female patient with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac ischemia. She was admitted with fevers, rigors, and hypotension, and was intubated due to pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis with suspected MSSA line sepsis, treated with meropenem and vancomycin.
2. Respiratory failure, intubated, and on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
3. Cardiac ischemia, with multiple abnormal heart rhythms, including ventricular tachycardia.
4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, and coronary ischemia.
5. Chronic renal failure (CRF), with ESRD and a temporary hemodialysis (HD) line.
6. Diarrhea.
7. Hypotension, currently normotensive.
8. Dyspnea (shortness of breath).
9. Abdominal pain, with suspected cholecystitis and potential percutaneous drainage.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis or medication reaction.
2. Elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac ischemia.
3. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), including elevated ALT and AST levels.
4. Abnormal blood chemistry tests, including elevated lactate levels and decreased albumin levels.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to monitor ABG and ventilator settings.
2. Consider PSV trials and CVVH negative as BP tolerates.
3. Maintain sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
4. Restart beta blocker when pressures can tolerate.
5. Continue CVVH to take off fluid.
6. F/u cardiology recommendations.
7. Discontinue Plavix and continue beta blocker.
8. Consider percutaneous drainage for cholecystitis.
9. Continue to trend CK levels and monitor for signs of rigidity or ongoing fever.
10. Monitor coagulation parameters and consider further therapy if necessary.
11. Continue CVVH to run negative 1 L.
12. F/u renal recommendations.
13. Contemplate discontinuing antibiotics if cultures are negative and CT scans are negative.
14. Monitor blood cultures and follow ID recommendations.
15. Continue to monitor hypotension and adjust therapy as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiac ischemia, including myocardial infarction.
4. Chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Hemorrhagic complications due to coagulopathy.
6. Infection-related complications, including bacteremia and sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, including protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia.
9. Cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with ESRD, is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of failed cadaveric renal transplantation, line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, and PE. The patient developed pulmonary edema, which led to respiratory failure, and was transferred to the MICU for further management.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including:

1. Percutaneous drain insertion for cholecystitis, which showed an abnormal HIDA scan.
2. Administration of meropenem and vancomycin for suspected MSSA line sepsis.
3. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) for chronic kidney disease.
4. Temporary HD line placement.
5. Insertion of a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure due to fluid overload and septic physiology.
2. Cholecystitis with a suspected MSSA infection.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.
4. Chronic kidney disease.
5. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC).
6. Vascular device infection.
7. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
8. Hypotension.
9. Dyspnea.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated WBC count (15.1) and trending down.
2. Elevated creatinine (2.6) and blood urea nitrogen (114) levels.
3. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated ALT (44) and AST (89) levels.
4. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (343 IU/L) and troponin-T (2.30) levels.

The patient's medications include:

1. Fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
2. Meropenem and vancomycin for septicemia.
3. Heparin for SVC obstruction and DVT prophylaxis.
4. Aspirin for cardiac ischemia.
5. Beta blockers for cardiac ischemia.
6. Statin for hyperlipidemia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure due to septic physiology.
2. Cholecystitis with a suspected MSSA infection.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.
4. Chronic kidney disease.
5. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC).
6. Vascular device infection.
7. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
8. Hypotension.
9. Dyspnea.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, I recommend the following:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean sedation.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
3. Continue meropenem and vancomycin for septicemia.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust medication dosages as needed.
5. Continue heparin for SVC obstruction and DVT prophylaxis.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust beta blocker dosages as needed.
7. Continue statin for hyperlipidemia.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust insulin dosages as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with ESRD, s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is currently in the MICU due to hypotension and concern for sepsis. The patient developed pulm edema leading to respiratory failure and is intubated.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving CMV/Assist ventilation. The possibility of fluid overload vs septic physiology is being considered.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient has an abnormal HIDA scan and a CT scan showing an enlarged gallbladder with thickened walls. Percutaneous drainage was placed, and cultures are pending.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from MSSA line sepsis, and is receiving meropenem and vancomycin.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires intermittent use of phenylephrine and has had occasional episodes of hypotension.
5. Cardiac ischemia/Vtach: The patient has had episodes of Vtach, which have resolved. The patient is being monitored for cardiac ischemia and is receiving beta blockers and ASA.
6. Elevated CK: The patient has had an acute increase in CK, possibly due to NMS, rhabdo, or a medication reaction.
7. Coagulation: The patient had an increase in INR, which has been brought into normal range with IV vitK and FFP.
8. CRI: The patient has ESRD and is receiving temporary HD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory compromise or failure if not properly ventilated.
2. Sepsis: The patient may experience worsening sepsis or septic shock if not properly treated.
3. Cardiac ischemia/Vtach: The patient may experience further cardiac compromise or arrhythmias if not properly monitored and treated.
4. Coagulation disorders: The patient may experience further bleeding or thrombosis if not properly monitored and treated.
5. CRI: The patient may experience further kidney damage or failure if not properly treated.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and treatment for her various conditions. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and the potential risks and complications that may arise."

   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 67 y/o female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal on
   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile
   .
   She was being treated with heparin for her SVC, with PTT in the 150s
   developed spontaneous bleeding everywhere
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.
   Vanc dose given post HD.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who was admitted with line sepsis, hypotension, and demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain. She has not grown any organisms from her bile cultures. The patient was being treated with heparin for her Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding due to a prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of 150s. The bleeding was stopped by holding the heparin and reversing the PTT to 26.7. The patient is currently on propofol drip for sedation and is receiving vancomycin for possible MSSA line sepsis/cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her line sepsis and potential bacterial infections.
2. Bacterial Infection: The patient has not grown any organisms from her bile cultures, but it is possible that she may have a bacterial infection elsewhere in her body.
3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's EKG changes and abdominal pain may indicate ACS, which could be a life-threatening condition.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and may be at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's bleeding may be due to her ESRD and could be exacerbated by her line sepsis.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen due to her line sepsis and potential bacterial infections.
7. SVC Syndrome: The patient's SVC syndrome may worsen due to her line sepsis and potential bacterial infections.
8. Vascular Device Infection: The patient's line sepsis may be due to a vascular device infection, which could be a life-threatening condition.
9. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis may worsen due to her line sepsis and potential bacterial infections.
10. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to her line sepsis and potential bacterial infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider restarting heparin or lovenox for SVC treatment.
3. Continue to administer vancomycin for possible MSSA line sepsis/cholecystitis.
4. Consider adding antibiotics for possible bacterial infections.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting her dialysis schedule as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to determine the best course of treatment for the patient's line sepsis and potential bacterial infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 67 y/o female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal on
   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile
   .
   She was being treated with heparin for her SVC, with PTT in the 150s
   developed spontaneous bleeding everywhere
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.
   Vanc dose given post HD.
   Max temp was 100. blood Cx sent x2.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with line sepsis, hypotension, and demand ischemia with EKG changes. She was treated with heparin for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding and was taken off heparin. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. She has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and has had multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's sepsis is not responding to antibiotics, and the source of infection remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of sepsis and to adjust treatment accordingly.
2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):** The patient's EKG changes and ischemic symptoms suggest the possibility of ACS. Further evaluation with cardiac enzymes and imaging studies is needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
3. **Gallbladder Cholecystitis:** Although the patient's bile cultures were negative, cholecystitis remains a possible cause of infection. Further imaging studies and laboratory tests are needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
4. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's elevated bilirubin and transaminases suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Further evaluation with liver function tests and imaging studies is needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
5. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's bleeding from the gallbladder drain and coffee ground residuals suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation with endoscopy and imaging studies is needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
6. **SVC Syndrome:** The patient's SVC syndrome is not responding to treatment, and further evaluation with imaging studies and medical therapy is needed to manage this condition.
7. **Renal Failure:** The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury from HD may require further management with dialysis and medication.
8. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or ARDS. Further evaluation with imaging studies and laboratory tests is needed to confirm or rule out these diagnoses.
9. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's ACS and ischemic symptoms suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation with cardiac enzymes and imaging studies is needed to confirm or rule out these diagnoses.

In summary, the patient's complex medical condition requires careful evaluation and management to address the multiple potential medical complications that are present. Further investigation and treatment are needed to determine the cause of sepsis, ACS, and other complications, and to manage the patient's chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension."

   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with line sepsis, hypotension, and demand ischemia with EKG changes. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Unclear source of infection: Despite treatment with meropenem, the patient has not grown any organisms from her bile cultures, making it unclear what the source of her infection is.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient was treated with heparin for Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding due to a prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of 150s. The PTT has since normalized to 26.7 after heparin was held.
3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has EKG changes consistent with ACS, which may be related to her underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a Respiratory System Impedance (RSI) of 430, which is likely falsely influenced by her high respiratory rate.
5. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient is experiencing a GI bleed, which may be related to her coagulopathy and elevated PTT.
6. Cholecystitis: The patient has a history of cholecystitis, but it is unclear if this is the source of her infection.
7. Renal failure: The patient is receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week, but her creatinine levels are elevated at 5.0 mg/dL.
8. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, but the source of her infection is unclear.

The patient's current plan is to continue to receive HD, with a goal of extubation today. She is also receiving treatment for her ACS, GI bleed, and coagulopathy. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible myocardial infarction. The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan, show gallbladder distension and dark red blood, coffee grounds, and small clots via ogt, which may be related to her GI bleed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal failure
3. GI bleed-related complications, such as hemorrhagic shock
4. Myocardial infarction or worsening ACS
5. Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
6. Coagulopathy-related bleeding complications
7. Infection-related complications, such as bacteremia or septic shock

The patient's ongoing care plan should include close monitoring of her laboratory results, imaging studies, and clinical status, as well as adjustments to her treatment plan as needed to address her complex medical conditions."

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who was admitted with line sepsis, hypotension, and demand ischemia. She developed EKG changes and abdominal pain with gallbladder distension noted on CT. Despite treatment for line sepsis, she continues to have intermittent fevers and has not grown organisms from her bile. She was treated with heparin for Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding and was switched to propofol for sedation.

The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, chronic renal failure, and acute coronary syndrome. She has undergone hemodialysis and has a dialysis catheter in place. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and lack of growth of organisms from her bile suggest that she may have a persistent source of infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but if they are positive, it could indicate bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and her PEEP is set at 5 cmH2O, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. She may require further respiratory support, such as increased PEEP or the use of a ventilator.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's EKG changes and abdominal pain could indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction, which could lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and coffee ground residuals from her nasogastric tube suggest that she may have gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
6. SVC Syndrome: The patient's PTT is elevated, and she has been treated with heparin for SVC syndrome. However, she may require further treatment with heparin or other anticoagulants to prevent thrombosis and bleeding.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease could worsen if she continues to experience hypovolemic shock or organ dysfunction, which could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and to provide appropriate treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 67 y/o female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal on
   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile
   .
   She was being treated with heparin for her SVC, with PTT in the 150s
   developed spontaneous bleeding everywhere
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.
   Vanc dose given post HD.
   Max temp was 100. blood Cx sent x2.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with line sepsis, hypotension, and demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain. She had a line sepsis that was treated, but the source of the infection remains unclear. She was started on heparin for Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding and was switched to a different anticoagulant. The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers despite coverage with meropenem, and no organisms have been grown in bile cultures. She has also developed dark red blood, coffee grounds, and clots in her bile drain, which may be related to her coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may not have been fully treated, and she may be at risk for further complications such as organ dysfunction or death.
2. Infection: The source of the patient's infection remains unclear, and she may be at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding complications, including spontaneous bleeding and bleeding from her bile drain, may be related to her coagulopathy and may require further management.
4. Kidney damage: The patient's chronic kidney disease may be worsening due to her sepsis and other complications, which could lead to further kidney damage or failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her sepsis and other complications, which could lead to further respiratory distress or failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may be at risk due to her sepsis and other complications, which could lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's altered nutrition and hypoglycemia may lead to further nutritional deficiencies and complications.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to her bleeding complications and may require further management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and infection status, and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Further evaluate the source of the patient's infection and consider additional diagnostic tests, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, to identify any potential sources of infection.
3. Manage the patient's bleeding complications, including spontaneous bleeding and bleeding from her bile drain, and consider further anticoagulation or hemostatic therapy.
4. Continue to manage the patient's chronic kidney disease and consider further nephrology consultation to optimize her kidney care.
5. Consider further respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation, to optimize the patient's respiratory status.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further cardiology consultation to optimize her cardiac care.
7. Consider further nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), to optimize the patient's nutritional status.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider further anticoagulation or hemostatic therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old female who is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to septic shock, acute coronary syndrome, and chronic renal failure. The patient has undergone several procedures, including a lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, which revealed a R-parietal lesion. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and anti-arrhythmics.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 131/50 mmHg (normal range: 65-135 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases are as follows:

* pH: 7.42
* Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2): 38 mmHg
* Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 330 mmHg
* Base excess (BE): -22 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 15.3 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.6 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count (PLT): 420 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine (Cr): 5.0 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 1.79 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.01 ng/mL)
* Calcium (Ca++): 10.7 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL)
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.2 mg/dL (normal range: 1.8-2.6 mg/dL)
* Phosphate (PO4): 4.5 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Altered mental status
* Respiratory failure
* Chronic renal failure
* Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
* Cholecystitis, calculous
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Hypotension
* Nutritional alteration
* Diabetes mellitus

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuation of antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy as needed
* Maintenance of mechanical ventilation with adjustments to tidal volume and PEEP as needed
* Continuation of chronic dialysis
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjustment of medications as needed
* Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and adjustment of anti-arrhythmic medications as needed
* Monitoring of nutritional status and adjustment of caloric intake as needed

Based on the patient's current condition and treatment plan, potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects
* Infection due to inadequate antibiotic therapy or colonization of medical devices
* Renal failure due to inadequate dialysis or electrolyte imbalances
* Nutritional deficiency due to inadequate caloric intake or malabsorption
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy or inadequate blood glucose monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, and chronic renal failure. She has a R parietal lesion on CT head and MRI scan, and a lumbar puncture was performed yesterday. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics for suspected bacteremia. Her vital signs are stable, but she is agitated and tachypneic when sedation is weaned. She has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis. She also has a history of coronary artery disease and has had ventricular arrhythmias in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and tachypnea could be indicative of sepsis, particularly given the presence of bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if sedation is continued or if she becomes more agitated and tachypneic.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or acidosis.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease could lead to further complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's R parietal lesion could lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cholecystitis could lead to further complications, such as pancreatitis or bowel obstruction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's sedation regimen to minimize respiratory depression and maximize comfort.
3. Continue antibiotics for suspected bacteremia and consider adding coverage for other potential pathogens.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels closely to prevent complications.
5. Consider consulting cardiology for further evaluation and management of the patient's coronary artery disease.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider adding antiemetics or antacids as needed.
7. Consider consulting neurology for further evaluation and management of the patient's R parietal lesion."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal presents with
   line sepsis, intubated for respiratory failure and has continuing
   hypotension
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): patient continues
   switching between AC and PSV.  As sedation is weaned, she becomes
   tachypneic and agitated, leading to more sedation, respiratory
   depression and worsened respiratory status.
   - Need to consult neuromuscular service regarding respiratory failure
   and possibility of neuro or muscular cause of weakness ***Neuromuscular
   fellow needs to be consulted - clinic number is [**5-/4548**], ask for
   neuromuscular fellow.***
   - CVVH to net negative
   - Sedation - propofol stopped due to elevated lipase, on fentanyl and
   versed - wean as tolerated
   - Trial of PS today
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, ABG to monitor changes q8h
   - Day 9 of intubation
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)- pt intermittantly requires pressors, and
   then reflexively becomes tachycardic. Required pressors last night for
   low maps after CVVH. [**Month (only) 60**] be septic picture due to lability and
   leukocytosis.
   - CVVH with pressure drop, restarted phenylephrine
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated today
   - F/u blood cultures - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - IR to replace HD
   - Remove HD line, culture tip
   - TTE
 BACTEREMIA MSSA: Abx d/c'd yesterday, and nafcillin started back
   yesterday.
   - Nafcillin - on day 11 of antibiotics (vanc or naf), plan for 21 day
   course per ID
   - f/u cultures
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**12-26**] sepsis vs ICP vs
   agitation.  LP performed. Currently sedated. Brain imaging not
   revealing. Sedated.
   - f/u LP results
   - lighten sedation as possible with anxiolytics
   - EEG
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): ESRD s/p failed renal txp, on dialysis.
   - CVVH last night, 1.6L off
   - f/u renal recs
   - Renal may need to replace line, consider line holiday, then line
   placed by IR
   Hyperglycemia: uncontrolled last few days. Added NPH to PM dose,
   monitor today. Consider altering sliding scale for better control.
   - Evaluate insulin sliding scale
   - Increased AM NPH to 7, PM to 5, evaluate today
   - q6h blood sugars
   Talk with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] and update PCP.
 [**Name10 (NameIs) 9991**], CALCULOUS.  Perc drained by surgery.  Surgery ready to
   sign off.
   - continue to monitor output.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   - tube feeds as tolerated, titrate to goal
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA).
   earlier in admission had ventricular arrhythmias on pressors, now
   resolved after 1d heparin drip and lidocaine drip.
   - Cont. to monitor for dysrrhythmias
   SVC syndrome - Not on systemic anticoagulation due to blood from
   gallbladder perc drain.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal presents with
   line sepsis, intubated for respiratory failure and has continuing
   hypotension
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): patient continues
   switching between AC and PSV.  As sedation is weaned, she becomes
   tachypneic and agitated, leading to more sedation, respiratory
   depression and worsened respiratory status.
   - Need to consult neuromuscular service regarding respiratory failure
   and possibility of neuro or muscular cause of weakness ***Neuromuscular
   fellow needs to be consulted - clinic number is [**5-/4548**], ask for
   neuromuscular fellow.***
   - CVVH to net negative
   - Sedation - propofol stopped due to elevated lipase, on fentanyl and
   versed - wean as tolerated
   - Trial of PS today
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, ABG to monitor changes q8h
   - Day 9 of intubation
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)- pt intermittantly requires pressors, and
   then reflexively becomes tachycardic. Required pressors last night for
   low maps after CVVH. [**Month (only) 60**] be septic picture due to lability and
   leukocytosis.
   - CVVH with pressure drop, restarted phenylephrine
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated today
   - F/u blood cultures - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Consider line holiday - culture tips
   - IR to replace HD line following 24h without lines
 BACTEREMIA MSSA: Abx d/c'd yesterday, and nafcillin started back
   yesterday.
   - Nafcillin - on day 11 of antibiotics (vanc or naf), plan for 21 day
   course per ID
   - f/u cultures
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**12-26**] sepsis vs ICP vs
   agitation.  LP performed. Currently sedated. Brain imaging not
   revealing. Sedated.
   - f/u LP results
   - lighten sedation as possible with anxiolytics
   - EEG
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): ESRD s/p failed renal txp, on dialysis.
   - CVVH last night, 1.6L off
   - f/u renal recs
   - Renal may need to replace line, consider line holiday, then line
   placed by IR
   Hyperglycemia: uncontrolled last few days. Added NPH to PM dose,
   monitor today. Consider altering sliding scale for better control.
   - Evaluate insulin sliding scale
   - Increased AM NPH to 7, PM to 5, evaluate today
   - q6h blood sugars
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS.  Perc drained by surgery.  Surgery ready to
   sign off.
   - continue to monitor output.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   - tube feeds as tolerated, titrate to goal
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA).
   earlier in admission had ventricular arrhythmias on pressors, now
   resolved after 1d heparin drip and lidocaine drip.
   - Cont. to monitor for dysrrhythmias
   SVC syndrome - Not on systemic anticoagulation due to blood from
   gallbladder perc drain.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal presents with
   line sepsis, intubated for respiratory failure and has continuing
   hypotension
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): patient continues
   switching between AC and PSV.  As sedation is weaned, she becomes
   tachypneic and agitated, leading to more sedation, respiratory
   depression and worsened respiratory status.
   - Need to consult neuromuscular service regarding respiratory failure
   and possibility of neuro or muscular cause of weakness ***Neuromuscular
   fellow needs to be consulted - clinic number is [**5-/4548**], ask for
   neuromuscular fellow.***
   - CVVH to net negative
   - Sedation - propofol stopped due to elevated lipase, on fentanyl and
   versed - wean as tolerated
   - Trial of PS today
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, ABG to monitor changes q8h
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)- pt intermittantly requires pressors, and
   then reflexively becomes tachycardic. Required pressors last night for
   low maps after CVVH. [**Month (only) 60**] be septic picture due to lability and
   leukocytosis.
   - CVVH with pressure drop, restarted phenylephrine
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated today
   - F/u blood cultures - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Consider line holiday - culture tips
 BACTEREMIA MSSA: Abx d/c'd yesterday, and nafcillin started back
   yesterday.
   - Nafcillin - on day 11 of antibiotics (vanc or naf), plan for 14 day
   course
   - f/u cultures
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**12-26**] sepsis vs ICP vs
   agitation.  LP performed. Currently sedated. Brain imaging not
   revealing. Sedated.
   - f/u LP results
   - lighten sedation as possible with anxiolytics
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): ESRD s/p failed renal txp, on dialysis.
   - CVVH last night, 1.5L off
   - f/u renal recs
   - Renal may need to replace line, consider line holiday, then line
   placed by IR
   Hyperglycemia: uncontrolled last few days. Added NPH to PM dose,
   monitor today. Consider altering sliding scale for better control.
   - Evaluate insulin sliding scale
   - Increase AM NPH to 10 if appropriate
   - q6h blood sugars
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS.  Perc drained by surgery.  Surgery ready to
   sign off.
   - continue to monitor output.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   - tube feeds as tolerated, titrate to goal
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA).
   earlier in admission had ventricular arrhythmias on pressors, now
   resolved after 1d heparin drip and lidocaine drip.
   - Cont. to monitor for dysrrhythmias
   SVC syndrome - Not on systemic anticoagulation due to blood from
   gallbladder perc drain.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who has failed cadaveric renal transplantation. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure and has continuing hypotension.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. She has been switching between assist-control (AC) and pressure-support ventilation (PSV) modes, and her respiratory status is worsening due to increased sedation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension, which is being managed with phenylephrine. Her blood pressure is labile, and she requires frequent adjustments to her pressor therapy.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, and she is receiving antibiotics.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which is possibly due to sepsis, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or agitation. She has undergone a lumbar puncture (LP) and is currently sedated.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis. She has undergone continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has a dialysis catheter in place.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and her insulin sliding scale has been adjusted.
7. Cholecystitis: The patient has calculous cholecystitis, which was treated with percutaneous drainage.
8. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient had earlier experienced ventricular arrhythmias on pressors, which have resolved after treatment with heparin and lidocaine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she may require more aggressive management, including tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and altered mental status may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, requiring more frequent dialysis or consideration of renal replacement therapy.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and cholecystitis may lead to further infections, including line-related infections and respiratory infections.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute coronary syndrome may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may lead to malnutrition and dehydration.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status. She also requires ongoing antibiotic therapy for her bacteremia and treatment of her cholecystitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis and hypotension. She has a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure. The patient's current condition is complicated by multiple medical issues, including altered mental status, cholecystitis, hyperglycemia, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis, bacteremia, and renal failure. She is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is complicated by bacteremia, which increases the risk of septic shock and organ failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as hemodialysis.
3. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's acute coronary syndrome is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as insulin therapy.
6. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as cholecystectomy.
7. Vascular Device Infection: The patient's vascular device infection is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as device removal and antibiotic therapy.
8. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome: The patient's superior vena cava syndrome is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as stenting and thrombolysis.
9. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as antimicrobial therapy and fluid replacement.
10. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and bacteremia, which may require further interventions such as vasopressor therapy and fluid replacement.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   High residuals on tube feeds, increasing the suspicion of abdominal
   pathology. Abdominal CT was performed, revealing abcesses in liver,
   kidney and spleen. She was empirically started on micafungin, mycolytic
   cultures, CMV antigen was sent out.
   She also developed a transaminitis to high 1000's
   In afternoon, febrile to 102.8, hypotensive with increasing lactate =

   immediately rebounded, became hypertensive to 180s, bp's remained
   labile for rest of afternoon, eventually weaned off neo. Last night bps
   tanked again, now on stress dose steroids, and has required neo and
   levo to maintain maps in the high 50s.
   Given fevers HD line removed, tip cultured. Hemodialysis tunnel line
   placement deferred as she became hemodynamically unstable with plan for

   HD tunnel deferred in setting of hemodynamic instability and temp, with
   plan for temporary line placement today and CVVH rather than HD if

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed
   cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF,
   hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is

   High residuals on tube feeds, increasing the suspicion of abdominal
   pathology. Abdominal CT was performed, revealing abcesses in liver,
   kidney and spleen. She was empirically started on micafungin, mycolytic
   cultures, CMV antigen was sent out.
   She also developed a transaminitis to high 1000's
   In afternoon, febrile to 102.8, hypotensive with increasing lactate =
   pancultured, got fluid ressucitation, started on neo. Almost
   immediately rebounded, became hypertensive to 180s, bp's remained
   labile for rest of afternoon, eventually weaned off neo. Last night bps
   tanked again, now on stress dose steroids, and has required neo and
   levo to maintain maps in the high 50s.
   Given fevers HD line removed, tip cultured. Hemodialysis tunnel line
   placement deferred as she became hemodynamically unstable with plan for
   temporary line placement today.
   HD tunnel deferred in setting of hemodynamic instability and temp, with
   plan for temporary line placement today and CVVH rather than HD if
   continues to require pressor support.
    Arterial line flattened, initially attempted rewiring, but clotted, so
   removed.
   Echo showed improvement of Left systolic function,also continues to
   have 2+ aortic [**Last Name (LF) 9995**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] explain why lower pressures, but this has
   been stable.

Based on the provided medical note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with failed cadaveric renal transplant, chronic dialysis, and multiple comorbidities.

The patient's current condition is severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, including altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, and hyperglycemia. She has a high white blood cell count, and cultures are pending to determine the source of the infection.

The patient's abdominal CT scan revealed multiple abscesses in the liver, kidney, and spleen, and she was empirically started on micafungin. She also has a transaminitis with elevated AST and ALT levels, which may be due to infection, ischemia, or thrombosis.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a requirement for pressor support and mechanical ventilation. She has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently on dialysis, but her kidney function is declining.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, with a recent increase in tube feeds, which may be contributing to her abdominal pathology. Her hyperglycemia is uncontrolled, and she has been prescribed NPH insulin.

The patient's cardiac status is also compromised, with a history of acute coronary syndrome and unstable angina. She has had ventricular arrhythmias in the past, which have resolved with treatment.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Sepsis management: Continue to treat with vancomycin, cefepime, and micafungin until cultures come back negative.
2. Respiratory support: Continue mechanical ventilation and pressor support.
3. Nutritional support: Hold tube feeds and titrate to goal.
4. Glycemic control: Continue NPH insulin sliding scale.
5. Renal support: Continue dialysis and consider temporary line placement by IR with plan for CVVH.
6. Cardiac support: Continue to monitor for dysrhythmias.
7. Abdominal support: Continue to monitor output from gallbladder perc drain.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Disseminated candidiasis from the multiple abscesses in the liver, kidney, and spleen.
2. Bacteremia and sepsis from the MSSA infection.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure from the chronic kidney disease and declining kidney function.
5. Hyperglycemic crisis from the uncontrolled diabetes.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias from the acute coronary syndrome and unstable angina.
7. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including ESRD, failed cadaveric renal transplant, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, line sepsis, and CAD, and has developed multiple medical complications, including:

* Abdominal abscesses and infarction
* Sepsis with cardiogenic and septic components
* Respiratory failure
* Hyperglycemia
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Renal failure
* Superior vena cava syndrome
* Vascular device infection
* Diarrhea
* Hypotension
* Dyspnea

The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin, and has been started on stress dose steroids. She has also been given fentanyl and midazolam for sedation and pain management.

Potential medical complications:

* Disseminated candidiasis
* Embolization from AS valve
* Shock liver
* Thrombotic complications
* Infection or abscess in the abdomen
* Respiratory failure
* Hyperglycemia
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Renal failure
* Superior vena cava syndrome
* Vascular device infection
* Diarrhea
* Hypotension
* Dyspnea

Plan:

* Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and stress dose steroids
* Monitor for signs of disseminated candidiasis and embolization from AS valve
* Consider performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to visualize the valve
* Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal status and consider performing an abdominal US with Doppler to examine flow venous
* Consider holding tube feeds and monitoring the patient's nutritional status
* Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust the insulin sliding scale as needed
* Consider performing a liver biopsy to evaluate the cause of the transaminitis
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider performing an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function
* Consider performing a CT scan of the abdomen to evaluate the patient's abdominal status."

   High residuals on tube feeds, increasing the suspicion of abdominal
   pathology. Abdominal CT was performed, revealing abcesses in liver,
   kidney and spleen. She was empirically started on micafungin, mycolytic
   cultures, CMV antigen was sent out.
   She also developed a transaminitis to high 1000's
   In afternoon, febrile to 102.8, hypotensive with increasing lactate =
   pancultured, got fluid ressucitation, started on neo. Almost
   immediately rebounded, became hypertensive to 180s, bp's remained
   labile for rest of afternoon, eventually weaned off neo. Last night bps
   tanked again, now on stress dose steroids, and has required neo and
   levo to maintain maps in the high 50s.
   Given fevers HD line removed, tip cultured. Hemodialysis tunnel line
   placement deferred as she became hemodynamically unstable with plan for
   temporary line placement today.
   HD tunnel deferred in setting of hemodynamic instability and temp, with
   plan for temporary line placement today and CVVH rather than HD if
   continues to require pressor support.
    Arterial line flattened, initially attempted rewiring, but clotted, so
   removed.
   Echo showed improvement of Left systolic function,also continues to
   have 2+ aortic [**Last Name (LF) 9995**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] explain why lower pressures, but this has

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed
   cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF,
   hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is
   transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the
   setting of HD.

   High residuals on tube feeds, increasing the suspicion of abdominal
   pathology. Abdominal CT was performed, revealing abcesses in liver,
   kidney and spleen. She was empirically started on micafungin, mycolytic
   cultures, CMV antigen was sent out.
   She also developed a transaminitis to high 1000's
   In afternoon, febrile to 102.8, hypotensive with increasing lactate =
   pancultured, got fluid ressucitation, started on neo. Almost
   immediately rebounded, became hypertensive to 180s, bp's remained
   labile for rest of afternoon, eventually weaned off neo. Last night bps
   tanked again, now on stress dose steroids, and has required neo and
   levo to maintain maps in the high 50s.
   Given fevers HD line removed, tip cultured. Hemodialysis tunnel line
   placement deferred as she became hemodynamically unstable with plan for
   temporary line placement today.
   HD tunnel deferred in setting of hemodynamic instability and temp, with
   plan for temporary line placement today and CVVH rather than HD if
   continues to require pressor support.
    Arterial line flattened, initially attempted rewiring, but clotted, so
   removed.
   Echo showed improvement of Left systolic function,also continues to
   have 2+ aortic [**Last Name (LF) 9995**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] explain why lower pressures, but this has
   been stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic dialysis. She has recently developed line sepsis, which led to her admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension and labile blood pressure requiring vasopressors.
3. Fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
4. Abdominal pain and tenderness, with suspected cholecystitis and possibly perforation.
5. Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
6. Hyperglycemia and altered mental status.
7. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with unstable angina and coronary ischemia.
8. Bacteremia and suspected vascular device infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Septic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis.
4. Liver failure and coagulopathy.
5. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
8. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Vasopressors to manage hypotension.
3. Mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
4. Insulin therapy for hyperglycemia.
5. Nephrology consultation for management of AKI and CKD.
6. Cardiology consultation for management of ACS and coronary ischemia.
7. Gastroenterology consultation for management of cholecystitis and suspected perforation.
8. Infection control measures to prevent further sepsis and VTE.

A family meeting is planned for 2:30 pm today to discuss the patient's condition and treatment plan with the family."
