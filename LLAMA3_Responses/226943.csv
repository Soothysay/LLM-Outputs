   ProBNP: [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]
   Microbiology:
   Blood Cultures ([**6-20**]): Pending
   Studies:
   CT Head [**6-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
   ECHO [**6-20**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most
   consistent with pulmonary edema. There are accompanying small
   effusions. 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position 6 cm above the
   carina.
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Start milrinone/neo/lasix as above
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol

   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

**Cardiovascular:**

* The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease.
* He was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest, with multiple episodes of loss of pulse and wide complex tachycardia.
* His initial ECG showed global WCT in limb leads, which has resolved.
* He has a BiV/ICD in place and was on coumadin and digoxin at baseline.
* His current rhythm is atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.
* He has a severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF=15%) and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

**Respiratory:**

* The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 70%.
* His ABG is improving, with a pH of 7.32/41/104.
* He has a history of no known pulmonary disease, but may be experiencing fluid overload from decompensated heart failure.

**Renal:**

* The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.
* He has a history of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest, which may have contributed to his renal failure.
* He is currently receiving IV lasix and dopamine for diuresis and inotropes.

**Metabolic:**

* The patient has metabolic acidosis, with an initial ABG of 7.16/32/189.
* His lactate level is 5.6 mmol/L, and his Cr is increasing.
* He is receiving IV fluids and diuresis to manage his acidosis.

**Neurological:**

* The patient has increased tone in his bilateral upper and lower extremities, with no patellar, tricep, or bicep reflexes.
* He has bilateral upgoing toes.
* He is receiving continuous EEG monitoring.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for further arrhythmias due to his atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and possible digoxin toxicity.
* Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk for further cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and possible electrolyte imbalances.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and possible fluid overload.
* Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for further renal failure due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and possible electrolyte imbalances.
* Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is at risk for further metabolic acidosis due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and possible electrolyte imbalances.

**Plan:**

* Continue cooling protocol and pressor support.
* Start milrinone and neosynephrine as inotropes.
* Add Lasix for diuresis.
* Monitor potassium levels and maintain >5.0.
* Hold carvedilol and digoxin for now.
* Continue ECG monitoring and telemetry.
* Order a formal EP consult and follow-up on their recommendations.
* Continue IV steroid clinical trial per protocol.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Studies:
   CT Head [**6-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
   ECHO [**6-20**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most
   consistent with pulmonary edema. There are accompanying small
   effusions. 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position 6 cm above the
   carina.
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Start milrinone/neo/lasix as above
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male who was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest. He has a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve repair. He was intubated and started on pressor support, dopamine, and midazolam. His ECG showed resolution of global WCT in limb leads. He has a history of cardiac arrest, and his ICD fired multiple times, leading to wide complex tachycardia and possible polymorphic VT.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Acute on chronic renal failure: His creatinine increased from 1.2-1.6 to 1.9, likely due to poor forward flow during cardiac arrest.
2. Decompensated systolic CHF: He has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10-15%. His BNP is elevated, and he has signs of fluid overload, including elevated JVP, effusion on CXR, and LE edema.
3. Metabolic acidosis: His initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, with primary AG metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis and acute renal failure.
4. Respiratory failure: He is intubated and requires pressor support, with ABGs showing improvement after intubation.
5. Rhythm/wide complex tachycardia: He has a history of atrial fibrillation and has had multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardia, including polymorphic VT, which required shocks and ACLS/CPR.

The patient is currently on the following medications:

* Dopamine
* Midazolam
* Fentanyl
* Versed
* Lasix
* Milrinone
* Neosynephrine
* Digoxin
* Coumadin

The plan is to:

* Continue cooling protocol and pressor support
* Start milrinone and neosynephrine to support blood pressure and cardiac output
* Add Lasix to diurese
* Monitor electrolytes and adjust medications accordingly
* Follow ABGs and adjust ventilator settings as needed
* Replete lytes and hold on fluids given patient appears volume overloaded
* Follow Cr and adjust medications accordingly
* Monitor UOP and send Ulytes and LFT
* Keep femoral line for now and change to different access when INR decreases
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT and VAP
* Monitor glycemic control and nutrition
* Update family and healthcare proxy regularly

The patient's code status is FULL CODE, and his disposition is CCU for now."

   CT Head [**6-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
   ECHO [**6-20**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most
   consistent with pulmonary edema. There are accompanying small
   effusions. 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position 6 cm above the
   carina.
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.
   - Cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult in AM
   - bedside ECHO overnight showed same as prior (mod to severe MR, global
   HK, EF 15%, mod TR, pleural effusion, no pericardial effusion), f/u
   final read
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags (next 6am) and
   closely follow K
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - Wean Dopamine as tolerated MAP>55
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>4), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - f/u final ECHO report
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease. He was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest, requiring multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. He was intubated and started on a cooling protocol to manage his cardiac arrest. He has been experiencing poor urine output, and his creatinine level has increased to 1.9 from a baseline of 1.2-1.6.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T= 94.6, BP= 82/63-108/76 mmHg, HR= 63-91 bpm, RR= 8-38 insp/min, SpO2= 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min, Levophed and neosynephrine weaned off
* Respiratory support: Intubated and on a ventilator with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 70%
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with a severely depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF= 15%)
* Neurological: Increased tone in bilateral upper and lower extremities, unable to illicit patellar, tricep, or bicep reflexes
* Laboratory results:
	+ Blood cultures: Pending
	+ ECG: Showing irregular wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible positive concordance
	+ Troponin-T: 0.10
	+ Lactic acid: 5.6 mmol/L
	+ Creatinine: 1.9
	+ BNP: [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the recent wide complex tachycardia episode increase his risk of further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's increased creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and ventilator support may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory failure, and he may require further respiratory support.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and his current laboratory results, including lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury, increase his risk of developing sepsis.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, including primary AG metabolic acidosis, and he may require further management to correct this.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's increased tone and decreased reflexes suggest possible neurological complications, including stroke or encephalopathy.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CXR shows marked cardiomegaly and patchy perihilar opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema.

Plan:

1. Continue cooling protocol to manage cardiac arrest.
2. Monitor patient's urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Replete electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium.
4. Follow up on laboratory results, including blood cultures and ECG.
5. Consider further cardiac interventions, such as an EP consult and possible cardioversion.
6. Manage respiratory failure with continued ventilator support and possible extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis and treat accordingly.
8. Manage metabolic acidosis with further adjustments to ventilator settings and electrolyte repletion.
9. Consider further neurological evaluations, including a neurology consult and possible imaging studies."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy. Stopped milrinone
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy. Stopped milrinone
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.

   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on

          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest, requiring multiple rounds of ACLS/CPR and ICD firing. He is currently intubated and on pressor support. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and decompensated systolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and he has not produced any urine output. He is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) and potentially progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, including primary AG metabolic acidosis, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and respiratory acidosis. He is at risk of developing further acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been experiencing wide complex tachycardia, which may be related to electrolyte imbalances, digoxin toxicity, or other factors. He is at risk of developing further arrhythmias, including polymorphic VT/VF.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and is at risk of developing infection, particularly urinary tract infections (UTIs) given his lack of urine output.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of response to antibiotics suggest the possibility of sepsis.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on pressor support, which increases his risk of developing respiratory failure and potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has experienced myoclonus and decreased cortical activity, which may be related to sedation or other factors. He is at risk of developing further neurological complications, including seizures or stroke.
8. Bleeding: The patient's INR is elevated, and he is at risk of bleeding, particularly given his history of cardiac arrest and ICD firing.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and urine output to assess for AKI and potential progression to ESRD.
2. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address this complication.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address any arrhythmias.
4. Monitor the patient's temperature and blood cultures to assess for infection.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address any neurological complications.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address any respiratory complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address any bleeding complications."

   the upper stomach, no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Pleural
   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary
   power pack. Two remnant left-sided leads end in the right atrium and
   right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid
   input and not able to diurese; and consider bolusing prn
   - Cr: 5am 2.3, 10am 2.5, 2pm 2.7, 6pm 2.9, 10pm 3.0 , this AM 3.5 (not
   urinating at all)
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and cardiac arrest. He was found unresponsive and intubated, with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. He has been treated with milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix, and is currently receiving pressor support. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, decreased potassium levels, and an increased creatinine level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and his current condition is at risk of further cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiomyopathy and the use of pressor support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has not produced any urine output, indicating acute renal failure. This may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, including primary AG metabolic acidosis, which may lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability.
4. Myoclonus: The patient has developed myoclonus, which may be a sign of cortical activity and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate a stress response or infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and pressor support may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued pressor support and close monitoring of his cardiovascular and renal function. He should be monitored for signs of cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's myoclonus should be further evaluated and treated as necessary. The patient's infection risk should be assessed, and antibiotics should be started if necessary. The patient's coagulopathy should be monitored and treated with vitamin K. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the ventilator settings should be adjusted as necessary. The patient's gastrointestinal status should be monitored for signs of bleeding."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.  Weaned
   sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having facial
   twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount of
   versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing

   the upper stomach, no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Pleural
   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary

   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.  Weaned
   sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having facial
   twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount of
   versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   - K: 5am 4.2, 10am 4.5 (gave 20mEq po crushed via NGT), 2pm 4.3, 6pm
   4.1 (gave 20mEq), 10pm 4.3

   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and on a cooling protocol, pressor support, and inotropes. His condition is complex, with multiple potential etiologies for his arrhythmia, including electrolyte abnormalities, digoxin toxicity, and possible cocaine use. He has a history of decompensated heart failure, and his current condition is likely multifactorial, with cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure contributing to his overall instability.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued arrhythmia: The patient's wide complex tachycardia is concerning for polymorphic VT, and his recent episodes of unresponsiveness may have been related to this arrhythmia. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further episodes.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of decompensated heart failure and his current condition, with elevated JVP and effusion on CXR, suggest that he may be at risk for further cardiac decompensation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and decreased urine output suggest that he may be at risk for further renal deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and pressor support suggest that he may be at risk for further respiratory failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, and his lactate level was elevated. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further metabolic acidosis.
6. Infection: The patient's femoral line and possible fluid overload increase his risk of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and possible coagulopathy increase his risk of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's arrhythmia and adjust management as necessary.
2. Continue inotropes and pressor support as necessary to maintain cardiac output.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust management as necessary to prevent further cardiac decompensation.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust management as necessary to prevent further renal deterioration.
5. Continue respiratory support and adjust management as necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and adjust management as necessary to prevent further acidosis.
7. Consider removing the femoral line when the patient's INR decreases to reduce the risk of infection.
8. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent infection.
9. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to the patient's regimen to prevent bleeding.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust management as necessary to prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%

   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)

   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
   .
   No urination: 20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped and consider
   bolusing
   .
   - K: 5am 4.2, 10am 4.5 (gave 20mEq po crushed via NGT), 2pm 4.3, 6pm

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and on pressor support due to hypotension and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been experiencing irregular wide complex tachycardia, which may be related to polymorphic VT or digoxin toxicity. He also has decompensated systolic CHF with an EF of 10-15%, and is receiving inotropic support with milrinone and neosynephrine. The patient has not been producing urine, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute renal failure.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Arrest:** The patient is at risk for further cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and digoxin toxicity.
2. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN):** The patient's lack of urine production and elevated creatinine levels suggest ATN, which may lead to chronic kidney disease if not addressed.
3. **Acute Respiratory Failure:** The patient is intubated and on pressor support, which increases the risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's initial ABG showed a triple acid-base disorder, which may lead to further metabolic acidosis if not managed.
5. **Infection:** The patient's leucocytosis and lack of antibiotic coverage increase the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of an indwelling femoral line.
6. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's supratherapeutic INR and increased risk of bleeding due to his cardiac condition and anticoagulation therapy.
7. **Renal Failure:** The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
8. **Seizures:** The patient's myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on sedation may increase the risk of seizures if sedation is stopped.
9. **Pain Management:** The patient's pain management with fentanyl and versed may need to be adjusted to avoid respiratory depression and other complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels closely to prevent cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
2. Continue inotropic support with milrinone and neosynephrine to improve cardiac output and urine production.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Replete electrolytes and monitor lactate levels to prevent metabolic acidosis.
5. Consider antibiotic coverage for the patient's leucocytosis and potential infection.
6. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed to prevent bleeding.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist for further management of the patient's acute renal failure.
8. Monitor the patient's pain management and adjust as needed to avoid respiratory depression and other complications.
9. Consider weaning sedation to assess the patient's cortical activity and potential for seizures."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid
   input and not able to diurese; and consider bolusing prn

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support

   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.

   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on

   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease. He was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest, with multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. He was intubated and placed on a cooling protocol and pressor support. The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of 9-19% and is currently in decompensated heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Electrolytes: Hypokalemia (K 2.3-3.5 mmol/L)
* Lactate: 2.8 mmol/L
* Creatinine: 1.9-3.5 mg/dL
* BNP: 7772
* Troponin-T: 0.29 ng/mL
* ECG: Irregular wide complex tachycardia with possible polymorphic VT
* ABG: Respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and non-gap metabolic acidosis

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Decompensated systolic heart failure
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Metabolic acidosis
* Myoclonus
* Leucocytosis
* Coagulation disorder (INR 6.5)
* Acute respiratory failure

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of hypokalemia and digoxin toxicity increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Myoclonus: The patient's myoclonus may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Coagulation disorder: The patient's coagulation disorder may worsen if not properly managed.
7. Infection: The patient's leucocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out and treated promptly.
8. Thromboembolic events: The patient's supratherapeutic INR increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue milrinone and neosynephrine to support cardiac output and blood pressure.
2. Wean sedation as tolerated and monitor for signs of increased cortical activity.
3. Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy.
4. Monitor electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, and replete as necessary.
5. Monitor lactate and renal function, and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
6. Consider renal consult for possible HD.
7. Continue to monitor and adjust the patient's medications, including anticoagulation therapy.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and consider antibiotics if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary.
10. Consider cardiac arrest team and neurology consult for further evaluation and management."

   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid

    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   EEG and todays CXR pending
   [**2120-6-21**]: CXR: ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in
   the upper stomach, no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Pleural
   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary
   power pack. Two remnant left-sided leads end in the right atrium and
   right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, has been cooled and rewarmed.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity.  Currently on
   only neosynephrine, have weaned sedation and milrinone, and stopped
   lasix.
   - try to restart milrinone to see if it increases inotropy (will
   restart without bolus because milrinone renally cleared)
   - if increased ectopy, can start him on amiodarone through the NGT
   (although a balance because likely shock liver and amiodarone may not
   be well tolerated)
   - keep in touch with neuro regarding brain activity
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - continue to use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting
   of milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - continuous EEG monitor
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline.   Now with significant ectopy overnight.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Beta blocker for rhythm control
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, can give vitamin K
   - hold carvedilol and digoxin
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue neosynephrine, retry milrinone as above
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Will give FFP and put in central IJ line for access, as femoral line
   has large risk of infection
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid
   input and not able to diurese; and consider bolusing prn
   - Cr: 5am 2.3, 10am 2.5, 2pm 2.7, 6pm 2.9, 10pm 3.0 , this AM 3.5 (not
   urinating at all)
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
   .
   - K: 5am 4.2, 10am 4.5 (gave 20mEq po crushed via NGT), 2pm 4.3, 6pm

   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, has been cooled and rewarmed.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity.  Currently on
   only neosynephrine, have weaned sedation and milrinone, and stopped
   lasix.
   - try to restart milrinone to see if it increases inotropy (will
   restart without bolus because milrinone renally cleared)
   - if increased ectopy, can start him on amiodarone through the NGT
   (although a balance because likely shock liver and amiodarone may not
   be well tolerated)
   - keep in touch with neuro regarding brain activity
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - continue to use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting
   of milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - continuous EEG monitor
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline.   Now with significant ectopy overnight.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Beta blocker for rhythm control
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, can give vitamin K
   - hold carvedilol and digoxin
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue neosynephrine, retry milrinone as above
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Will give FFP and put in central IJ line for access, as femoral line
   has large risk of infection
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease, who was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest. He was intubated and resuscitated, and is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Decompensated systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10-15%.
2. Acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL and no urine output.
3. Metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 2.8 mmol/L.
4. Respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Wide complex tachycardia with possible polymorphic VT.
6. Myoclonus with decreased cortical activity.
7. Leucocytosis with a WBC count of 12.2 K/uL.
8. Coagulopathy with an INR of 6.5 and a platelet count of 122 K/uL.

The patient is currently receiving:

1. Neosynephrine to support blood pressure.
2. Milrinone to increase inotropy.
3. Metoprolol to aid with ectopy.
4. Fentanyl and versed for pain management.
5. Lasix for fluid overload.
6. Vitamin K to correct coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and digoxin toxicity.
2. Respiratory failure due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury due to inadequate perfusion and fluid overload.
4. Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis and acute renal failure.
5. Coagulopathy due to warfarin therapy and liver dysfunction.
6. Infection due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression.
7. Seizures due to electrolyte imbalances and cortical activity.
8. Cardiovascular instability due to inadequate perfusion and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is being considered for transfer to the CCU for further management."

   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid

    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   EEG and todays CXR pending
   [**2120-6-21**]: CXR: ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in
   the upper stomach, no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Pleural
   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary
   power pack. Two remnant left-sided leads end in the right atrium and
   right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid
   input and not able to diurese; and consider bolusing prn
   - Cr: 5am 2.3, 10am 2.5, 2pm 2.7, 6pm 2.9, 10pm 3.0 , this AM 3.5 (not
   urinating at all)
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Inotropes (milrinone and neosynephrine) to support blood pressure and cardiac output
* Diuretics (furosemide) to manage fluid overload
* Beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias
* Sedation to manage agitation and anxiety
* Antibiotics to prevent infection
* Vitamin K to correct coagulopathy
* Pain management with fentanyl and versed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Worsening of kidney function
* Development of sepsis or organ failure
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to hypotension and fluid overload
* Potential for further neurological deterioration

Based on the patient's current condition and treatment plan, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition to prevent further complications and optimize his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple complex medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not explicitly stated, but the note highlights several significant events and concerns.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and required changes in milrinone dosing. Amiodarone was also administered, but the patient's arrhythmia persisted.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's fibrinogen levels are elevated, and INR is 6.5, indicating a high likelihood of DIC. The patient received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an IJ procedure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient is on dialysis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
5. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the patient has received antibiotics.
6. Nutritional concerns: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition, but the exact composition and dosing are not specified.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is described as altered, but the specific nature of the alteration is not specified.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening cardiac arrhythmias
2. Progression of DIC, potentially leading to bleeding or thrombotic complications
3. Further deterioration of renal function
4. Respiratory failure, potentially requiring escalation of mechanical ventilation or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
5. Sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction
6. Nutritional deficiencies or complications
7. Delirium or other neurological complications related to altered mental status

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management of these potential complications will be essential to ensure optimal care and improve the patient's outcome."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Milrinone restarted w/o bolus at .375mcg/kg/min (mistakingly given at
   0.25 mcg/kg/min until [**2110**] [**6-22**]) changed to 0.375 and patient with
   increased NSVT about every other beat; Started amio 400 po TID, but
   NSVT did not decrease; so switched back down to 0.25 and ectopy
   decreased in frequency
   - Neo 3 until midnight, then continued on 4;
   FDP High 40-80; fibrinogen: 284 INR: 6.5; likely DIC---> given 4 units
   FFP for IJ procedure, which will help...Will check DIC labs again at
   [**2110**] [**6-22**].
   - LFT's trending down...unlikely shock liver. Continue to monitor with
   AM labs
   - Right IJ placed [**2120-6-22**]; Femoral pulled [**2120-6-22**] on 4 units FFP; CXR

   be done, will contact attending and get back with us. Continue to hold
   sedation as that is what neuro will want; try not to give anything for
   myoclonus if can help it, as treatment may do more harm than good (Tx

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST/ Cardiogenic Shock: Unclear precipitant, but
   etiologies of arrhythmia include electrolyte abnomalities such as
   hypokalemia, BiV/ICD anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide
   complex tachycardia for sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in
   setting of dig toxicity. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight  on
   day of admission ICD interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of
   ineffective ATP leading to shock with one episode at 11am, and one at
   4:46pm which may correlate with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness.
   Initial lytes showed hypokalemia, acidemia. No evidence of ACS as
   etiology.  Patient stable hemodynamically on milrinone and neo. Will
   attempt to wean
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - Metoprolol and Amiodorone to prevent increased NSVT
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - Q12hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain
   >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  Give milrinone to smallest effective dose;
   -  Continue amiodorone po, and consider amio gtt if milrinone is to be
   increased
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   - Hold lasix for now as patient is not making much urine
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10;
   22/12.2/0.35; 22/12.2/0.29;
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize,
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Triple acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic
   acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic acidosis and acute renal failure, with
   concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Milrinone restarted w/o bolus at .375mcg/kg/min (mistakingly given at
   0.25 mcg/kg/min until [**2110**] [**6-22**]) changed to 0.375 and patient with
   increased NSVT about every other beat; Started amio 400 po TID, but
   NSVT did not decrease; so switched back down to 0.25 and ectopy
   decreased in frequency
   - Neo 3 until midnight, then continued on 4;
   FDP High 40-80; fibrinogen: 284 INR: 6.5; likely DIC---> given 4 units
   FFP for IJ procedure, which will help...Will check DIC labs again at
   [**2110**] [**6-22**].
   - LFT's trending down...unlikely shock liver. Continue to monitor with
   AM labs
   - Right IJ placed [**2120-6-22**]; Femoral pulled [**2120-6-22**] on 4 units FFP; CXR

   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] Neuro: Resident isn't sure about further studies that can
   be done, will contact attending and get back with us. Continue to hold
   sedation as that is what neuro will want; try not to give anything for
   myoclonus if can help it, as treatment may do more harm than good (Tx

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST/ Cardiogenic Shock: Unclear precipitant, but
   etiologies of arrhythmia include electrolyte abnomalities such as
   hypokalemia, BiV/ICD anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide
   complex tachycardia for sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in
   setting of dig toxicity. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight  on
   day of admission ICD interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of
   ineffective ATP leading to shock with one episode at 11am, and one at
   4:46pm which may correlate with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness.
   Initial lytes showed hypokalemia, acidemia. No evidence of ACS as
   etiology.  Patient stable hemodynamically on milrinone and neo. Will
   attempt to wean
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - Metoprolol and Amiodorone to prevent increased NSVT
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - Q12hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain
   >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  Give milrinone to smallest effective dose;
   -  Continue amiodorone po, and consider amio gtt if milrinone is to be
   increased
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   - Hold lasix for now as patient is not making much urine
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10;
   22/12.2/0.35; 22/12.2/0.29;
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize,
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Triple acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic
   acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic acidosis and acute renal failure, with
   concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 2.6 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF ->  ATN; Patient with less than 200 cc in past
   24 hours;
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation  stopped for past 24 hours;

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and CRI who was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest. He was intubated and received multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. The patient has been stabilized hemodynamically on milrinone and neo, but continues to experience arrhythmias, including wide complex tachycardia and polymorphic VT.

The patient has a number of underlying conditions, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a combination of factors, including arrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and possible digoxin toxicity.
2. Decompensated systolic CHF: The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy and has decompensated heart failure with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR, and LE edema.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's Cr has increased to 2.6 from a baseline of 1.2-1.6, likely due to poor forward flow during cardiac arrest.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a triple acid-base disorder with primary AG metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure.
5. DIC: The patient has an INR of 6.5 and a DIC panel suggestive of DIC, for which he received 4 units of FFP during IJ placement.
6. Myoclonus: The patient has myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on sedation.
7. Leucocytosis: The patient has a decreased WBC count from 12.2 to 11.0, likely due to stress response.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's arrhythmias may continue to pose a risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to continued fluid overload and possible pneumonia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may continue to worsen if not managed properly.
5. DIC: The patient's DIC may continue to pose a risk of bleeding and thrombosis if not managed properly.
6. Myoclonus: The patient's myoclonus may continue to pose a risk of injury and discomfort if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient's leucocytosis may be a sign of infection, which could worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue milrinone and neo to support cardiac function.
2. Monitor and adjust vent settings to improve oxygenation.
3. Continue to manage metabolic acidosis with aggressive repletion of lytes and fluids.
4. Monitor and adjust renal function with close follow-up of Cr and UOP.
5. Continue to manage DIC with FFP and vitamin K.
6. Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate myoclonus.
7. Follow up with neuro and cardiology teams to optimize management of myoclonus and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Consider renal consult for possible HD.
9. Continue to monitor and adjust glycemic control with fingersticks.
10. Monitor and adjust pain management with fentanyl and versed."

   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST/ Cardiogenic Shock: Patient stable hemodynamically
   on milrinone and neo.
   - Continue Milrinone gtt at 0.25 mcg/kg/min  to act as inotrope MAP>55,
   HR tolerated to 120.
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - Metoprolol to prevent increased NSVT
   - DC Amiodarone
   - Q24hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain
   >5.0)
   - Cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Vpaced, with ectopy. Currently,
   tachycardic at 110
 120
   -  If Tachycardic increased >120, IV lopressor.
   -  Give milrinone to smallest effective dose;
   -  DC amiodarone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Beta blocker
   - follow lytes Q24hours, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%.
   - Continue milrinone/neo as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   - Hold lasix for now as patient is not making much urine
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10;
   22/12.2/0.35; 22/12.2/0.29;
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize,
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: ABG improving as well as lactate.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 2.6 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF ->  ATN; Patient with less than 200 cc in past
   24 hours;
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation  stopped for past 24 hours;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   -      Neuro will re-assess further interventions
   #Leucocytosis-decreased from  WBC: 12.2 to 11.0 ; likely stress
   response but cannot rule out infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # DIC: INR 6.5 and DIC panel suggestive of DIC. Patient given 4 units
   of FFP during IJ placement which helped his DIC.
          -        Continue to get [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs and give FFP as needed
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   ..
   # Shock Liver: with increased AST/ALT during admission concern for
   shock liver. Labs show decreasing numbers and unlikely shock liver at
   this time
   -   daily AST/ALT to monitor
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   sedation is out of system
   -      Neuro will re-assess further interventions
   #Leucocytosis-decreased from  WBC: 12.2 to 11.0 ; likely stress
   response but cannot rule out infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # DIC: INR 6.5 and DIC panel suggestive of DIC. Patient given 4 units
   of FFP during IJ placement which helped his DIC.
          -        Continue to get [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs and give FFP as needed
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.

   Code status: FULL CODE confirmed with family, ICU consent signed,
   Discuss goals of care.
   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving pressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiomyopathy, there is a high risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is receiving pressor support to maintain blood pressure. This increases the risk of shock, particularly if the pressors are weaned or discontinued.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if the patient develops respiratory muscle weakness.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and there is a risk of developing metabolic acidosis if the acidosis is not addressed.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of developing AKI if the patient's renal function is not monitored and managed appropriately.
6. DIC: The patient has a high INR and is at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. Myoclonus: The patient is experiencing myoclonus, which can be a sign of underlying neurologic damage or seizures.
8. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is a risk of developing an infection, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised.
9. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and there is a risk of developing liver dysfunction or failure if the patient's liver function is not monitored and managed appropriately.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Continued pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
2. Monitoring of cardiac function and optimization of cardiac medications.
3. Intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, metabolic, and renal function.
4. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and DIC.
5. Pain management and sedation to manage the patient's discomfort and agitation.
6. Nutritional support, including tube feeds, to ensure adequate nutrition and caloric intake.
7. Regular monitoring of the patient's laboratory values, including liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation studies.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address his complex medical needs and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Milrinone restarted w/o bolus at .375mcg/kg/min (mistakingly given at
   0.25 mcg/kg/min until [**2110**] [**6-22**]) changed to 0.375 and patient with
   increased NSVT about every other beat; Started amio 400 po TID, but
   NSVT did not decrease; so switched back down to 0.25 and ectopy
   decreased in frequency
   - Neo 3 until midnight, then continued on 4;
   FDP High 40-80; fibrinogen: 284 INR: 6.5; likely DIC---> given 4 units
   FFP for IJ procedure, which will help...Will check DIC labs again at
   [**2110**] [**6-22**].
   - LFT's trending down...unlikely shock liver. Continue to monitor with
   AM labs
   - Right IJ placed [**2120-6-22**]; Femoral pulled [**2120-6-22**] on 4 units FFP; CXR
   OK to use, no pneumo and in distal SVC.
   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] Neuro: Resident isn't sure about further studies that can
   be done, will contact attending and get back with us. Continue to hold
   sedation as that is what neuro will want; try not to give anything for
   myoclonus if can help it, as treatment may do more harm than good (Tx
   is likely low dose benzos)

   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%.
   - Continue milrinone/neo as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   - Hold lasix for now as patient is not making much urine
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10;
   22/12.2/0.35; 22/12.2/0.29;
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize,
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: ABG improving as well as lactate.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 2.6 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF ->  ATN; Patient with less than 200 cc in past
   24 hours;
   - Minimize fluid intake
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation  stopped for past 24 hours;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   -      Neuro will re-assess further interventions
   #Leucocytosis-decreased from  WBC: 12.2 to 11.0 ; likely stress
   response but cannot rule out infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # DIC: INR 6.5 and DIC panel suggestive of DIC. Patient given 4 units
   of FFP during IJ placement which helped his DIC.
          -        Continue to get [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs and give FFP as needed
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   ..
   # Shock Liver: with increased AST/ALT during admission concern for
   shock liver. Labs show decreasing numbers and unlikely shock liver at
   this time
   -   daily AST/ALT to monitor
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and cardiac arrest from unknown etiology. The patient is currently intubated and on pressor support, with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic instability, with a MAP of 55 and HR of 112
* Irregular heart rhythm with NSVT
* Decreased cardiac output, with a EF of 9-15%
* Respiratory failure, with intubation and ventilation
* Metabolic acidosis, with an ABG of 7.37/32/158/17 and lactate of 3.1
* Acute on chronic renal failure, with a Cr of 2.6 and less than 200cc of urine output in the past 24 hours
* Leucocytosis, with a WBC of 12.2
* DIC, with an INR of 6.5 and DIC panel suggestive of DIC
* Shock liver, with increased AST/ALT during admission, but currently unlikely

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing milrinone and neo to support blood pressure and cardiac output
* Weaning off sedation as tolerated
* Monitoring of electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium, and repletion as necessary
* Following INR and holding coumadin as supratherapeutic
* Holding carvedilol and digoxin for now
* Monitoring of renal function and considering renal consult for possible HD
* Restarting sedation if patient cannot tolerate
* Continuing to get DIC labs and giving FFP as needed
* Monitoring and giving vitamin K for the next three days
* Continuing to monitor and treat myoclonus
* Following ABGs and VBGs to monitor metabolic acidosis
* Repleting lytes and holding on fluids given patient appears volume overloaded
* Minimizing fluid intake and following Cr to monitor renal function
* Considering renal consult for possible HD

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia
* Cardiac tamponade or rupture
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory status
* Renal failure or worsening of renal function
* Bleeding or coagulopathy due to DIC
* Liver failure or worsening of liver function
* Neurological complications, including myoclonus and seizures
* Infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
