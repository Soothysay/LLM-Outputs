   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 78-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2. He was transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with AST elevated to 458, and TropT 3.87. He has developed pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired, and is experiencing systolic heart failure with an EF of 20-25%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, and his INR is 3.9.

The patient's vital signs are:

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and a fib with RVR. The patient has 38-year-old bypass grafts, and the likelihood of restenosis is high. He has developed systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's EF is documented to be 20-25% at OSH, and it may worsen secondary to the large NSTEMI.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and the antibiotics started may not be effective against the infection.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's AST is elevated to 458, and it may worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's Crn is elevated, and it may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and it may worsen if not monitored closely.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in rapid ventricular rate, and it may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Type 2 DM: The patient's blood sugar levels are high, and it may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Restart heparin drip to prevent thrombosis.
2. Continue plavix 75mg daily to prevent platelet aggregation.
3. Continue high-dose aspirin to prevent platelet aggregation.
4. Hold high-dose statin given transaminitis.
5. Continue beta blockers to manage heart rate and blood pressure.
6. Hold ACE-I given acute on chronic renal failure and adverse reaction to lisinopril.
7. Plan for cardiac cath when INR is less than 1.5.
8. Trend CE's until peak.
9. Monitor electrolytes closely.
10. Continue to trend LFTs.
11. Hold statins for now.
12. Continue to trend with diuresis.
13. Monitor closely with heparin IV for chronic thrombocytopenia.
14. Consider adding vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP.
15. Continue levaquin started on [**2111-3-15**].
16. Add sliding scale insulin for DM Type 2.
17. Use metoprolol instead of home propranolol to rate control.
18. Restart home amlodipine as needed.
19. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and make adjustments to the treatment plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.

   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr

   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9

   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2, who was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and a fib with RVR. The patient has been experiencing rapid atrial fibrillation, which has been treated with metoprolol and diltiazem. The patient also has systolic heart failure with an EF of 20-25% and is at risk for further worsening. The patient has developed transaminitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia, including antibiotics and oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of systolic heart failure: The patient's EF is already low, and further worsening could lead to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency could worsen, leading to further decline in renal function and increased risk of mortality.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant therapy could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's a fib could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
6. Infection: The patient's pneumonia could worsen, leading to sepsis and increased risk of mortality.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's transaminitis and acute on chronic renal insufficiency could lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes and use of insulin could increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - However, if patient has fevers or worsening leukocytosis will
   consider broader coverage with vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM type 2, who was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR. He has developed systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He is currently receiving various medications, including heparin, metoprolol, and lasix, and has a diltiazem drip in place. His lab results show elevated AST and ALT levels, as well as an elevated INR. He is being monitored closely for signs of bleeding and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of his lab results and vital signs is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure is likely to worsen due to the large NSTEMI. Close monitoring of his cardiac function and fluid status is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to persist, and close monitoring of his heart rhythm and rate is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to worsen if not properly treated, and close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency is likely to worsen if not properly managed, and close monitoring of his renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely to worsen if not properly managed, and close monitoring of his liver function tests is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia is likely to worsen if not properly managed, and close monitoring of his platelet count is necessary to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve his chances of recovery."

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p coronary artery bypass grafting 39 years ago, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 102.1°F (38.9°C), heart rate 92 beats per minute, blood pressure 109/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 109/65 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,176 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 1,485 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count: WBC 8.2 K/uL, Hct 42.6%, platelet count 104 K/uL
	+ Electrolyte panel: Sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.9 mEq/L, chloride 99 mEq/L
	+ Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mEq/L
	+ Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 3.34 ng/mL
	+ Glucose: 296 mg/dL
* Imaging studies:
	+ Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size, and the estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0 L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18 mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently receiving antibiotics. He is also at risk for developing sepsis due to his underlying medical conditions.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which can increase his risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
3. Heart failure: The patient has severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, which can worsen his underlying kidney function.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia and is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which can increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing other infections, such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic complications.
3. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor for signs of heart failure and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor for signs of renal failure and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. He was diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired. The patient's condition has been unstable, with frequent changes in his medication regimen and vital signs.

The patient's 24-hour events include changes to his beta blocker medication, which has resulted in an increase in his heart rate and blood pressure. He has also had a negative 300 test, indicating that he did not receive an extra dose of lasix as planned. His INR is elevated at 3, and he has been given an additional dose of vitamin K. The patient's ID doctor has not been contacted for antibiotic approval.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.26.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his unstable condition. His peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, and his skin, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations are also not completed.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 8.2, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies show severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's cardiac index is depressed, and his estimated left ventricular filling pressure is elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may not be adequate, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacterial pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels may indicate ongoing myocardial damage, which can lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
6. Bleeding: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he receives anticoagulant therapy.
7. Infection: The patient's bacterial pneumonia may lead to secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 78-year-old male, was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has a history of coronary artery disease, CABG 39 years ago, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 109/65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute. His oxygen saturation is 92% on nasal cannula. He is receiving beta blockers, aspirin, and heparin, and has been started on metoprolol tartrate for rapid atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial infarction. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a creatine kinase (CK) level of 1046 IU/L and a CK-MB level of 31 IU/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) are also elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 416 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 157 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), show severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. The TTE also shows moderate right ventricular hypokinesis and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plan are as follows:

* NSTEMI: The patient is receiving beta blockers, aspirin, and heparin, and has been started on metoprolol tartrate for rapid atrial fibrillation.
* Systolic heart failure: The patient has severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and is receiving lasix boluses for diuresis.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is receiving metoprolol tartrate for rapid atrial fibrillation, and will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
* Pneumonia: The patient is receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and will continue to be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.
* Type 2 diabetes: The patient's home glyburide has been held, and he is receiving sliding scale insulin.
* Hypertension: The patient's home propranolol has been held, and he is receiving metoprolol instead.
* Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and he is being monitored closely.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is being monitored closely with diuresis.
* Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is being monitored closely with heparin IV.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's conditions and treatment plan include:

* Worsening heart failure: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction may worsen, leading to increased fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and sepsis.
* Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels may become unstable, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure may become unstable, leading to hypertensive crisis or stroke.
* Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests may continue to be elevated, leading to liver failure or encephalopathy.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to be low, leading to bleeding complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR. He has severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, and elevated estimated left ventricular filling pressures. He has also developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency and transaminitis. He is being treated with heparin drip, plavix, high-dose aspirin, and beta blockers. He is also being monitored for cardiac cath, EKG, and TTE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Worsening of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction
	* Development of cardiogenic shock
	* Increased risk of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia, including hospital-acquired pneumonia
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Respiratory failure
3. Renal Complications:
	* Worsening of acute on chronic renal insufficiency
	* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia, potentially worsening
	* Increased risk of bleeding complications
5. Infection Complications:
	* Development of sepsis or septic shock
	* Increased risk of multi-organ dysfunction
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
	* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Increased risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	* Development of seizures or encephalopathy

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiac, respiratory, renal, hematological, infection, gastrointestinal, and neurological status."

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM type 2, who was transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR. He has severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, and elevated estimated left ventricular filling pressures. He has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, at least mild pulmonary hypertension, and thoracic aortic dilation.

24-hour events:

* The patient's heart rate increased to 120s-130s despite being given Coreg 3.125 mg, and was subsequently switched back to Lopressor 50mg TID, which brought the heart rate down to 90s.
* The patient's blood pressure was 90s/50s, and was subsequently increased to 120s.
* The patient's INR was 3, and was given an additional 5mg PO Vit K.
* The patient's blood glucose levels were 296, 206, and 219, and was started on sliding scale insulin.

* Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
* Heart failure: The patient has severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, which could lead to heart failure.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, which could lead to renal failure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which could lead to bleeding complications.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled blood glucose levels, which could lead to hyperglycemia.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which could lead to infection.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day.
* Monitor electrolytes and blood glucose levels.
* Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib.
* Hold coumadin for likely cath today.
* Continue levaquin and vancomycin to cover HAP.
* Hold home glyburide and restart sliding scale insulin.
* Use metoprolol instead of home propranolol to rate control.
* Restart home amlodipine as needed.
* Continue to trend LFTs and hold statins for now.
* Continue to trend with diuresis and monitor closely with heparin IV.
* Monitor closely for signs of sepsis, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal 1.5 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - cath today
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - cath today
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He was transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has 38-year-old bypass grafts, which are likely to have restenosed given his type 2 diabetes. The patient's recent pneumonia may have precipitated the current event.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%
* Severe global hypokinesis
* New-onset edema, likely due to not taking daily lasix
* Elevated troponin levels
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Transaminitis
* Hypertension
* Type 2 diabetes
* Chronic thrombocytopenia

The patient is currently receiving treatment for:

* NSTEMI: catheterization today, plavix 75mg daily, high-dose aspirin, and beta blockers
* Systolic heart failure: lasix bolus daily for diuresis, goal -2 liters today, monitor electrolytes
* Atrial fibrillation: metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID, monitor on telemetry
* Pneumonia: levaquin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime
* Type 2 diabetes: hold home glyburide, sliding scale insulin
* Hypertension: metoprolol instead of home propranolol, restart home amlodipine as needed
* Transaminitis: trend LFTs, hold statins
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: continue to trend with diuresis
* Chronic thrombocytopenia: monitor closely with heparin IV

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening heart failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of infection due to pneumonia and chronic thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to diuretic therapy
* Hypoglycemia due to sliding scale insulin
* Hypotension due to beta blocker therapy
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus. He has a history of myocardial infarction and is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 90/71 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is receiving oxygen therapy via high-flow nebulization and has a central venous catheter in place.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the presence of bilateral wheezes and rhonchi, with no evidence of chest wall deformities or scoliosis. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no evidence of ascites or organomegaly. His skin is intact, with no evidence of stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or scars.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury. His glucose level is elevated, indicating possible hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and elevated troponin-T level suggest possible cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's bilateral wheezes and rhonchi suggest possible respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and elevated glucose level suggest possible gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin-T level suggest possible neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest possible infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest possible bleeding complications, such as bleeding or hemorrhage.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to detect any potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%), LCx, and RCA as well as SVG. The plan is to revise CABG next week.

The patient is currently experiencing systolic heart failure with an EF of 20-25% and severe global hypokinesis. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with metoprolol tartrate. He has a history of pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics, and is at risk for acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage. His creatinine levels are elevated, and his potassium levels are low. His platelet count is low, and he has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is severe, and he is at risk for further cardiac damage or complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, but he is at risk for further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for infection complications, such as sepsis, due to his pneumonia and cardiac condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Revision CABG next week
2. Continue high-dose aspirin
3. Consider starting on statin if transaminitis improves
4. Continue beta blockers
5. Monitor electrolytes
6. Continue lasix boluses for diuresis
7. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications
8. Monitor for signs of respiratory complications
9. Monitor for signs of renal complications
10. Monitor for signs of bleeding complications
11. Monitor for signs of infection complications

Overall, the patient is at high risk for medical complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%), LCx, and RCA, as well as SVG. The plan is to perform a revision CABG on Tuesday.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Systolic heart failure: The patient has an EF of 20-25% with severe global hypokinesis, likely worsening due to the large NSTEMI. He is being treated with lasix boluses for diuresis and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated with metoprolol tartrate for rate control, and will be transitioned to warfarin post-CABG.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia, and is being treated with levaquin, vancomycin, and ceftaz.
4. Type 2 DM: The patient's home glyburide has been held, and he is being treated with sliding scale insulin.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has likely developed transaminitis secondary to low cardiac output or relative hypotension, and is being monitored with trending LFTs.
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's Crn has increased to 1.6, and he is being treated with diuresis to manage his renal function.
7. Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia, and is being monitored closely with heparin IV.

The patient is also at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is being treated with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is being closely monitored, and he is at risk for cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac conditions.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and he is at risk for renal failure due to his underlying conditions.
4. Sepsis: The patient's infection is being closely monitored, and he is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying conditions.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying conditions and the use of anticoagulant medications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for serious medical complications, and will require close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall male with a weight of 73.4 kg, admitted to the ICU with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure, which revealed 3VD and stenosed venous grafts, requiring revision CABG surgery.

Current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 95 bpm (88-114 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/82 mmHg (94-149/60-97 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin, lasix, and sliding scale insulin. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and has received antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime.

Lab results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 8.2-9.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.8-43.3%
* Platelet count: 99-117 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3-1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 3.34-3.87 ng/mL
* Glucose: 178-296 mg/dL

The patient is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's physical examination is limited due to lack of assessment in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Pulmonary edema due to cardiac catheterization
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia
* Infection-related sepsis
* Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes and stress
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Thrombotic complications due to stenosed venous grafts
* Renal failure due to elevated creatinine levels

Further monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - cath today
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - cath today
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD and stenosed venous grafts, indicating the need for revision CABG. He also received IV lasix for pulmonary edema and had low PA pressures, which were addressed by adding 50cc/hr of NS. The patient's blood glucose levels are running high, likely due to stress and infection, and his heparin infusion was restarted.

Assessment:

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's EF is 20-25% with severe global hypokinesis, and it is likely worsening due to the large NSTEMI. The patient is at risk of developing heart failure with a high mortality rate.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of a fib, which is not well-controlled, and he is at risk of developing a fib with RVR, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and he is at risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can be severe and life-threatening.
4. Type 2 DM: The patient's blood glucose levels are high, and he is at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of HTN, and he is at risk of developing hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated LFTs, which can be a sign of liver dysfunction and increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
7. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury, which can be life-threatening.
8. Chronic Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and he is at risk of developing bleeding complications, especially with the use of anticoagulants.

Plan:

The patient will continue to receive medical treatment for his various conditions, including:

1. Revision CABG
2. IV lasix for diuresis
3. Metoprolol tartrate for rapid A fib
4. Levaquin and vancomycin for pneumonia
5. Sliding scale insulin for DM
6. Metoprolol for HTN
7. Hold statins for transaminitis
8. Monitor electrolytes and LFTs closely
9. Continue to trend with diuresis
10. Monitor for bleeding complications

The patient will require close monitoring and frequent assessments to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG 39 years ago, a fib, HTN, and DM Type 2. He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization (Cath) on [**2111-3-19**] 09:30 AM, which showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%), LCx, and RCA as well as SVG. The plan is for revision CABG on Tuesday.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Systolic Heart Failure: EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with severe global hypokinesis. The patient is likely worsening EF secondary to large NSTEMI. New flush edema was noted yesterday.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently rate-controlled. He had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
3. Pneumonia: Possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia given recent hospitalization last week for 'weakness.' The patient continues to spike temperatures overnight up to 102.1 yesterday.
4. Type 2 DM: The patient's home glyburide is being held, and sliding scale insulin is being used.
5. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension. Improving.
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: At OSH, Crn on presentation 1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5. This could also be secondary to low output state.
7. Chronic Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is being monitored closely with heparin IV.

The patient's lab results include:

* WBC: 8.2-9.9 K/uL
* Hct: 35.8-43.3%
* Plt: 99-117 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3-1.6 mg/dL
* TropT: 3.34-3.87 ng/mL
* Glucose: 178-296 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.0/60.9/1.4, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 1046/31/3.87, ALT / AST: 109/230, Alk Phos / T Bili: 97/1.2, Differential-Neuts: 73.3%, Lymph: 19.6%, Mono: 5.6%, Eos: 0.0%, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin
* Metoprolol tartrate
* Heparin IV
* Vancomycin
* Ceftazidime
* Lasix
* Sliding scale insulin

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: WDWN in NAD, oriented x3, mood, and affect appropriate
* HEENT: NCAT, sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI, conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa
* NECK: Supple with no elevation of JVP
* CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1, S2, no m/r/g, no thrills, lifts, no S3 or S4
* LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use, rhonchi heard in [**Doctor Last Name **] segment, no crackles or wheezes
* ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND, no HSM or tenderness, abd aorta not enlarged by palpation, no abdominial bruits
* EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e, no femoral bruits
* SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas, left upper extremity hematoma
* PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+, Femoral 2+, DP 1+, PT 1+; Left: Carotid 2+, Femoral 2+, DP 1+, PT 1+

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis from pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias from atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure from acute on chronic renal insufficiency
* Bleeding complications from chronic thrombocytopenia
* Infection from IV lines or catheters
* Respiratory failure from pneumonia or cardiac failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcer disease

Based on the patient's current condition and lab results, it is essential to continue monitoring his cardiac function, electrolytes, and renal function. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be continued, and his glucose levels should be closely monitored. The patient's platelet count should be monitored regularly, and his heparin IV dose should be adjusted as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* NSTEMI: The patient had a large NSTEMI, which is likely causing his systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
* Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a documented EF of 20-25% at OSH, which is likely worsening due to the large NSTEMI.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is being treated with levaquin, vancomycin, and ceftaz.
* Type 2 DM: The patient has type 2 DM, which is being managed with sliding scale insulin.
* Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting of a large NSTEMI.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, which is being managed with diuresis.
* Chronic Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored closely with heparin IV.

The patient's plan includes:

* Revision CABG next week
* Continue high-dose aspirin
* Consider starting on statin if transaminitis improves
* No Plavix
* Continue beta blockers
* Continue lasix bolus daily for diuresis, goal -1 L/day
* Monitor electrolytes
* Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider increasing to 100 mg QID
* Monitor on telemetry
* On heparin gtt, transition to warfarin post CABG
