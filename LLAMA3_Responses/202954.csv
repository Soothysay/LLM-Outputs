   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2159-7-29**]
   - Coughed up ~10ccs [**Known firstname **] red blood at 11pm.  Morning [**7-30**] coughing up
   small amount dark brown substance.  Larger amount aspirated from NG
   Tube  ? swallowed blood.
   .
   - CT Head obtained, preliminary read:  bilateral basal ganglion
   hypodensity concerning for acute infarction (confirmed with Radiology
   Fellow), bilateral involvement consistent with anoxic event, atleast
   3-4 hours post event; MRI would be helpful if patient stable
   - Given 2L D5 with 150mEq bicarbonate with only minimal improvement in
   urine output; able to wean dopamine significantly but patient became
   bradycardic with complete discontinuation
   - DNR status confirmed with family
   .
   - Thoracic Surgery consulted to manage chest tube, though appears port
   in chest wall, reportedly fine without air-leak; continue as we are
   - Neurology contact, will have formal consult on [**Name (NI) 501**] s/p re-warming
   but recommended EEG in interim
   - A-line placed for improved BP monitoring and weaning of pressors

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's condition is complicated by a small right-sided pneumothorax, which has been treated with a chest tube, and he is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating possible myocardial infarction, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) shows signs of acute ischemia. He also has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, indicating cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. He is being managed with aggressive bronchodilator therapy and is on a cooling protocol to manage his body temperature.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CABG and atrial fibrillation, combined with his current cardiac arrest and elevated cardiac enzymes, increase his risk of developing cardiac complications such as ventricular fibrillation, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis, combined with his COPD and asthma, increase his risk of developing respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation, combined with his current low blood pressure and poor perfusion, increase his risk of developing neurological complications such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, or stroke.
4. Renal complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and current poor urine output increase his risk of developing renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's current intubation and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing infectious complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and to adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, followed by CPR and ACLS. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is anticoagulated. The patient has been on a cooling protocol for 18 hours and has now been rewarmed. He is currently on pressors and has a cardiac arrest team involved. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, which was initially difficult to ventilate, and he has a history of asthma and bronchospasm. He also has a small right-sided pneumothorax, which has been treated with a chest tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to the cardiac arrest, and he has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is currently on a pacemaker. He also has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Ischemic event due to cardiac arrest
	* Ventricular fibrillation
	* Cardiac tamponade
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia
	* Respiratory failure
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Chronic kidney disease progression
4. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures
	* Stroke
	* Cerebral edema
5. Infectious complications:
	* Pneumonia
	* Sepsis
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Pressor therapy to maintain blood pressure
2. Cooling protocol to prevent further cardiac damage
3. Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function
4. Cardiac enzymes monitoring to assess cardiac function
5. Electrolyte management to prevent arrhythmias
6. Renal function monitoring to assess kidney function
7. Neurological monitoring to assess brain function
8. Infection prevention measures to prevent VAP and other infections

The patient's code status is DNR, and he is intubated. The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and a family meeting has been planned to discuss his prognosis and clinical outcomes."

   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.
   - continue cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6 hours warming
   (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given EMS records,
   will presume 0200, so cool until [**2150**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and subsequent CPR/ACLS. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 7 years ago, s/p ICD implantation 5 years ago, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He also has a history of COPD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is intubated and ventilated with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
* He has a baseline temperature of 34.1°C (93.4°F) and a heart rate of 66 beats per minute.
* His blood pressure is 94/62 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation is 99%.
* He has a white blood cell count of 16.9 x 10^9/L and a platelet count of 180 x 10^9/L.
* His troponin-T level is 0.53 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL.
* He has a pH of 7.27, a pCO2 of 46 mmHg, and a base excess of -5 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypothermia: The patient's baseline temperature is 34.1°C (93.4°F), which is below normal.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and ventilated, and his ABG values indicate respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a PEA arrest, and his troponin-T level is elevated.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is poor.
* Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is mildly elevated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest and elevated troponin-T level increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal insufficiency and elevated creatinine level increase his risk of developing renal failure.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis and respiratory acidosis increase his risk of developing metabolic acidosis.
* Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and ventilator use increase his risk of developing pneumonia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing cooling protocol for 18 hours
* Weaning down on pressors, starting with dopamine
* Ordering a continuous 48-hour bedside EEG
* Consulting with a neurologist for further evaluation and management
* Scheduling an albuterol and ipratropium treatment
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting ventilation as needed
* Ordering a repeat CXR and serial ABGs
* Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and adjusting treatment as needed
* Consulting with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management
* Ordering a TTE and obtaining outside records
* Monitoring the patient's renal status and adjusting treatment as needed
* Ordering a repeat CXR and monitoring the patient's chest tube output"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is anticoagulated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support with a high auto PEEP and PIP. He has a history of asthma and bronchospasm on exam.
* Cardiac: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% and is on a ventricular-paced pacemaker. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and has had two episodes of inappropriate ICD firing.
* Neurological: The patient is non-responsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub, with minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli in his left lower extremity. His pupils are fixed and dilated bilaterally.
* Renal: The patient has renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.2 and is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given his history of PEA arrest.
* Metabolic: The patient has mixed acidosis with lactic acidosis and is at risk for respiratory acidosis.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for further cardiac damage.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further neurological damage.
* Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further renal damage.
* Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic status is unstable, and he is at risk for further metabolic acidosis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning down on pressors, starting with dopamine, and keeping mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
* Ordering a continuous 48-hour bedside EEG per protocol.
* Scheduling a formal neurology consultation and family meeting.
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's metabolic status and adjusting treatment as needed.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is to remain in the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry

   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of
   care - have discussed this plan extensively with wife and son

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 7 years ago and was on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and was placed on pressors and a cooling protocol due to cardiac arrest. He was rewarmed and is currently being weaned off pressors. He has a small right-sided pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube. He also has a history of asthma and COPD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 34.1°C, heart rate 66 bpm, blood pressure 94/62 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is currently on pressors and has a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min.
* Neurological status: The patient is nonresponsive to verbal stimuli and has a fixed and dilated pupils. He has minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli in his left lower extremity.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 16.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 12.1 g/dL, and platelet count is 180 x 10^9/L. His creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 20 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and may require further respiratory support.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk for further cardiac events.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further renal support.
* Neurological damage: The patient's nonresponsive state and fixed and dilated pupils may indicate neurological damage, and he may require further neurological evaluation.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged stay in the ICU and his underlying medical conditions.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of cardiac arrest may increase his risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off pressors and adjusting his mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
* Monitoring his neurological status and adjusting his sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continuing his antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection.
* Monitoring his renal function and adjusting his fluid management as needed.
* Continuing his cooling protocol and monitoring for signs of hypothermia.
* Considering the patient's DNR status and discussing withdrawal of care with his family if he does not show meaningful neurological improvement."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT (final read): Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity,
   specifically involving the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in
   the current mechanism of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic
   brain injury. Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically
   feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and subsequent CPR/ACLS. He has a history of CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He is currently intubated and on pressors and a cooling protocol.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: Intubated, ventilated, and requiring high auto PEEP and PIP due to bronchospasm. RSBI is 311, and PIP and plateau pressures are elevated.
* Cardiovascular: EF is 25%, and the patient is on pressors. The patient has a history of CAD and CABG, and cardiac enzymes are elevated, but it is unclear whether this is due to an ischemic event or compressions.
* Neurological: The patient has basal ganglia damage consistent with anoxic brain injury (ABI). Neuro exam shows some brainstem reflexes intact, but the patient is non-responsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub.
* Renal: The patient has baseline renal insufficiency, and it is likely that there is some component of ATN due to PEA arrest x 2. UOP is poor.
* Fever: The patient spiked a temperature of 101.7F this morning, and pan-cultured. UA is positive for LE, and the patient is on vanco/zosyn for broad coverage.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for further cardiac events, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
* Neurological complications: The patient's ABI is a significant concern, and he is at risk for further neurological decline.
* Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further decline and potential need for dialysis.
* Infection: The patient's fever and positive UA are concerning for infection, and he is at risk for further infection and sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and potential for bleeding are concerns, particularly in light of his recent PEA arrest and CPR/ACLS.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning down on pressors, starting with dopamine, to maintain a MAP > 60.
* Continuing cooling protocol for 18 hours, then warming for 6 hours.
* Repeat CXR to assess for VAP and other complications.
* Repeat EKG to monitor cardiac status.
* Monitoring of uop and Cr to assess renal function.
* F/u blood and urine cultures to assess for infection.
* F/u neuro exam and EEG to monitor neurological status.
* F/u TTE read to assess cardiac function.
* Plan for family meeting to discuss code status and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.
   - Incr TV, CVP 8-9
   - BP dropping slightly (MAP 80s --> 70s), requiring incr pressors
   - CT oozing blood today, CXR shows no PTX and CT nearly out. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] to
   come pull CT

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male who presented with acute episode of respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and is currently on pressors and cooling protocol. The patient has a history of CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurologically, the patient is non-responsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub, with minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli in the left lower extremity, and no other purposeful movement. Pupils are non-reactive.
* Cardiovascularly, the patient has a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and is currently on dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg or higher.
* Respiratorily, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (TV) of 650 mL, and is experiencing respiratory acidosis.
* Renally, the patient has baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to the PEA arrest.
* Metabolically, the patient has lactic acidosis, and is also experiencing mixed acid-base disorder.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.5-17.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 153 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1-3.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.56 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 3.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 5.0 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) shows no pulmonary thromboembolism (PTX), and the CT scan shows bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, which is concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
* Electrocardiogram (EKG) shows no localized ischemia, but cardiac enzymes are elevated, which may be due to compressions.

The patient's medications include:

* Dopamine: 5 mcg/Kg/min
* Norepinephrine: 0.15 mcg/Kg/min
* Pantoprazole (Protonix): 40 mg IV every 8 hours
* Albuterol/Ipratroprium: 0.5 mL every 4 hours, and as needed
* Coumadin: therapeutic dose
* Aspirin: 81 mg daily
* Metoprolol: 25 mg twice daily

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure due to respiratory acidosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Cardiac arrest due to primary cardiac or pulmonary source
* Renal failure due to ATN and hypovolemia
* Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis and respiratory acidosis
* Neurological impairment due to anoxic brain injury
* Infection due to central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and VAP

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning down on pressors, starting with dopamine, while maintaining a MAP of 60 mmHg or higher
* Order for continuous 48-hour bedside EEG per protocol
* Formal neuro consultation this morning to discuss prognosis and clinical outcomes
* SW consult for family coping
* Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
* Family meeting this morning to discuss plan of care and prognosis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting at noon
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - RSBI 311
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   #FEVER: Spiked 101.7 on [**7-31**] 1am. Pan-cultured. UA positive for LE, mod
   bacteria. On vanco/zosyn for broad coverage. Lines not grossly
   infected, CXR no e/o VAP.
   -          f/u blood and urine cx
   -          daily CXR
   .
   #NEURO: CT shows basal ganglia damage c/w ABI. Neuro following. Neuro
   exam shows some brainstem reflexes intact (pupils reactive, L corneal
   reflex).
   -          48 hr EEG complete at 10 this AM, f/u interpretation
   -          - f/u neuro rec
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   VAP:  HOB, Chlorhexidate
   Communication:  Plan to have family meeting this morning
   Code status:  DNR (patient intubated)
   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and anoxic brain injury. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 650 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient has a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) of 311.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is on pressors (dopamine and norepinephrine) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. The patient has a cardiac arrest team involved, and the patient is enrolled in a steroid clinical trial.
* Neurological status: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 and is unresponsive to verbal stimuli. The patient has a CT scan showing bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, which is concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
* Hematological status: The patient has a platelet count of 153 K/uL and a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL.
* Renal status: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and is at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's cardiogenic shock and anoxic brain injury.
* Infectious status: The patient has a temperature of 101.7°F and has been pan-cultured. The patient has a urine culture positive for Leuconostoc, a moderate-bacteria organism. The patient is on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for broad-spectrum coverage.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the patient's current respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient is at risk for further cardiogenic shock due to the patient's underlying coronary artery disease and the patient's current cardiogenic shock.
* Anoxic brain injury: The patient is at risk for further anoxic brain injury due to the patient's current hypotension and the patient's underlying anoxic brain injury.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is at risk for further AKI due to the patient's cardiogenic shock, anoxic brain injury, and the patient's current renal insufficiency.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the patient's current temperature and the patient's positive urine culture.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning down on pressors and starting to monitor the patient's MAP.
* Repeating the patient's CXR and RSBI to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjusting the patient's sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's renal function and adjusting the patient's fluid management as needed.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's infectious status and adjusting the patient's antibiotic therapy as needed.
* Scheduling a family meeting to discuss the patient's plan of care and code status."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.
   - Incr TV, CVP 8-9
   - BP dropping slightly (MAP 80s --> 70s), requiring incr pressors

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and was resuscitated with CPR and ACLS. He has a history of CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological: The patient is nonresponsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub, with bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity on head CT, concerning for an anoxic brain injury. He has extensor posturing with internal rotation, minimal internal rotation to nailbed pressure, and no response in the left leg.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated, with a RSBI of 311 and elevated PIP and plateau pressures. He has a history of asthma and bronchospasm on exam.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG, with elevated cardiac enzymes, but no localized ischemia on ECGs. His EF is 25%, and he has poor perfusion.
* Fever: The patient spiked a temperature of 101.7°F and has a positive urine culture for LE and moderate bacteria.
* Renal: The patient has baseline renal insufficiency, likely exacerbated by ATN due to PEA arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Severe respiratory failure requiring increased ventilator support or intubation
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock
* Neurological deterioration, including worsening of anoxic brain injury or seizures
* Infection, including sepsis or VAP, given the patient's positive urine culture and fever
* Renal failure, requiring dialysis or further management
* Metabolic acidosis, requiring adjustment of ventilator settings and electrolyte management
