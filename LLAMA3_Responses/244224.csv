   masses, not fully evaluated.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o man with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and high
   likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.
   Respiratory failure
          It is not exactly clear what his parenchymal opacities
   represent.  He may have ARDS, community/nursing-home-acquired
   pneumonia, lymphangitic spread of tumor, or reactivation of
   tuberculosis (given right apical findings, foreign-born status,
   cachexia,
treatment-resistant
 pneumonia, and possible new relative
   immunosuppression from malignancy.
          Ventilation per ARDSnet strategy, although this is
   complicated by his emphysema.  At present, he has some dyssynchrony
   with the ventialtor and we will pursue additional sedation and try to
   match applied PEEP to instrinsic PEEP.  Remove extension tubing to
   decrease dead space.
   Pneumonia
          Although not clear that this is bacterial pneumonia, we will
   treat broadly for nursing-home-acquired pneumonia.
          Respiratory isolation and endotracheal aspirates for AFB x
   3.
   Possible malignancy
          Unable to safely bronch at present
 will check endotracheal
   aspirate for cytology
   Septic Shock
          Goal-directed therapy, but adjust CVP goal to ~15.  Use LR
   for resusctitive fluuid
          Measure noninvasive cardiac parameters with Vigileo.  If low
   CO, dobutamine
          Doesn
t meet criteria for steroids
          Would not pursue activated protein C while he is on heparin.
   Acidosis
          Mixed nongap metabolic and respiratory
 management as
   detailed above, including LR for further fluids
   Possible pulmonary embolism
          I doubt that the CT findings represent a PE as the major
   etiology of his respiratory failure.  Check LENIs and if no clot d/c
   heparin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is an 87-year-old man with respiratory failure and shock, likely due to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and possibly new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.
* The patient has a right hilar mass and possible pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography (CT) scan.
* He is receiving invasive ventilation with ARDSnet settings, and his respiratory support includes a combination of mechanical ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
* The patient has a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis, which is being managed with fluid resuscitation and ventilation adjustments.
* He has a history of septic shock, which is being treated with goal-directed therapy, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and antibiotic treatment.
* The patient has a right apical finding, which may indicate reactivation of tuberculosis, given his foreign-born status, cachexia, treatment-resistant pneumonia, and possible new relative immunosuppression from malignancy.
* He has a probable bilateral adrenal mass, which has not been fully evaluated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his ARDS, pneumonia, and possible PE.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Malignancy: The patient's new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy may lead to further complications, such as metastasis or progression of the disease.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may not respond to treatment, leading to further complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
5. PE: The patient's possible PE may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary infarction or respiratory failure.
6. Acidosis: The patient's mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or organ dysfunction.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and acidosis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as kidney or liver failure.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status."

   Imaging: CTA WET READ
   4 x 5cm rt hilar neoplasm causing marked compression and possible
   invasion of
   the central rt bronchovascular bundle and complete obliteration of the
   bronchus intermedius.  Addtional small filling defect is noted within a
   rll
   segmental branch which may represent a small non occlusive emboli.
   distal
   branches not evaluated due to motion which also obscures eval of lung
   parenchyma.  there is marked pneumonia/postobstructive pneumonitis of
   portion
   of the rll and rml.  marked bronchial wall thickening and scattred
   opacities
   with interstitial thickening which are likley infectious but can not
   exclude lymphangitic spread of tumor.  small b/l effusions with lt
   compression
   atelectasis.  severe emphysema.  Thyroid nodules.  probable b/l adrenal
   masses, not fully evaluated.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   - will also assess TTE to r/o cardiac cause of hypotension
   # ID
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,
   granulomatous findings on Chest CT.
   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3
   # Acid / Base status
   Resp acidosis w/ non gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to
   hyperchloremic met ac from liters of NS.
   Will convert resuscitation to LR and follow panel, abgs
   # ARF
   Resolved w/ IVFs
   Cont to trend, likely was pre-renal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   - will also assess TTE to r/o cardiac cause of hypotension
   # ID
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,
   granulomatous findings on Chest CT.
   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer who presents with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a central right bronchovascular bundle neoplasm causing compression and possible invasion, which is likely the primary cause of his respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* HR: 95-116 bpm
* BP: 94/67 mmHg
* RR: 32-38 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* CVP: 12 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 16.1-29.0 K/uL
* Hct: 34-38.2%
* Plt: 325-379 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-1.2 mg/dL
* TCO2: 17-18 mmol/L
* Glucose: 83-159 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis likely due to post-pneumonia, and the team is working to improve oxygenation, match PEEP to auto-PEEP, and adjust sedation. The patient is also being treated for shock with goal-directed therapy, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors.

The patient's acid-base status is compromised, with a respiratory acidosis and non-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from liters of normal saline.

The patient has a diagnosis of acute kidney injury (ARF) which has resolved with IV fluids, and the team is monitoring the patient's kidney function closely.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 400-450 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis
* Shock
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
* Respiratory acidosis
* Non-gap metabolic acidosis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Endobronchial bleeding
* Intracranial bleeding
* Cardiac causes of hypotension
* Pulmonary embolism
* Tuberculosis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue goal-directed therapy for sepsis and shock
* Increase CVP goal to 14-16 mmHg
* Focus pressors on norepinephrine and vasopressin
* Consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO
* Assess for intracranial bleeding
* Continue empiric antibiotics for pulmonary source of sepsis
* Monitor acid-base status and adjust resuscitation fluids accordingly
* Continue to trend kidney function and adjust IV fluids as necessary

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   -          D/C HEPARIN
   -          Wean vent settings
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   # ID
   INFLUENAZA B
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,

   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3
   # Acid / Base status
   Resp acidosis w/ non gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to
   hyperchloremic met ac from liters of NS.
   Will convert resuscitation to LR and follow panel, abgs

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer, who presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza B, and his respiratory failure is likely due to lung collapse with a hilar mass, post-obstructive pneumonitis, and non-obstructive infection. He has a small sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, which is unlikely to be contributing significantly to his hypoxemia.

The patient's acid-base status is impaired, with a respiratory acidosis and non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from liters of normal saline. He has acute kidney injury, which has resolved with intravenous fluids.

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his ventilator settings are being adjusted to match his auto-PEEP. He is receiving goal-directed therapy, including vasopressors, and is being considered for activated protein C therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of influenza B and respiratory failure increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral lung infiltrates on CT scan increase his risk of developing ARDS.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral lung infiltrates on CT scan increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's small sub-segmental pulmonary embolism may not be contributing significantly to his hypoxemia, but it still increases his risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
5. Heart Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral lung infiltrates on CT scan increase his risk of developing heart failure.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may not have fully resolved, and he may still be at risk of developing AKI.
7. Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy: The patient's sepsis increases his risk of developing sepsis-induced coagulopathy.
8. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral lung infiltrates on CT scan increase his risk of developing infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, empyema, or abscesses.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential pathogens.
2. Adjust ventilator settings to match the patient's auto-PEEP.
3. Consider activated protein C therapy to reduce the risk of sepsis-induced coagulopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to trend the patient's kidney function and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Consider adding antiviral therapy to treat the patient's influenza B infection.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Consider adding steroids to reduce the risk of ARDS."

   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer who presents with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has a right hilar mass with postobstructive atelectasis and probable postobstructive pneumonitis, as well as a small nonobstructive thrombus in a branch of the pulmonary artery. He has a severe emphysema and suggestion of right-sided heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm
* Blood pressure: 98/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has a poor technical quality echocardiogram due to ventilator and sub-optimal echo windows. The left ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen.

The patient has a CT scan showing a right hilar mass with postobstructive atelectasis and probable postobstructive pneumonitis, as well as a small nonobstructive thrombus in a branch of the pulmonary artery. He also has a severe emphysema and suggestion of right-sided heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 29.0 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 33%
* Plt: 379 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2 mg/dL
* TCO2: 17 mmol/L
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Shock
* Acid-base status: resp acidosis with non-gap metabolic acidosis
* ARF: resolved with IVFs
* DVT: small sub-segmental PE
* ID: influenza B, likely pulmonary source to sepsis
* TB: concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country**], immunocompromise, granulomatous findings on Chest CT

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further respiratory failure
* Worsening of shock
* Increased risk of DVT and PE
* Development of TB
* Increased risk of sepsis and septic shock
* Potential for intracranial bleeding with unknown brain mets
* Potential for endobronchial bleed with PA infiltration
* Potential for worsening of acid-base status and ARF"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The FiO2 has been decreased to 60% and the PEEP has been set to 10 cmH2O. The patient has a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a cardiac output of 3.9 L/min and a central venous pressure of 16 mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressors, including norepinephrine and vasopressin, to support blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts in the urine. The creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 30.8 mg/dL.
* Infections: The patient has a positive influenza B viral antigen test and is being treated with oseltamivir. The patient also has a suspected post-obstructive pneumonia and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Imaging: The patient has a computed tomography (CT) scan showing a right hilar mass with post-obstructive atelectasis and probable post-obstructive pneumonitis. The patient also has bilateral adrenal masses consistent with metastases.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation with a goal of weaning FiO2 to 40% within the next 24 hours.
* Continuing vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotics as necessary.
* Monitoring for signs of acute kidney injury and adjusting fluid management accordingly.
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting ventilation settings as necessary.
* Considering further diagnostic testing, such as bronchoscopy or echocardiogram, to evaluate the patient's respiratory and cardiac status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
* Sepsis: The patient has a suspected post-obstructive pneumonia and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases the risk of sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and further deterioration could lead to renal failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient is receiving vasopressors to support blood pressure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability.
* Infections: The patient has a positive influenza B viral antigen test and is being treated with oseltamivir, which increases the risk of secondary infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and shock, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). They have a flu diagnosis with sputum containing Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), and are on two pressors (dobutamine and norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure. The patient has a language barrier and is sedated, making it difficult to obtain a detailed medical history.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 0.7. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (29.0 x 10^9/L), elevated lactate level (2.4 mmol/L), and low serum albumin (30.8 g/dL). Their chest X-ray shows worsening bibasilar infiltrates and effusions, with a right hilar mass persisting.

The patient has a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition via tube feeds, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications:

1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or lung transplantation.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may lead to secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's septic shock and cardiovascular instability may lead to further hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and tachycardia.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further complications, such as muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired wound healing.
7. Immune suppression: The patient's septic shock and pneumonia may lead to immune suppression, increasing the risk of secondary infections and further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o man with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and high
   likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.
   Respiratory failure
          Likely secondary to influenza, possibly with bacterial
   superinfection
          Vancomycin, Zosyn, azithro until cx back
          Ventilation per ARDSnet strategy, although this is
   complicated by his emphysema.  More synchronous today, and oxygenation
   improving.
          Complete MTB rule-out, although much less likely given (+)
   flu findings
   Possible malignancy
          Unable to safely bronch at present
          When FiO2 down a bit further, consider further investigation
   Septic Shock
          Goal-directed therapy, but adjust CVP goal to ~15.  Use LR
   for resusctitive fluuid
          Measure noninvasive cardiac parameters with Vigileo.
          Doesn
t meet criteria for steroids
          Would not pursue activated protein C given the abutment of
   his tumor with his airway
   Possible pulmonary embolism
          Given negative LENIs and re-read of CT, d/c IV heparin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and shock. He has a history of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and a high likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm (94-108)
* Blood pressure: 101/53 mmHg (69-112/45-71)
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (28-34)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 16 mmHg (11-16)

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.7 and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He is also receiving vasopressors, including dobutamine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 29.0 x 10^9/L (22.4-29.0)
* Hct: 33% (30.8-38.2)
* Plt: 379 x 10^9/L (331-379)
* Cr: 1.2 mg/dL (1.4-1.2)
* TCO2: 18 mmHg (16-20)
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL (104-159)

The patient's imaging studies show worsening bibasilar infiltrates and effusions on CXR, and a right hilar mass on CT.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: likely secondary to influenza, possibly with bacterial superinfection
* Possible malignancy: unable to safely bronch at present, consider further investigation when FiO2 is down a bit further
* Septic shock: goal-directed therapy, adjust CVP goal to ~15, use LR for resuscitative fluid
* Possible pulmonary embolism: given negative LENIs and re-read of CT, d/c IV heparin
* ICU care: start tube feeds, regular insulin sliding scale, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening lung injury, respiratory acidosis, and hypercapnia
* Sepsis: further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, cardiac dysfunction, and coagulopathy
* Malignancy: progression of disease, spread to other organs, and potential complications from treatment
* Pulmonary embolism: further embolization, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular dysfunction
* ICU-acquired complications: such as delirium, pressure ulcers, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections."
