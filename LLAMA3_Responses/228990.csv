 EKG - At [**2119-4-6**] 04:38 AM
   - started warming at 5pm
   - EEG: burst suppression, no seizure activity
   - UOP decreasing and hypotensive in setting of medications below
   - 1 am paralytics weaned and the patient started seizing with myclonic

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was found unresponsive at home and had a witnessed cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the emergency medical services (EMS). He was rapidly cooled, but his neurologic status remains unresponsive with myoclonus, suggesting severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of the presentation is unclear. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension, and is taking several medications, including anti-arrhythmics, beta-blockers, and statins.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient has already experienced a cardiac arrest, and there is a risk of recurrent arrest due to his underlying cardiac conditions and medications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk of further hypotension due to his cardiac condition, medications, and hypovolemic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but he may require further respiratory support due to his underlying lung disease and potential aspiration.
4. Neurological damage: The patient's myoclonus and unresponsiveness suggest severe hypoxic injury, and there is a risk of further neurological damage due to his underlying cardiac condition and medications.
5. Infection: The patient has a central venous line and arterial line, which increases his risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to his underlying condition and medications.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are abnormal, and there is a risk of further liver dysfunction due to his underlying condition and medications.
8. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can worsen his underlying condition and increase his risk of further complications.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin, which increases his risk of hypoglycemia.
10. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving fluids, which increases his risk of fluid overload and further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide supportive care as needed.
2. Wean the patient off sedation and paralysis to assess his neurological status.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
4. Consider further imaging studies, such as a head CT or MRI, to assess the patient's neurological status.
5. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid regimen as needed.
7. Consider further testing, such as a stress test or echocardiogram, to assess the patient's cardiac function.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
9. Consider further treatment options, such as antibiotics or antivirals, if the patient develops an infection.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a likely VF arrest of unknown cause. The patient has been sedated and is unresponsive due to encephalopathy. The patient's history was obtained from family and hospital records. The patient has a history of allergies to ibuprofen, procainamide, sotalol, and amiodarone. The patient's medications include insulin, midazolam, propofol, dilantin, lorazepam, and fosphenytoin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a temperature of 35.3°C. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 248 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and the patient has a blood glucose level of 154 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show periventricular hypodensity on CT head, which may be chronic or acute, and cannot be excluded as a hypoperfusion injury. The patient's microbiology results are pending, and the patient's ECG is abnormal.

The patient's diagnosis is seizure with status epilepticus, diabetes mellitus type I, and cardiac arrest. The patient's treatment plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control with insulin infusion, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient may be at risk for respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently in atrial fibrillation. The patient may be at risk for recurrent cardiac arrest due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of medications.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizure activity and is currently on medications to control seizures. The patient may be at risk for recurrent seizure activity due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of medications.
4. Infection: The patient's microbiology results are pending, and the patient may be at risk for infection due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of invasive devices.
5. Neurological damage: The patient's encephalopathy and seizure activity may be causing neurological damage, which could lead to long-term cognitive and motor deficits.
6. Blood glucose control: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for blood glucose control issues due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of insulin infusion.
7. Fluid management: The patient's fluid balance is abnormal, and the patient may be at risk for fluid overload or dehydration due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of medications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to prevent or manage these potential medical complications."

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and was rapidly cooled. He remains unresponsive and has been sedated and paralyzed due to myoclonus. His laboratory results show elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels, suggesting myocardial injury. He has also been treated for atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic injury: The patient's prolonged period of hypoxia may have caused significant brain damage, leading to his current unresponsive state.
2. Myoclonic seizures: The patient's myoclonus may be a sign of post-hypoxic myoclonic epilepsy, which can be a complication of hypoxic injury.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and ventricular ectopy may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of blood in his nasogastric tube may indicate ongoing bleeding.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be a sign of underlying cardiac or vasopressor dysfunction, which could lead to further complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be a sign of underlying diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia, which could lead to further complications.
8. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate underlying liver disease or medication-induced liver damage, which could lead to further complications.
9. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis may be a sign of underlying respiratory or metabolic disease, which could lead to further complications.

Plan:

1. Continue therapeutic hypothermia with a goal temperature of 34.5°C.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and treat any arrhythmias that occur.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluids and vasopressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin infusion as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust his respiratory support as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation and paralysis regimen as needed.
8. Consider the patient's underlying cardiac and vasopressor dysfunction and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
9. Consider the patient's underlying liver disease and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
10. Consider the patient's underlying acid-base disorder and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now

   BPH

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10742**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was in atrial fibrillation and had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was rapidly cooled, but his neurologic status remains concerning for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of his presentation is unclear.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He takes three anti-arrhythmic medications, including digoxin, diltiazem, and atenolol. He also takes metformin and glipizide for diabetes.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Neurologically, he is comatose with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He has myoclonic jerks and is not responding to stimuli.
* Cardiologically, he is in atrial fibrillation and has a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
* Respiratorily, he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.
* Hemodynamically, he is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 81/42 mmHg.
* Metabolically, he has hyperglycemia and is receiving insulin infusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Severe hypoxic injury: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and cardiac arrest may have caused severe brain injury, which could lead to long-term cognitive impairment or even death.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and PEA arrest may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to further arrhythmias and cardiac complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and cardiac arrest may have triggered a systemic inflammatory response, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hypotension and cardiac arrest may have caused gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and cardiac arrest may have caused respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications.
6. Infection: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and cardiac arrest may have triggered an infection, which could lead to further complications.
7. Organ failure: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and cardiac arrest may have caused organ failure, which could lead to further complications.

Plan:

1. Continue cooling for 12-24 hours, then re-evaluate neurologic status.
2. Continue mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 80%.
3. Continue insulin infusion for hyperglycemia.
4. Monitor for signs of sepsis and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory failure.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and organ failure.
7. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as echocardiogram and brain imaging, to determine the cause of the patient's presentation."

   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult

Summary:

The patient was admitted to the ICU following a VF arrest. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements, with a CXR demonstrating right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse. The patient's sputum has become purulent, and they have developed a fever of 104°F, prompting the administration of empirical antibiotics. The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, as they are paralyzed and sedated. The patient's labs are concerning for sepsis, with a WBC count of 16.5 and a CRP of 38 mg/dL. The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a troponin-T level of 0.09 ng/mL and a CK-MB level of 8 ng/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's purulent sputum and elevated CRP level suggest the possibility of sepsis. This could lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and coagulopathy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements suggest respiratory failure, which could be further exacerbated by sepsis.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is a significant concern, particularly given the elevated troponin-T and CK-MB levels. This could be a sign of ongoing myocardial damage or infarction.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's paralysis and sedation may be masking underlying neurological deficits, which could be exacerbated by sepsis or cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's purulent sputum and elevated CRP level suggest the possibility of a pulmonary infection, which could lead to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
6. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes and elevated blood glucose levels suggest the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis, which could lead to further metabolic derangements and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empirical antibiotics and antifungals for the patient's suspected pulmonary infection.
2. Consider adding vasopressors to support the patient's blood pressure, as their troponin-T level is elevated.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, as their paralysis and sedation may be masking underlying neurological deficits.
4. Consider consulting a pulmonologist for further management of the patient's respiratory failure.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and consider adding insulin to their regimen to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Consider consulting a cardiologist for further management of the patient's cardiac arrest and cardiac dysfunction."

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was in cardiac arrest for 10-15 minutes before being defibrillated, and has been in the ICU for 24 hours. He has been experiencing myoclonus, a condition characterized by sudden, involuntary muscle contractions, and is currently comatose. He has also been experiencing hypoxia, a condition characterized by low levels of oxygen in the blood, and has required increasing levels of oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking several medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin, and has a history of non-compliance with his medication regimen.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation has been low, requiring increasing levels of oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
* Myoclonus: The patient is experiencing sudden, involuntary muscle contractions, which may be a sign of hypoxic brain injury.
* Coma: The patient is currently comatose, which may be a sign of severe brain injury.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient was in cardiac arrest for 10-15 minutes before being defibrillated, which may have caused significant damage to his heart and brain.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxia may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Neurological complications: The patient's coma and myoclonus may be signs of severe brain injury, which could lead to long-term disability or death.
* Infection: The patient's hypoxia and coma may increase his risk of infection, which could be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

* Continue oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including his level of consciousness, pupillary response, and motor function.
* Consider performing a brain CT or MRI scan to evaluate the extent of any brain injury.
* Consider performing a cardiac echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
* Consider performing a swallow evaluation to assess the patient's risk of aspiration.
* Consider performing a wound care evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers.
* Consider performing a nutritional assessment to evaluate the patient's need for enteral or parenteral nutrition."

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .
   FEN:
   - No fluid for now
   - Electrolytes: Keep K > 4 and Mg > 2
   - No nutrition for tonight
   .
   ACCESS: PIV, femoral central venous line, femoral arterial line
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SC
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, bisacodyl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was resuscitated and intubated, but remains comatose with myoclonus. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He takes multiple medications, including anti-arrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, and diuretics.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: He is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and hypercarbia.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a witnessed VF arrest, and the etiology is unclear.
3. Myoclonus: He has persistent myoclonus, which may be a sign of severe hypoxic injury.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a low suspicion of GI bleeding, but it is being monitored.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he requires pressors to support his blood pressure.
6. Fluid status: He is receiving fluids to maintain his blood pressure, but his fluid status is uncertain.
7. Electrolyte abnormalities: He has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
8. Lactic acidosis: He has a lactic acidosis, which may be secondary to hypoxia or shock.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of anti-arrhythmic agents and coronary artery disease increases his risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal white blood cell count increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases his risk of further bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities increase his risk of developing renal failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he develops pneumonia or other complications.
7. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac arrest and history of coronary artery disease increase his risk of developing cardiac failure.

Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and pressors to support blood pressure.
2. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and take measures to prevent further bleeding.
3. Monitor for signs of sepsis and take measures to prevent sepsis.
4. Monitor for signs of renal failure and take measures to prevent renal failure.
5. Consider adding anti-arrhythmic agents to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.
6. Consider antibiotics to prevent pneumonia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and take measures to prevent further electrolyte abnormalities.
8. Consider adding medications to prevent further cardiac complications."
