   Assessment and Plan
   62F with medical history of DM, PVD, ESRD on HD, COPD with altered
   mental status and shortness of breath found to be hypoxic with
   leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia.
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The differential includes hypoxemia, hypocapnia
   or some combination of the two or possibly infection resulting in
   encephalopathy. Possible that developed mucus plug with hypoxemia with
   resolution and significant improvement on BIPAP.
   - goal O2 sat 90-92%
   - ABG if mental status changes
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   .
   #HYPOXIA: Likely that pulmonary infection resulted in V/Q mismatch
   contributing to low SpO2. [**Month (only) 51**] be some element of bronchoconstriction
   contributing with improvement on nebs. Patient with diastolic heart
   failure but appears clinically euvolemic with possibly mild pulmonary
   edema on plain film. ACS considered although no EKG changes. Currently
   patient comfortable w/ O2 sats in low 90s on nasal cannula.
   - continuous O2 monitoring
   - supplemental O2 to goal 90-92%
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Duonebs standing and PRN
   - check BNP
   - trend cardiac enzymes.
   .
   PNEUMONIA: The shortness of breath, cough, elevated white count with
   left shift and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent with
   pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the definition for
   a healthcare acquired infection.  She is immune competant and has a
   CURB-65 score of 2 (confusion, elevated BUN). CT scan shows pneumonia
   but no evidence of cavitation (as appeared on CXR).
   - sputum culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ampicillin
   - supportive treatment of cough
   - Duonebs
   .
   POSITIVE CARDIAC BIOMARKERS: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM
   and PVD presents with SOB, without significant ST changes on EKG and
   elevated cardiac biomarkers. While can expect some elevation of cardiac
   biomarkers in setting of ESRD, this appears to be much higher than
   previously recorded values and troponins continue to trend up. While
   unlikley to be ACS given absence of EKG changes, Elevated troponin may
   be due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, heart failure.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - re-check EKG
   - trend CE
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue beta blocker
   .
   ESRD: Patient with ESRD on hemodialysis on Monday/Wednesday/Friday
   schedule currently being evaluated for renal transplant. Patient with
   electrolytes at baseline.  Last HD [**2163-4-22**] with 3 L of fluid removed.
   - Hemodialysis on M/W/F
   - Consult renal given need for HD in house
   - continue on calcium acetate and calcitriol
   .
   PVD
   - continue aspirin
   - continue plavix
   .
   DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen with ISS
   .
   HYPERTENSION:
   - continue labetalol, amlodipine, lisinopril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, shortness of breath, and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (normal range: 74-102 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 165/54 mmHg (normal range: 103-180/65 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 19-30 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95% (normal range: 90-100%)

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased bilateral breath sounds with bibasilar rales, and her lungs are shallow and labored with effort at deep inspiration. She also has dry, scaling skin, particularly on her lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.1 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.5 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 155 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 5.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.51 ng/mL (normal range: 0.00-0.01 ng/mL)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxia: likely due to pulmonary infection, with possible element of bronchoconstriction
* Pneumonia: diagnosed based on clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging studies
* Positive cardiac biomarkers: elevated troponin-T, likely due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, or heart failure
* ESRD: patient is on hemodialysis, with a need for ongoing treatment and monitoring
* PVD: patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, with ongoing treatment and monitoring
* DM: patient has a history of diabetes, with ongoing treatment and monitoring
* Hypertension: patient has a history of hypertension, with ongoing treatment and monitoring

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: due to hypoxia and pneumonia
* Cardiac complications: due to positive cardiac biomarkers and potential demand ischemia or sepsis
* Renal complications: due to ESRD and ongoing hemodialysis treatment
* Infectious complications: due to pneumonia and potential sepsis
* Cardiovascular complications: due to hypertension and potential cardiac ischemia or failure

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Ongoing antibiotic treatment for pneumonia
* Continuous oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation levels between 90-92%
* Monitoring of cardiac biomarkers and ongoing treatment for potential cardiac complications

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with medical history of DM, PVD, ESRD on HD, COPD with altered
   mental status and shortness of breath found to be hypoxic with
   leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia.
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The differential includes hypoxemia, hypocapnia
   or some combination of the two or possibly infection resulting in
   encephalopathy. Possible that developed mucus plug with hypoxemia with
   resolution and significant improvement on BIPAP.
   - goal O2 sat 90-92%
   - ABG if mental status changes
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   .
   #HYPOXIA: Likely that pulmonary infection resulted in V/Q mismatch
   contributing to low SpO2. [**Month (only) 51**] be some element of bronchoconstriction
   contributing with improvement on nebs. Patient with diastolic heart
   failure but appears clinically euvolemic with possibly mild pulmonary
   edema on plain film. ACS considered although no EKG changes. Currently
   patient comfortable w/ O2 sats in low 90s on nasal cannula.
   - continuous O2 monitoring
   - supplemental O2 to goal 90-92%
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Duonebs standing and PRN
   - BNP not indicative of CHF
   - trend cardiac enzymes.
   .
   PNEUMONIA: The shortness of breath, cough, elevated white count with
   left shift and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent with
   pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the definition for
   a healthcare acquired infection.  She is immune competant and has a
   CURB-65 score of 2 (confusion, elevated BUN). CT scan shows pneumonia
   but no evidence of cavitation (as appeared on CXR).
   - sputum culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ; can discontinue unasyn as no
   cavitary lesion and start vancomycin
   - supportive treatment of cough
   - Duonebs
   .
   POSITIVE CARDIAC BIOMARKERS: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM
   and PVD presents with SOB, without significant ST changes on EKG and
   elevated cardiac biomarkers. While can expect some elevation of cardiac
   biomarkers in setting of ESRD, this appears to be much higher than
   previously recorded values and troponins continue to trend up. While
   unlikley to be ACS given absence of EKG changes, Elevated troponin may
   be due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, heart failure.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - re-check daily EKG
   - trend CE
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt/telemetry
   - re-consult cardiology regarding increasing troponin
   .
   ESRD: Patient with ESRD on hemodialysis on Monday/Wednesday/Friday
   schedule currently being evaluated for renal transplant. Patient with
   electrolytes at baseline.  Last HD [**2163-4-22**] with 3 L of fluid removed.
   - Hemodialysis on M/W/F
   - Consult renal given need for HD in house
   - continue on calcium acetate and calcitriol
   .
   PVD
   - continue aspirin
   - continue plavix
   .
   DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen with ISS
   - patient reports that she takes humalog as her sliding scale.  Will
   clarify today her home regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, shortness of breath, and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxia with oxygen saturation in the low 90s, with a decrease in breath sounds bilaterally and bibasilar rales.
* Cardiovascular: Elevated cardiac biomarkers, including troponin, with a risk of cardiac ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, or heart failure.
* Renal: ESRD on hemodialysis, with a need for renal transplant evaluation.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, possibly due to hypoxemia, hypocapnia, or infection.

The patient has been started on antibiotics for pneumonia, and her antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin. She is also receiving heparin for prophylaxis, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and decreased lung sounds bilaterally put her at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac ischemia or infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and risk factors for cardiac disease increase her risk for cardiac ischemia or infarction.
* Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count put her at risk for sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and need for hemodialysis put her at risk for further renal failure.
* Neurological decline: The patient's altered mental status and risk factors for hypoxemia and hypocapnia increase her risk for neurological decline.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation in the target range.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac biomarkers and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
* Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her hemodialysis schedule as necessary.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old admitted to the ICU with sepsis, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature spiked to 101.2°F, and a trans-thoracic echo was performed. A CT chest scan revealed large pneumonia, but no cavitary lesions. The patient became hypotensive after dialysis, requiring a slow 250cc saline bolus. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are stable, but the patient is still experiencing fever. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level and creatinine suggest potential sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's large pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or pleural effusion.
3. Acute kidney injury progression: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate worsening acute kidney injury, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and elevated troponin level suggest potential cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac tamponade.
5. DVT and VTE: The patient's elevated d-dimer level and prophylactic anticoagulation therapy suggest potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).
6. Nutritional compromise: The patient's nutritional status is unknown, and the patient may be at risk for malnutrition and protein catabolism.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's elevated glucose level may indicate poor glycemic control, which could lead to hyperglycemic complications.
8. Infection control: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple lines and drains increase the risk of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia. Laboratory results show leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia. The patient has a CURB-65 score of 2 and meets the definition for a healthcare-acquired infection.

The patient's condition has been complicated by:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a SpO2 of 95% on room air, which is below the goal of 90-92%. This is likely due to pulmonary infection, which has resulted in V/Q mismatch and bronchoconstriction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a RUL infiltrate on chest film and a CT scan shows pneumonia, but no evidence of cavitation.
3. Positive cardiac biomarkers: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, or heart failure.
4. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis and has electrolyte imbalances.
5. PVD: The patient has a history of PVD and is on aspirin and plavix.
6. DM: The patient has a history of DM and is on home insulin regimen with ISS.
7. Hypertension: The patient is on multiple antihypertensive medications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's positive cardiac biomarkers and history of PVD and DM may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and elevated troponin levels may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and electrolyte imbalances may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's pneumonia and history of PVD may increase the risk of infectious complications such as septicemia or osteomyelitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor SpO2 and adjust oxygen therapy as needed to maintain goal of 90-92%.
3. Continue cardiac enzymes and monitor for signs of cardiac complications.
4. Continue hemodialysis and monitor electrolyte levels.
5. Continue PVD and DM management.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider consultation with renal and cardiology services for further management."
