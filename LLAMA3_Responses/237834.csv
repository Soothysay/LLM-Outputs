You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) and possible upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). She presented with bloody rectal bleeding, hypotension, and a hemoglobin drop. She received 1L of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells in the emergency department with an increase in systolic blood pressure from 85 to 105. The patient is currently receiving transfusions of 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being monitored for further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's hemoglobin drop and ongoing bleeding put her at risk for hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications and organ dysfunction.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension and ongoing bleeding put her at risk for hypovolemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
7. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder and current medications increase the risk of seizure activity, which can lead to altered mental status, muscle weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Infection: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding ulcers and perforation.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's bleeding and transfusion requirements increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation who presents with BRBPR and Hct drop, concerning for lower GIB. The patient has been receiving treatment for GI bleed, including transfusions of 2 units of PRBC, and has been prescribed IV PPI. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 36.6°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 105 bpm, BP 96/47 mmHg, RR 23 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is multifocal atrial tachycardia. 

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 11.7 K/uL, Hct of 31.2%, and Plt of 290 K/uL. The patient's Cr is 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose is 105 mg/dL. 

The patient has a history of S/P fall with R pelvic fracture, and has been hypotensive in the ED. The patient is also at risk for seizure disorder and has a history of constipation. 

The patient is NPO except for meds for colonoscopy and is receiving IVFs for hypotension and to keep MAPs > 60. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is being treated in the ICU until colonoscopy or Hct stabilized. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Lower GI bleeding (LGIB) due to diverticulosis, AVM, or bowel ischemia, which may require further transfusions and treatment.
2. Upper GI bleeding (UGIB) due to a possible tear in the stomach or esophagus, which may require endoscopy and treatment.
3. Hypocalcemia due to citrate in blood products, which may require calcium supplementation.
4. Metabolic alkalosis due to citrate in blood products, which may require treatment with bicarbonate.
5. Hypovolemia due to dehydration, which may require IV fluids and close monitoring of vital signs.
6. Respiratory failure due to multifocal atrial tachycardia, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. Cardiac arrest due to hypotension and unknown cardiac status, which may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
8. Seizure disorder, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
9. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices, which may require antibiotic treatment and close monitoring of vital signs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation who presents with BRBPR and Hct drop, concerning for lower GIB. She has a history of prolapse repair and normal colonoscopy in the past. She received 1L NS and 2U PRBC in the ED with SBP increase from 85 to 105. She has a new systolic murmur and is being considered for a tagged RBC scan. She is also being monitored for tachycardia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's BRBPR and Hct drop suggest a possible GIB, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's new systolic murmur and tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiac conditions, such as MI, atrial fibrillation, or mitral regurgitation, which can lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results suggest possible respiratory compromise, which can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and possible endocarditis risk may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct drop may indicate anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
6. Hypocalcemia and Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's possible massive transfusion may lead to hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
7. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder and possible hypotension may indicate a risk for seizures, which can lead to brain damage, respiratory compromise, or cardiac arrest.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may indicate hypovolemia, which can lead to hypotension, shock, or organ failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke who presents to the ICU with a GI bleed. She has received 2 units of PRBCs and has had bowel preparation overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.6°C, HR of 111 bpm, and BP of 98/47 mmHg. Her SpO2 is 94% and she is receiving respiratory support. The patient's physical examination is limited due to her condition, but her peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems are not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable, but she is still experiencing bleeding, which may lead to further anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 111 bpm, which may be a sign of underlying cardiac issues, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient's CXR may show signs of pneumothorax, which could be a life-threatening complication if not addressed promptly.
4. Hypertension: The patient's BP is 98/47 mmHg, which is relatively low, but her history of hypertension may still be a concern.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder may indicate a risk of seizure activity, which could be exacerbated by her current condition.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a total fluid intake of 3,450 mL and a total fluid output of 812 mL, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 94%, which may indicate respiratory failure, especially given her history of stroke and GI bleed.
8. Infection: The patient's WBC count is 11.7 K/uL, which may indicate an underlying infection that needs to be addressed promptly.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, admitted to the ICU for GI bleed. She received 2 units of PRBCs and had bowel preparation overnight. She is planned for colonoscopy today. Her vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.6°C, HR of 111 bpm, BP of 98/47 mmHg, RR of 26 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 94%. Her physical examination is limited due to her condition. Her lab results show anemia with a HCT of 28.2%, and her ECHO reveals moderate-severe mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is planned for colonoscopy, which may lead to further bleeding.
2. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable, but she may require further transfusions to manage her anemia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECHO reveals moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, which may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's SpO2 is 94%, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
5. Infection: The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, which may indicate infection.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is being treated with Dilantin and Keppra.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
8. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, but she may be at risk for fluid imbalance due to her cardiac condition and bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding closely and adjust her transfusion plan accordingly.
2. Continue to manage her anemia with transfusions as needed.
3. Monitor her cardiac condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Monitor her respiratory status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
5. Monitor her lab results for signs of infection and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Continue to manage her seizure disorder with Dilantin and Keppra.
7. Monitor her nutritional status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Monitor her fluid balance closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   oxygen. If not improved consider chest tube.
   -5L O2
   -consider chest tube
   -serial CXR qday
   #UTI: on levofloxacin, pyridium and Tylenol.
   -d/c pyridium after 3days
   -4 day course of levo
    # GI bleed: BRBPR noted on exam with Hct drop, likely LGIB [**2-22**]
   diverticulosis, AVM, bowel ischemia.  Also consider brisk UGIB as pt
   with report of melena followed by BRBPR.  Patient with history of
   prolapse repair and normal colonoscopy in [**2140**] per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4960**].  She

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation. She presents with BRBPR and Hct drop, concerning for lower GI bleed. She has a known mitral valve murmur and has had a history of mitral valve problem for many years. She has been started on levofloxacin, pyridium, and Tylenol for UTI. She has a new systolic murmur and is being monitored for possible atrial fibrillation or underlying MI. She has hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemia, and her sodium levels are being trended. She has a history of fall with R pelvic fracture and has been seen at multiple hospitals. She has a DNR/DNI status and is being managed for possible GI bleed, UTI, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's BRBPR and Hct drop suggest a possible lower GI bleed, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Upper GI bleed: The patient's history of melena followed by BRBPR suggests a possible upper GI bleed, which could also worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and possible UTI could lead to sepsis if not managed promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's new systolic murmur and tachycardia could indicate underlying cardiac complications, such as MI or atrial fibrillation, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension in the ED and current hypotension could worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's pneumothorax and possible pleural effusion could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to respiratory failure.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and rectal prolapse could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further complications.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's history of fall with R pelvic fracture and possible underlying seizure disorder could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   89 year-old fwmale with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and
   constipation who presents with BRBPR and hct drop concerning for lower
   GIB.
    # GI bleed: BRBPR noted on exam with Hct drop, likely LGIB [**2-22**]
   diverticulosis, AVM, bowel ischemia.  Also consider brisk UGIB as pt
   with report of melena followed by BRBPR.  Patient with history of
   prolapse repair and normal colonoscopy in [**2140**] per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4960**].  She
   recieved 1L ns and 2 U PRBC in the ED with SBP increase from 85 to 105.
   GI recommendations include possible tagged red cell scan given newly
   identified murmur and tachycardia/MAT.
   -tagged RBC scan
   -hold off on colonoscopy
   -trend hct q4h
   -transfuse hct<30
   -IVF for hypotension and to keep MAPs > 60
   -additional large-bore PIV needed
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -Should patient need massive transfusion, will need to monitor PT, PTT,
   INR, platelet counts closely for possible dilution of coagulation
   proteins and replace as needed; also need to monitor for  hypocalcemia
   and metabolic alkalosis [**2-22**] to citrate in blood products.
   .
   #Tachycardia: most likely MAT given pneumothorax s/p line placement
   although also consider atrial fibrillation. Will continue to monitor on
   telemetry
   -repeat EKG/ full rhythm strip
   -continue telemetry
   #Leukocytosis: has been afebrile. monitor serial CBCs
   -f/u pending cultures
   -consider r/o endocarditis with echo
   -trend fevers
   #New systolic murmur: systolic and diastolic component, likely
   partially due to anemia however concern for underlying MI given
   hypotension in the recent past.
   -stat echo
   -cycle enzymes r/o MI
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely [**2-22**] hypovolemia, resolving. IVF as needed
   - trend Na
   # S/P fall with R pelvic fracture: Unclear when this fall was, but
   patient was seen at [**Hospital3 629**] and has been at [**Hospital6 **].
   - Obtain outside recs

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation, who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) and possible upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). She has a recent history of melena followed by bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR). The patient received 1L of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells in the emergency department, which resulted in an increase in systolic blood pressure from 85 to 105 mmHg.

The patient has a number of ongoing medical issues, including:

* Tachycardia, likely due to multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) or atrial fibrillation
* Leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L
* New systolic murmur, which may be due to anemia or underlying myocardial infarction
* Hypotension, which may be related to hypovolemia or sepsis
* Rectal prolapse and constipation
* History of CVA and potential for endocarditis

Potential medical complications:

* Massive transfusion reaction
* Hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis due to citrate in blood products
* Dilution of coagulation proteins and potential bleeding complications
* Development of atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias
* Endocarditis or other infectious complications
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Hypotension or shock
* Respiratory failure or pneumonia
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her gastrointestinal bleed, including IV fluids and packed red blood cells, as well as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. She is also being monitored for potential cardiac arrhythmias and endocarditis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's hematocrit remains stable, and ECHO reveals moderate-severe mitral regurgitation consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The patient has received blood, fluids, and antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure of 104/42 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals normal cardiac and respiratory findings, with soft and non-tender abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Mitral regurgitation/outflow obstruction may lead to further cardiac decompensation, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
	* Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) may cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations.
2. Infections:
	* UTI may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
	* Pneumothorax may lead to respiratory failure or cardiac tamponade if not treated promptly.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizure disorder may lead to seizures, status epilepticus, or even brain damage if not properly managed.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Anemia (GI bleed) may lead to further bleeding, anemia, or even organ failure if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumothorax may lead to respiratory failure or cardiac tamponade if not treated promptly.
6. Hemodynamic Instability:
	* Tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or even cardiac arrest if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   1)       Anemia (GI bleed): hct stable.  No active bleeding. No
   intervention at this time.  GI following
   2)       Pneumothorax: Will place small chest tube for drainage
   3)       Mitral regurgitation/outflow obstruction:  tachycardia
   improved with fluids/blood/low-dose beta blocker. Cardiology consult.
   4)       UTI: Discontinue foley catheter; cipro
   5)       Seizure disorder: dilantin, Keppra

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient has a stable hematocrit, indicating that the anemia is not worsening.
* The patient has a line-related pneumothorax that has not changed with oxygen therapy and will require placement of a small chest tube for drainage.
* The patient has mitral regurgitation and outflow obstruction, which is being managed with fluids, blood, and low-dose beta blocker therapy. A cardiology consult has been ordered.
* The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and will have the foley catheter discontinued and ciprofloxacin discontinued.
* The patient has a seizure disorder and is being treated with dilantin and Keppra.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/42 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 99% and ABG values of 22/22.
* The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 30.5%.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are stable, with potassium, sodium, and chloride levels within normal ranges.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Further worsening of the anemia, potentially leading to increased fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Pneumothorax expanding or becoming more severe, potentially leading to respiratory compromise and cardiac tamponade.
* Mitral regurgitation and outflow obstruction worsening, potentially leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
* UTI spreading to the kidneys, potentially leading to sepsis and acute kidney injury.
* Seizure disorder worsening, potentially leading to increased frequency, severity, and duration of seizures.
* Electrolyte imbalance, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neuromuscular dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management of their anemia, pneumothorax, mitral regurgitation, UTI, seizure disorder, and electrolyte levels."
