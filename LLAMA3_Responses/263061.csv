   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

Summary:

The patient, a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and chronic kidney disease, was admitted to the ICU after being found lethargic at her nursing home. She was hypotensive, hypoxic, and had a Foley catheter in place that drained purulent material. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and troponin levels, suggesting sepsis and possible cardiac injury. The patient was treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid boluses. Her condition improved overnight, and she became more responsive and aware. However, she developed tachycardia and hypertension during a fluid bolus, and her blood pressure remained elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ST depressions on her ECG suggest possible cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease can worsen with the use of nephrotoxic medications and inadequate fluid management, leading to acute kidney injury and further decline in renal function.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and possible pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion can be caused by sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying medical conditions, which can worsen her condition and increase her risk of complications.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor circulation can increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection, tissue necrosis, and other complications.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and chronic kidney disease can increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to provide oxygen therapy as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide ventilatory support as necessary.
6. Provide regular turning and repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and provide sedation as necessary to prevent delirium.
8. Consider ordering a stat echocardiogram to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
9. Consider ordering a stat head CT to further evaluate the patient's mental status and potential for intracranial hypertension.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust therapy accordingly."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into Afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine.
   .
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in PM.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Pressors: Norepi, titrate to MAP >60-65.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus; consider VRE coverage
   if no improvement.
   - Consider cortisol check or [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   .
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in ECG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - VBG for pH.
   .
   FEN: bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with h/o thyroid cancer, COPD, [**Hospital 2443**] nursing home
   resident, found by [**Hospital1 **] staff to be lethargic on morning of [**2113-3-27**]. O2
   sat was 84% on RA. Brought by EMS to [**Hospital1 5**] ED and found to be awake but
   confused but arousable and denied [**Doctor First Name **] pain.  She was hypotensive at
   65/34, and had a Foley placed that drained purulent material.
   Labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 15K, K of 6.3, creatinine of
   3.9, lactate of 1.7, troponin of 0.9.
   UA was positive for WBCs and bacteria.
   ECG showed ST depressions in anterior leads.
   Patient had a LIJ placed in ED and received vanc, levo, and
   ceftriaxone, and 3L NS.
   24 Hour Events:
 NASAL SWAB - At [**2113-3-27**] 09:20 PM mrsa swab
   [**3-27**] to [**3-28**]
   - Arrived in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] and norepinephrine weaned from 0.3 to almost off.
   - Added ciprofloxacin for extra GNR coverage.
   - Repeat K and Cr were improved.
   - Repeat EKG improved from ED.
   - Spoke with son [**Name (NI) 768**] [**Name (NI) 6192**] (HCP): full ICU consent and full code.
   Mother has debilitating psychiatric disease and is not in contact with
   family.  She spent several years in [**Hospital3 3298**] ""sitting in the
   dark, smoking many packs of cigarettes a day"" before moving to nursing
   home two years ago.
   - Pt became progressively more aware and responsive overnight,
   especially with mention of talking to her son (and HCP) [**Name (NI) 768**] (aka
   ""[**Doctor First Name **]"").
   - At approximately 7am pt became tachycardic to 140s with BP 158/98
   while receiving a fluid bolus.

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into Afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine.
   .
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in PM.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Pressors: Norepi, titrate to MAP >60-65.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus; consider VRE coverage
   if no improvement.
   - Consider cortisol check or [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   .
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in ECG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - VBG for pH.
   .
   FEN: bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and acute renal failure (ARF). She was found to be lethargic and hypotensive, with a Foley catheter in place that drained purulent material. The patient was treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid boluses, and was stabilized overnight. However, she became hypotensive again in the morning and went into atrial fibrillation. She is currently on pressors and being monitored closely.

Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to her underlying conditions and the presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating ARF. This is likely due to prerenal failure caused by volume depletion and poor flow, rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or postobstructive nephropathy.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, likely due to ARF, K supplementation, and the use of certain medications.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's pH levels are slightly acidic, likely due to renal failure.
5. ECG Changes: The patient's ECG shows ST depressions, likely due to hypertrophy or IVCD.
6. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy is likely due to systemic illness, rather than a focal CNS process.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to her underlying respiratory conditions and the use of a ventilator.
2. Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI): The patient is at risk of developing CAUTI due to the presence of a Foley catheter.
3. Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI): The patient is at risk of developing CLABSI due to the presence of a central line.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrest due to her underlying cardiac conditions and the use of vasopressors.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's ARF may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed properly.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying conditions and the presence of a UTI.

Management Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics to cover urinary organisms.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust medication doses as necessary.
3. Continue to trend the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication doses as necessary.
4. Consider imaging studies to evaluate the patient's abdominal and urinary tracts.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust medication doses as necessary.
6. Consider the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory function.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medication doses as necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was found to be lethargic and hypotensive on admission to the ICU. She has a Foley catheter in place and has been treated with antibiotics for a presumed urinary tract infection (UTI). Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She is currently being treated with pressors and fluids to manage her septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. UTI: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a UTI, which is a common complication in patients with dementia and urinary incontinence.
2. AKI: The patient's AKI is likely due to prerenal causes, such as volume depletion and poor flow, as well as potential renal ischemia.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to the UTI, and she requires aggressive management with fluids, pressors, and antibiotics.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her current hypotension and tachycardia increase her risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's AKI and septic shock increase her risk for renal failure, which can lead to further complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and septic shock increase her risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications.
7. Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and AKI increase her risk for sepsis-related organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for the UTI and monitor for improvement.
2. Monitor the patient's AKI and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue pressors and fluids to manage septic shock.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider imaging studies to evaluate the patient's kidneys and urinary tract.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider consultation with a nephrologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's AKI and septic shock."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in today.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in EKG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Aline today for pH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in today.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in EKG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Aline today for pH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and acute kidney injury (AKI).
* She was found to be lethargic and hypotensive on admission, with a blood pressure of 65/34 mmHg.
* Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and troponin, indicating possible sepsis and cardiac injury.
* Urine analysis revealed cloudy urine with many WBCs and bacteria, suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the likely source of sepsis.
* The patient's cardiac enzymes were negative, and there was no evidence of pneumonia.
* She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime and ciprofloxacin, and vanc for enterococcus.
* The patient's AKI was likely due to prerenal failure, with a baseline creatinine not clear.
* She was also found to have hyperkalemia, which was managed with insulin and D50.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury and worsening hyperkalemia
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure
* Respiratory failure due to COPD
* Sepsis-induced encephalopathy and worsening cognitive function
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for UTI and sepsis
* Management of AKI, including fluid resuscitation and renal replacement therapy if necessary
* Correction of hyperkalemia with insulin and D50
* Supportive care for septic shock, including vasopressors and fluid management
* Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and arrhythmias
* Nutritional support and glycemic control
* Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to guide further management."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Now back on pressors.  Likely urinary tract source.
   Preliminary culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus (latter
   likely contaminant).   Continue current broad spectrum antibiotics. WBC
   decreasing, lactate trending down.  Still hemodynamically unstable
   albeit afib likely contributing.  Enzymes trending down, no evident
   acute cardiac component.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Likely contributing to earlier drop in blood
   pressure.  Now in sinus rhythm, autoconverted following fluid bolus.
   Check echo.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More awake and alert this am.
 ANEMIA:  Hct drop likely dilutional given aggressive volume
   resusitation overnight.  Need to follow serial CBCs.  Guaiac stools.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE):  Likely component of prerenal vs. ATN in setting of
   sepsis and hypotension.  She does have persistent eos in UA, may have
   component of interstitial nephritis.  Will review med list and stop any
   that may be potentially contributing.  Cr trending down, now 2.2.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Now back on pressors.  Likely urinary tract source.
   Preliminary culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus (latter
   likely contaminant).   Continue current broad spectrum antibiotics. WBC
   decreasing, lactate trending down.  Still hemodynamically unstable
   albeit afib likely contributing.  Enzymes trending down, no evident
   acute cardiac component.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Likely contributing to earlier drop in blood
   pressure.  Now in sinus rhythm, autoconverted following fluid bolus.
   Check echo.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More awake and alert this am.
 ANEMIA:  Hct drop likely dilutional given aggressive volume
   resusitation overnight.  Need to follow serial CBCs.  Guaiac stools.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE):  Likely component of prerenal vs. ATN in setting of
   sepsis and hypotension.  She does have persistent eos in UA, may have
   component of interstitial nephritis.  Will review med list and stop any
   that may be potentially contributing.  Cr trending down, now 2.2.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with urosepsis, currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable, with a drop in blood pressure to the 70s, requiring a 1L NS bolus and restarting of pressors. The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which may be contributing to the hypotension.

The patient has a history of dementia and is unable to provide a medical history. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 138 bpm
* Blood pressure: 73/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

* Platelet count: 294 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

* Septic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Chronic kidney disease
* Atrial fibrillation
* Anemia
* Renal failure
* Urinary tract infection
* Dementia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Monitoring for signs of septic shock and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for acute kidney injury and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for atrial fibrillation and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for anemia and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for renal failure and adjusting therapy as necessary

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Imaging: Echo from [**8-25**]
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off
   pressors. Echo showed no strep viridans vegs.
   - follow blood cultures
   - ID consult today because strep viridans is an unusual UTI bug.
   - discontinue ciprofloxacin and vanc.  Continue ceftriaxone.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - discontinue a line today
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - only need daily lytes to trend BUN and CR, since we are not using
   diuresis.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   - restart home nefedipine given good blood pressure.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - can restart depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, trazodone.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend with afternoon HCT
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD and is wheezing on exam
   - restart home tiotropium (spiriva) and ipratropium/albuterol
   (combivent)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off
   pressors. Echo showed no strep viridans vegs.
   - follow blood cultures
   - ID consult today because strep viridans is an unusual UTI bug.
   - discontinue ciprofloxacin and vanc.  Continue ceftriaxone.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - discontinue a line today
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - only need daily lytes to trend BUN and CR, since we are not using
   diuresis.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   - restart home nefedipine given good blood pressure.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - can restart depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, trazodone.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend with afternoon HCT
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD and is wheezing on exam
   - restart home tiotropium (spiriva) and ipratropium/albuterol
   (combivent)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital with lethargy and hypoxia and was found to have leukocytosis and a positive urine culture, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 37.2°C, HR = 103 bpm, BP = 85/63 mmHg, RR = 18 breaths/min, SpO2 = 96%
* Laboratory results: WBC = 8.3 K/uL, HCT = 25.3%, Cr = 1.5 mg/dL, BUN = 23 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: Echo shows mild left atrial dilation, normal left ventricular function, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* Microbiology: Urine culture grew Streptococcus viridans, a rare UTI pathogen
* Medical conditions: Septic shock, acute kidney injury (ARF) on chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and anemia

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. ARF progression: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to increased creatinine levels, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. AFib-related complications: The patient's AFib may lead to stroke, embolism, or heart failure.
4. Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, pneumonia, or cardiac complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for the UTI
* Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for septic shock
* Management of ARF with daily electrolyte monitoring and diuresis as needed
* Rate control and rhythm management for AFib
* Anemia management with transfusions as needed
* COPD management with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy as needed

The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor once his condition stabilizes."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was admitted to the hospital with lethargy and hypoxia and was found to have leukocytosis and a positive urine culture.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C, heart rate is 103 bpm, blood pressure is 85/63 mmHg, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, platelet count is 272 K/uL, and creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L.
* Imaging studies: The patient's echocardiogram shows a mildly dilated left atrium and normal left ventricular function.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Septic shock: The patient's blood culture is pending, but the urine culture has grown Streptococcus viridans, which could lead to septic shock if not treated promptly.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, which increases the risk of acute kidney injury.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but the patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Administer antibiotics to treat the patient's urinary tract infection.
* Consider initiating dialysis if the patient's creatinine level continues to rise.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
* Consider consulting with a cardiologist to assess the patient's cardiovascular status and provide guidance on management.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide supportive care as needed."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2113-3-28**] 02:45 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia and leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improving mental status and off pressors. His blood pressure is stable, with a systolic pressure in the 80s and a diastolic pressure in the 60s. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg. His respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen therapy, with a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) of 8.3 K/uL, with a decreasing trend
* Hematocrit (Hct) of 25.3%, with a decreasing trend
* Platelet count (Plt) of 272, with a decreasing trend
* Creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, with a decreasing trend
* Troponin-T of 0.06 ng/mL, with a normal range
* Lactic acid of 0.7 mmol/L, with a normal range
* Calcium of 7.6 mg/dL, with a normal range
* Magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, with a normal range
* Phosphorus of 2.4 mg/dL, with a normal range

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with mild dilation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and normal regional and global systolic function
* No ventricular septal defect, right ventricular chamber size, or free wall motion abnormalities

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Blood culture pending, with a possible source of streptococcus viridans
* Urine culture final, with a positive result for streptococcus viridans

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Impaired skin integrity
* Tachycardia
* Septic shock
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
* Chronic renal failure (CRF)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for streptococcus viridans
* Norepinephrine for hypotension
* Heparin for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Glycemic control
* Nutrition support
* ICU care, including multi-lumen lines, arterial line, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers
* Infection and sepsis secondary to the patient's chronic medical conditions."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Imaging: Echo from [**8-25**]
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Other items on differential are less likely: cardiac enzymes
   and echo negative, no physical or imaging evidence of pneumonia, no
   recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off pressors.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - continue to hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared),
   wellbutrin, trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2113-3-28**] 02:45 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Other items on differential are less likely: cardiac enzymes
   and echo negative, no physical or imaging evidence of pneumonia, no
   recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off pressors.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - continue to hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared),
   wellbutrin, trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital in a lethargic state with hypoxia and was found to have leukocytosis and a positive urine culture.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.2°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 103 bpm, BP 85/63 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 7 mmHg, MAP 65 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen at 2 liters per minute.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 8.3 K/uL, Hct 25.3%, Platelet count 272 K/uL.
	+ Blood chemistry: Sodium 144 mEq/L, Potassium 3.1 mEq/L, Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL.
	+ Urine culture: Strep viridans.
	+ Electrolyte panel: Calcium 7.6 mg/dL, Magnesium 1.8 mg/dL, Phosphorus 2.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions are as follows:

* Septic shock: Presumed due to urinary tract infection (UTI) with Strep viridans.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): Stage 1 AKI with BUN 23 mg/dL and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL.
* Atrial fibrillation (AFib): Patient had episodes of AFib on admission, but is currently in sinus rhythm.
* Lethargy and altered mental status: Likely due to systemic illness.
* Anemia: Patient's hematocrit is decreasing since admission.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin to cover urinary organisms, and vancomycin to cover enterococcus.
* Fluid management: Monitor CVP and maintain MAPs above 65 mmHg with fluid and phenylephrine.
* Rate control: Consider metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
* Sedation: Hold depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, and trazodone until further evaluation.
* Nutrition: Advance diet if stool softeners pass.
* Glycemic control: Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust medication as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued septic shock and AKI
* Progression of AKI to stage 2 or 3
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to central venous catheter or other invasive devices
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Increased risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and urosepsis. She has a history of chronic renal failure and has been experiencing fatigue, altered mental status, and anemia. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/82 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula. She has been receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, and her blood cultures have not grown any bacteria to date.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis could progress to sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure could worsen due to her sepsis and hypotension, leading to acute kidney injury and potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen due to her chronic kidney disease and blood loss, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease could lead to heart failure, which could worsen her symptoms and increase her risk of mortality.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's chronic kidney disease and immobility could increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation could increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
7. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection: The patient's central lines could increase her risk of developing a catheter-related bloodstream infection, which could lead to sepsis and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids and antibiotics to treat the patient's urosepsis and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate closely to ensure that her hypotension does not worsen.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a floor bed once her condition stabilizes.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if her kidney function worsens.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist to help manage the patient's chronic kidney disease.
6. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and consider increasing her oxygen flow rate if her saturation drops.
7. Consider consulting an infectious disease specialist to help manage the patient's sepsis and urosepsis."
