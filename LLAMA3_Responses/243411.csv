   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis.  The patient
s WBC count
   more elevated today at 19, mildly hypothermic, tachycardia masked by
   beta blockade.  Most likely source is urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA).
   Other possibilities include ulcers (previously grew MRSA), HD line, or
   endovascular. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based on symptoms
   although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue broad spectrum antiobiotics with dapto, zosyn and flagyl
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx and stool C. Diff
   - Attempt to send cultures from HD line, discuss with renal
   - Renal U/S to r/o abscess
   - Wound care consult, consider X-rays to rule out osteomyelitis, ESR no
   utility in chronic inflammatory states
   - Vascular surgery to evaluate heel ulcer today
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   .
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Notify renal of pt admission, may require CVVHD today, will discuss
   with renal today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   .
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   .
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   .
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and diverticulitis with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension likely secondary to sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 19.1 K/uL. The patient has a history of urosepsis, MRSA, and VRE infections, and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a stage 4 decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines, and is at risk for further skin breakdown. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 89/30 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Skin Breakdown: The patient's stage 4 decubitus ulcer is at high risk for further breakdown, which can lead to infection and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may not be fully controlled, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. End-stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD may exacerbate her hypotension and increase her risk of sepsis and organ failure.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD may worsen her hypotension and increase her risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
6. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's CHF may worsen her hypotension and increase her risk of cardiac arrest and death.
7. Diverticulitis: The patient's diverticulitis may worsen her LGIB and increase her risk of bleeding and sepsis.
8. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA and VRE infections increases her risk of developing a new infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the patient's sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's skin integrity closely and consider wound care consult to prevent further breakdown.
3. Continue to wean the patient off pressors and consider vasopressin therapy to improve her blood pressure.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider adjusting her cardiac medications to improve her blood pressure and reduce her risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Consider performing a renal ultrasound to rule out abscess or other complications related to her ESRD.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust her insulin regimen as needed to prevent hyperglycemia.
7. Consider performing a stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her electrolyte supplements as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension - Likely sepsis, although hypovolemia likely contributing
   as completed HD today. Patient with a WBC >12,000, does not strictly
   meet SIRS but tachycardia may be masked by beta-blocker; urine is the
   likely source (recent VRE and MSSA). Other possibilities include ulcers
   (previously grew MRSA), HD line, or endovascular. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on
   CXR. Pt currently has a central line with vasopressor support. Will
   continue fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for a SBP >90.
   Pt's BP currently noted to be SBP 110s after 2L NS in the ED, on
   Levophed at 0.09.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue broad spectrum antiobiotics with dapto, zosyn and flagyl
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx and stool C. Diff
   - Attempt to send cultures from HD line, discuss with renal
   - Renal U/S to r/o abscess
   - Wound care consult
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   .
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Notify renal of pt admission, may require CVVHD today, will discuss
   with renal today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   .
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   .
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   .
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria. Active T&S. Hct daily.
   .
   # DM: Will cotninue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   .
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notify her vascular surgeon

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history, including ESRD, CAD, CHF, LGIB, and DM. They are currently receiving vasopressor support for hypotension, which is likely secondary to sepsis and hypovolemia. The patient has a central line, PIV, and tunneled HD line, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. They have a history of VRE and MSSA, and their urine is the likely source of the infection.

The patient's lab results show evidence of sepsis, with a WBC count of 19.1 K/uL and a CRP of 29.0%. Their renal function is compromised, with a creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL and a BUN of 21 mg/dL. They have a history of ischemic heart disease and are currently on statin therapy, but their beta-blocker is being held due to hypotension.

The patient's physical examination is significant for tachycardia, hypotension, and bilateral crackles in the lungs. They have a soft, non-tender abdomen, and their extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and they have a history of VRE and MSSA, which increases their risk of developing sepsis.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and they have a history of ESRD, which increases their risk of developing acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, and their beta-blocker is being held due to hypotension, which increases their risk of developing cardiac complications.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of LGIB, and their urine is the likely source of the infection, which increases their risk of developing gastrointestinal complications.
5. Ischemic Complications: The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, and their WBC count is elevated, which increases their risk of developing ischemic complications.
6. Skin Complications: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases their risk of developing skin complications, such as decubitus ulcers.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient has bilateral crackles in the lungs, which increases their risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of depression, and their WBC count is elevated, which increases their risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for their hypotension. They should also continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics for their suspected sepsis, and their wound care should be closely monitored to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension - Likely sepsis, although hypovolemia likely contributing
   as completed HD today. Patient with a WBC >12,000, does not strictly
   meet SIRS but tachycardia may be masked by beta-blocker; urine is the
   likely source (recent VRE and MSSA). Other possibilities include ulcers
   (previously grew MRSA), HD line, or endovascular. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on
   CXR. Pt currently has a central line with vasopressor support. Will
   continue fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for a SBP >90.
   Pt's BP currently noted to be SBP 110s after 2L NS in the ED, on
   Levophed at 0.09. Will down-titrate Levophed and will hold pt's current
   hypertensive regimen until resolved.
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain SBP>90
   - Continue broad spectrum antiobiotics with dapto and zosyn
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx and stool C. Diff
   - Attempt to send cultures from HD line, discuss with renal
   - Renal U/S to r/o abscess
   - Wound care consult
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   .
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Notify renal of pt admission, may require CVVHD should continue to
   need vasopressors
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   .
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   .
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   .
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria. Active T&S. Hct daily.
   .
   # DM: Will cotninue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   .
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notify her vascular surgeon

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension (SBP 89-110 mmHg) requiring vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation
* Impaired skin integrity with a history of decubitus ulcer and currently with a tunneled HD line
* Renal impairment with ESRD requiring HD three times a week
* History of CAD with NSTEMI, CHF, and LGIB
* DM requiring insulin and lantus
* Depression requiring medication
* FEN with low Na, cardiac, and diabetic diet
* Multiple lines and access devices

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state and history of VRE and MSSA
* Endovascular infection or sepsis related to the HD line
* Pulmonary source of sepsis despite low suspicion
* Ulceration or infection of the skin or soft tissue
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to inadequate perfusion or sepsis
* Cardiovascular instability or cardiac arrest due to hypotension or sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to LGIB
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to DM
* Depression or anxiety exacerbation due to medical instability
* Wound care complications or infection due to decubitus ulcer

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continued fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain SBP >90 mmHg
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage for VRE and MSSA
* Follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
* Renal US to rule out abscess
* Wound care consult
* Trend WBC count and fever curve
* Continue phos binders and renally dose medications
* Notify renal of admission and potential need for CVVHD
* Continue medical management for CAD, CHF, and LGIB

Close monitoring of the patient's condition is essential to prevent and manage potential complications, and to ensure optimal treatment and outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multi-lumen catheter placement, ongoing pressor support, and treatment for suspected Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Daptomycin, and Metronidazole. Notable vital signs include hypotension (BP 89/30 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 70 bpm). The patient's respiratory status is stable, with SpO2 of 99% on nasal cannula oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, and the patient is receiving a 500cc bolus of fluid at midnight to attempt to wean pressors.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hct 29.0%), mild thrombocytopenia (Plt 177 K/uL), and elevated creatinine (Cr 2.6 mg/dL). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hypokalemia (K 2.6 mg/dL). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 19.1 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 89/30 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may be related to sepsis, vasopressor withdrawal, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of hypotension and adjust therapy accordingly.
2. C. diff infection: The patient is receiving treatment for suspected C. diff infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, or fever, is crucial. The patient's stool culture results will help guide further treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 177 K/uL, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as petechiae, ecchymosis, or gastrointestinal bleeding, is essential.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.6 mg/dL, indicating mild renal insufficiency. Monitoring for signs of worsening renal function, such as oliguria or increased creatinine, is necessary.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is low at 2.6 mg/dL, which may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness. Monitoring for signs of electrolyte imbalance and adjusting therapy accordingly is essential.
6. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated at 19.1 K/uL, which may indicate infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased WBC count, is necessary.
7. Vasopressor dependence: The patient is receiving norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. Weaning vasopressors may be challenging, and close monitoring of blood pressure and other vital signs is necessary to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of ESRD on HD, systolic CHF, PVD with L BKA, CAD with NSTEMI, DM II, prior LGIB, and stage IV decubitus ulcer. She presented to the hospital with hot on off (HOTN) after HD and was found to have septic shock, likely caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was not treated specifically. She also has a history of VRE UTI and CHF.

The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and zosyn, and was switched to daptozyn and flagyl for possible C. diff. She was also given IV fluids and vasopressors to support her blood pressure.

The patient's condition has worsened, with increasing oxygen requirements and worsening chest X-ray findings, indicating increased b/l edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient's multi-lumen catheter and 18-gauge catheter increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Decubitus ulcer progression: The patient's stage IV decubitus ulcer can worsen, leading to further tissue damage and potential sepsis.
5. C. diff colitis: The patient's treatment with flagyl for possible C. diff colitis increases the risk of C. diff colitis.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's DM II and treatment with insulin and other medications increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's CHF and septic shock can lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and tachycardia.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status increases the risk of respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
9. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and septic shock can lead to further renal failure, requiring dialysis.
10. Increased risk of mortality: The patient's critical illness and multiple comorbidities increase her risk of mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, systolic congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus type II, and prior lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She presented to the emergency department with hypotension and septic shock after hemodialysis. She was treated with antibiotics and vasopressors, but her condition worsened, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/37 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* No acute distress
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Right decubitus ulcer (stage IV)
* Sacral decubitus ulcer (stage IV)
* Warm skin
* Neurologic examination: follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time and place, but movement and tone are not assessed

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 19.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.0%
* Platelet count: 177 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21 mg/dL
* Glucose: 142 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.4/33.3/1.5, Ca++: 7.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

Imaging results:

* Chest X-ray: increased bilateral edema

Assessment and Plan:

* Septic shock likely caused by UTI (VRE), HD line, decubitus ulcers, or C. diff
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and follow up on cultures
* Worsening CXR suggests that the patient is not hypovolemic, so IV fluids will be discontinued
* HOTN likely caused by septicemia, acute on chronic systolic CHF, and DM II
* Try to place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PIC) line
* ICU care: nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Hypovolemic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Worsening of chronic systolic CHF
* Hyperglycemia
* Infection (UTI, VRE, C. diff)
* Decubitus ulcer progression
* C. diff colitis
* Cardiovascular complications (arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock)
* Respiratory complications (pneumonia, respiratory failure)
* Neurologic complications (seizures, cerebral edema)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and a history of NSTEMI. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension likely secondary to sepsis, and was found to have C. difficile infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 35.8°C, HR 69 bpm, BP 87/39 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 97%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 regular without murmur
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right femoral central venous line, left below-knee amputation
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands
* Laboratory results: WBC 19.1, Hct 29.0, Cr 2.6, Glucose 142 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and she may require continued support with vasopressors.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's mental status improved with decreased oxygenation, but she still has mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a positive C. difficile toxin test and is being treated with IV and PO vancomycin.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and is at risk for further kidney damage.
5. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for further complications.
6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a significant stage 4 decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines, which requires wound care and potential surgical intervention.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with remeron and celexa.
8. FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional) imbalance: The patient has a low sodium level and may require repletion.
9. Access issues: The patient has multiple central venous lines and may require further intervention to maintain access.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for C. difficile infection.
2. Wean Levophed and hold hypertensive regimen until resolved.
3. Follow up blood, urine cultures, and check sputum CXR.
4. Trend WBC count and fever curve.
5. Maintain Hct > 25 and transfuse if necessary.
6. Continue phos binders and renally dose medications.
7. Renal consult.
8. Continue medical management of CAD, CHF, and DM.
9. Wound care consult for decubitus ulcer.
10. Continue depression treatment.
11. Monitor for FEN imbalance and access issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. The patient has been experiencing hemodynamic instability, with blood pressures ranging from 55 to 137 mmHg, and has required vasopressor support with norepinephrine. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, and they have a small bilateral kidney with cortical thinning consistent with chronic kidney disease.

The patient has a positive C. difficile toxin test, which is likely contributing to their gastrointestinal symptoms. They have a history of antibiotic use, including piperacillin-tazobactam, daptomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a heart rate of 69 beats per minute. However, they have experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which may be a concern.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% on nasal cannula oxygen. However, they have a history of respiratory failure, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.26, which may indicate metabolic acidosis.

The patient's neurologic status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, indicating a severe alteration in mental status. They are not responding to verbal stimuli, and their movement and tone are not assessed.

The patient has a history of bleeding, with a platelet count of 177 and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive C. difficile toxin test and history of antibiotic use may increase their risk of developing sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function and history of chronic kidney disease may increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and use of vasopressors may increase their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and use of oxygen therapy may increase their risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and use of anticoagulants may increase their risk of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's positive C. difficile toxin test and history of antibiotic use may increase their risk of developing infections.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of gastrointestinal symptoms and use of antibiotics may increase their risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.
8. Worsening of underlying medical conditions: The patient's complex medical history and use of multiple medications may increase their risk of developing worsening of underlying medical conditions.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their hemodynamic, renal, cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic status. They should also receive targeted therapy for their C. difficile infection and antibiotic-associated diarrhea."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and a history of cardiovascular disease, including a recent NSTEMI. She was admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been experiencing symptoms of back and bottom pain, and has a history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been placed on a low-sodium diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the C. diff infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Kidney Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the C. diff infection and other underlying medical conditions.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including a recent NSTEMI, and is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of recurrent LGIB and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction due to the C. diff infection and other underlying medical conditions.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and is at risk of developing further skin breakdown and infection.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to the C. diff infection and other underlying medical conditions.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of depression and is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to the C. diff infection and other underlying medical conditions.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for signs of sepsis, kidney failure, cardiovascular complications, gastrointestinal complications, decubitus ulcer, respiratory complications, and neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with septic shock due to C. diff septicemia. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure, sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation. She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still experiencing hypoxemia and hypercarbia. She has a urinary catheter and a femoral line, which needs to be discontinued. She is also scheduled for hemodialysis today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and sleep apnea may worsen due to her septic shock and fluid overload, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has C. diff septicemia, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid overload and hypovolemic shock may worsen due to her septic shock, leading to further complications.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's ESRD may worsen due to her septic shock, leading to kidney injury and further complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may worsen due to her septic shock, leading to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to neurological complications such as encephalopathy, seizures, and stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's C. diff septicemia may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as colitis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
8. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's septic shock may lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, which can result in cardiac failure and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Pending HD today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: R femoral CVL, PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Pending HD today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: R femoral CVL, PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD, CAD, CHF, LGIB, and DM. She was admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and was found with decreased alertness and hypercapnia. Her condition has improved, but not resolved. She has a stage IV decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to her ongoing infections and compromised immune system.
2. Decubitus Ulcer Progression: The stage IV decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines is a significant risk factor for further complications, including infection, osteomyelitis, and amputation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to continue, and she may require further interventions to stabilize her blood pressure.
4. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypercarbia may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
5. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is likely to continue, and she will require ongoing dialysis therapy.
6. CAD: The patient's CAD is a significant risk factor for further cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and heart failure.
7. LGIB: The patient's LGIB is a significant risk factor for further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and perforation.
8. DM: The patient's DM is a significant risk factor for further complications, including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
9. Depression: The patient's depression is a significant risk factor for further complications, including decreased appetite, weight loss, and increased risk of infections.
10. Pain Control: The patient's acute and chronic pain needs to be managed effectively to prevent further complications, including decreased mobility and increased risk of falls."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a stage IV osteomyelitis (bone infection) who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's condition has been stable, with vital signs within normal ranges. However, there are concerns regarding potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bone infection and the presence of multiple antibiotics in their system increase the risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to an infection.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's decreased blood pressure, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal blood gas values indicate potential organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and cardiovascular system.
3. Infection Progression: The patient's ongoing bone infection and the presence of multiple antibiotics in their system increase the risk of infection progression and the development of secondary infections.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
5. Wound Complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity and the presence of a wound increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and delayed healing.
6. Pain Management: The patient's acute and chronic pain require effective management to prevent pain-related complications and improve their quality of life.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's altered nutritional status and the need for enteral nutrition increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.
8. Glycemic Control: The patient's altered glucose metabolism and the need for insulin therapy increase the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can have significant consequences if not managed properly.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   -Check arterial line to ensure pressor requirement is accurate
   - If persistently hypotensive, will reinitiate Dapto/Zosyn
   -Check lactate and mixed venous O2 today
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - HD pending pressor requirement, will discuss need for HD with renal,
   as patient may be intravascularly dry but total volume up.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Currently DNR/DNI- will likely progress to no escalation of
   care pending family talk today
   # Dispo:  ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   -Check arterial line to ensure pressor requirement is accurate
   - If persistently hypotensive, will reinitiate Dapto/Zosyn
   -Check lactate and mixed venous O2 today
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - HD pending pressor requirement, will discuss need for HD with renal,
   as patient may be intravascularly dry but total volume up.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Currently DNR/DNI- will likely progress to no escalation of
   care pending family talk today

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, admitted for hypotension and sepsis. She has a known C. difficile infection and is experiencing decreased alertness and hypercapnia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F) and a heart rate of 81 beats per minute. She has a Stage IV decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.1, a hemoglobin level of 29.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 228 K/μL. Her creatinine level is 2.6 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: Secondary to sepsis, likely C. difficile. Attempt to wean Levophed, continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin, and follow-up blood and urine cultures.
* Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Tolerate hypercarbia if patient is comfortable and mentating, follow ABG with status changes, and clarify code status/intubation status.
* End-stage renal disease: Continue HD pending pressor requirement, discuss need for HD with renal, and continue phosphorus binders.
* Coronary artery disease: Continue medical management with statin, hold beta-blocker for now due to hypotension, and continue to hold ASA due to recent recurrent LGIB.
* Chronic heart failure: Holding beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves, low Na diet, daily weights, and I/Os.
* Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: Unknown source, but CT abd shows significant diverticuli, and Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per above criteria.
* Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's hypercarbia may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to respiratory failure.
* End-stage renal disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular complications.
* Chronic heart failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to pulmonary edema and other complications.
* Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's lower gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to anemia and other complications.
* Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to infection and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with septicemia due to C. diff and Stage IV decubitus ulcer requiring debridement. She is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulants. She has a history of renal failure, coagulopathy, and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and dialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septicemia may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration may require dialysis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to increased risk of infection, sepsis, and mortality.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to cardiac compromise and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure and mortality.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may deteriorate, leading to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and mortality.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate, leading to increased risk of neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment and seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulants as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider vitamin K administration if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer and consider debridement if necessary.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status closely and consider adjusting treatment accordingly.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider adjusting treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman admitted with septicemia due to C. diff and Stage IV decubitus ulcer requiring debridement. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, renal failure, and coagulopathy. She is currently on levophed, and her blood pressure is being monitored. She is also receiving antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a nasogastric tube and a urinary catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and renal failure increase her risk of developing sepsis-related organ dysfunction, which can lead to acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Decubitus ulcer progression: The patient's Stage IV decubitus ulcer is at risk of progressing to deeper stages, which can lead to increased risk of infection, sepsis, and poor wound healing.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure increases her risk of developing acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's septic shock and hypotension increase her risk of developing cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and poor outcomes.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but her risk of developing respiratory failure is increased due to her septic shock and renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's septicemia and decubitus ulcer increase her risk of developing new infections, particularly in the setting of invasive devices or procedures.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and septic shock increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
9. Neurological compromise: The patient's septic shock and coagulopathy increase her risk of developing neurological compromise, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypoperfusion."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia which have improved (but not
   resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - Consider adding back Dapto/Zosyn today as persistently hypotensive
   and continues to require pressors
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.  Likely
   secondary to chronic
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and is found to have decreased alertness and hypercapnia. The patient has a history of multiple medical problems, including C. difficile, urosepsis, posterior ulcer, and endovascular source.

The patient's current conditions include:

* Hypotension: secondary to sepsis, likely C. difficile, with a trending WBC count and hypothermia.
* Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to chronic lung disease.
* ESRD: with worsening renal function, requiring hemodialysis (HD) today.
* CAD: with a history of NSTEMI, no current signs of ischemia, and on medical management with a statin, holding beta-blocker due to hypotension.
* CHF: with systolic dysfunction, holding beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves.
* LGIB: with an unknown source, unable to tolerate colonoscopy, and on a low-sodium diet.
* DM: on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
* Decubitus Ulcer: with a wound care consult and recommended accuzyme treatment.
* Depression: on remeron and celexa.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: with a trending WBC count and hypothermia, the patient is at risk for further sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, the patient may require mechanical ventilation.
* Renal failure: with worsening renal function, the patient may require more frequent or prolonged hemodialysis.
* Cardiovascular complications: with a history of CAD and CHF, the patient is at risk for further cardiac complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: with an unknown source of LGIB, the patient is at risk for further bleeding.
* Decubitus ulcer progression: with a stage 4 decubitus ulcer on the sacrum and bilateral ischial spines, the patient is at risk for further ulcer progression.
* Infection: with a history of C. difficile and urosepsis, the patient is at risk for further infection.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin, follow-up blood and urine cultures, and trend WBC count and fever curve. The patient will also require continued medical management for CAD, CHF, LGIB, and DM, as well as wound care for the decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   -Check arterial line to ensure pressor requirement is accurate
   - If persistently hypotensive, will reinitiate Dapto/Zosyn
   -Check lactate and mixed venous O2 today
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - HD pending pressor requirement, will discuss need for HD with renal,
   as patient may be intravascularly dry but total volume up.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   -Check arterial line to ensure pressor requirement is accurate
   - If persistently hypotensive, will reinitiate Dapto/Zosyn
   -Check lactate and mixed venous O2 today
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - HD pending pressor requirement, will discuss need for HD with renal,
   as patient may be intravascularly dry but total volume up.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Currently DNR/DNI- will likely progress to no escalation of
   care pending family talk today

   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive regimen until
   resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin, add back zosyn and daptomycin as
   the patient continues to be hypotensive with a pressor requirement.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   -          HD vs CVVH today for volume removal and acidosis treatment
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors thus may need CVVH
   - Will give 150mEq of Bicarb for acidosis treatment
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive regimen until
   resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin, add back zosyn and daptomycin as
   the patient continues to be hypotensive with a pressor requirement.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   -          HD vs CVVH today for volume removal and acidosis treatment
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors thus may need CVVH
   - Will give 150mEq of Bicarb for acidosis treatment
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K yesterday
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].  Vascular recommended accuzyme to the

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including sepsis, C. Diff, hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory distress, ESRD, CAD, CHF, LGIB, and DM. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hypotension, decreased alertness, and hypercapnia. She has a history of NSTEMI and has had recent VRE and MSSA infections. She is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and zosyn, and has been prescribed medications for pain control, depression, and hypotension. She has a tunneled HD line and is receiving dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely secondary to C. Diff, but other sources, such as urosepsis, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source, cannot be ruled out. The patient's WBC count is trending back up, and she is still hypotensive, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis is a significant concern, and she may require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to manage her respiratory distress.
3. ESRD: The patient's renal function is worsening, and she may require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) to manage her acidosis and volume overload.
4. CAD: The patient's history of NSTEMI and recent recurrent LGIB increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, MI, or cardiac arrest.
5. CHF: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen due to her hypotension, and she may require increased diuretic therapy or other cardiac medications to manage her symptoms.
6. LGIB: The patient's unknown source of bleeding may continue to cause hemodynamic instability and increase her risk of bleeding complications.
7. DM: The patient's DM may worsen due to her hypotension and acidosis, and she may require increased insulin therapy or other medications to manage her blood sugar levels.
8. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen due to her prolonged bed rest and immobility, and she may require wound care and pressure ulcer prevention measures.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing multiple medical complications, including sepsis, hypercarbic respiratory distress, ESRD, CAD, CHF, LGIB, DM, and decubitus ulcer. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and has a history of sepsis, acute kidney injury, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with the development of hypercapnic acidosis, likely due to uremia, and runs of ventricular bigeminy, also likely related to uremia.

The patient has a history of acute pain, chronic pain, depression, and impaired skin integrity. They are also experiencing hypotension, which is not thought to be in shock.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction. Their coagulation profile is abnormal, with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which may indicate bleeding risk.

The patient's medical treatment plan includes antibiotics, vasopressors, and dialysis, as well as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's hypercapnic acidosis and runs of ventricular bigeminy may indicate worsening respiratory failure, which could lead to further decline in their condition.
2. Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications and increased mortality risk.
3. Bleeding risk: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may indicate an increased risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
4. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and presence of central lines may increase their risk of developing infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections or wound infections.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's runs of ventricular bigeminy may indicate cardiac instability, which could lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), and Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and sepsis. Overnight, her condition worsened, becoming more unresponsive. She was found to have a First-degree Atrioventricular (AV) block and was receiving norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. Her respiratory status was stable, with a SpO2 of 96% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her abdominal examination was soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds were present.

Labs and radiology results showed:

* WBC count: 19.1-17.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 177-255 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.6-3.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25-33 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139-107 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.3-4.3 mEq/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent septicemia and pressor requirement increase the risk of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of AKI.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's First-degree AV block and underlying CHF increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's C. diff colitis and sepsis increase the risk of further infections, particularly in the ICU setting.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of oral intake increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure on the sacrum increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
8. DVT and pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and risk factors for DVT increase the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism.

Given the patient's critical illness, close monitoring and management of her condition are essential to prevent these potential complications and optimize her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with ESRD, PVD, CHF, and a history of C. diff colitis and sepsis. She has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving treatment for her conditions. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has become more unresponsive and has required increasing amounts of pressor support. Her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory status has worsened, with increased crackles in her lungs and a need for oxygen therapy. Her laboratory results show evidence of septicemia, with elevated WBC count and lactate levels. The patient is also at risk for DVT, stress ulceration, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent septicemia and pressor requirement put her at risk for developing septic shock, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and need for oxygen therapy increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's underlying CHF and acute diastolic heart failure put her at risk for cardiac failure, which could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and lack of recent dialysis increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury or further worsening of her renal function.
5. Infection: The patient's C. diff colitis and sepsis put her at risk for developing further infections, such as VAP, which could lead to sepsis and death.
6. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged pressor support and potential need for invasive procedures increase her risk of bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhage and death.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and risk factors for DVT increase her risk of developing a DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
8. Stress ulceration: The patient's critical illness and potential need for invasive procedures increase her risk of developing stress ulceration, which could lead to bleeding and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for chronic renal failure, depression, acute and chronic pain, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including central venous catheterization, dialysis catheter placement, and arterial line insertion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 55/31 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, and decreased albumin and calcium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture is pending, and the presence of sepsis cannot be ruled out. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure is a significant concern, and the patient may require ongoing dialysis therapy to manage electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the presence of hypotension can lead to decreased organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers is high.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of respiratory failure is increased due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypotension.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and the risk of cardiac arrest is increased due to the patient's chronic heart failure and hypotension.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case requiring close monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions. The patient's potential medical complications are numerous, and it is essential to implement strategies to prevent and manage these complications to improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia.
   Patient has been made CMO by her family.  She is currently made
   comfortable on a fentanyl drip.
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive regimen until
   resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin, add back zosyn and daptomycin as
   the patient continues to be hypotensive with a pressor requirement.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   -          HD vs CVVH today for volume removal and acidosis treatment
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors thus may need CVVH
   - Will give 150mEq of Bicarb for acidosis treatment
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K yesterday

   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diverticulitis. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and sepsis, likely secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. Diff.). The patient has been made CMO by her family and is currently comfortable on a fentanyl drip. She has been diagnosed with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and her renal function is worsening.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen due to the increasing WBC count and the presence of C. Diff. in her system.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis may lead to further respiratory distress, especially if her ABG values continue to deteriorate.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to further decline in her kidney function, requiring more frequent hemodialysis.
4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and ischial spines is at risk of worsening due to her immobility and poor circulation.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure puts her at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of C. Diff. in her system make her susceptible to further infections, such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status and lack of appetite may lead to malnutrition, which can further exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including her blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics to treat the patient's sepsis and C. Diff. infection.
3. Consider weaning the patient off the pressors and hypertensive regimen once her blood pressure stabilizes.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her dialysis schedule as necessary.
5. Consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist to manage her decubitus ulcers.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nutritionist to develop a personalized nutrition plan to improve her nutritional status."
