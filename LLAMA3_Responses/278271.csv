   Assessment and Plan: 84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis
   who presents from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia,
   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - If remains hypoxic, could consider a right heart cath to evaluate
   filling pressures.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints if chest pain and no
   iscemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.
   - will repeat TTE in am
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, and is supertherapeutic at 4.2, so
   will hold.
   .
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and CCB
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   1.9 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - send urine lytes, no casts on recent UA
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.
   - Continue current dose of Prednisone
   - Bactrim DS daily for prophylaxis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who was transferred to the ICU from the rehab unit with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxia, and has been treated with oxygen therapy, diuresis, and antibiotics. Her current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She has a history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis, and is being treated with supportive oxygen therapy and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis suggest a high risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF, elevated BNP, and hypoxia suggest a high risk of heart failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation may contribute to her acute diastolic heart failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of hypertension suggest a high risk of acute renal failure.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of hypertension and immobility suggest a high risk of DVT.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient's history of polymyositis and use of steroids suggest a high risk of stress ulcer.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of ventilator support and antibiotics suggest a high risk of VAP.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's history of polymyositis and use of steroids suggest a high risk of malnutrition.
9. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis suggest a high risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive oxygen therapy and antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's heart failure symptoms and adjust diuresis and beta-blocker therapy as needed.
3. Continue metoprolol and uptitrate as tolerated for atrial fibrillation.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuresis and beta-blocker therapy as needed.
5. Consider a right heart catheterization to evaluate filling pressures.
6. Monitor the patient's DVT risk and consider prophylactic anticoagulation.
7. Monitor the patient's stress ulcer risk and consider prophylactic antacids.
8. Monitor the patient's VAP risk and consider prophylactic antibiotics.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral nutrition support."

   .
   #. Hypoxia: Differential for patient's hypoxia includes blossoming PNA
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis vs. flash pulmonary edema with dCHF and AF
   vs. PE.  The patient has been significantly diureesed during the course
   of the hospitalization, and on exam appears euvolemic to dry.  Patient
   was not acutly hypertensive during inciting event, and only became
   hypertensive in setting of prolonged hypoxia.  Chest XR without
   evidence of acute pulmonary edema.  Patient currently being treated for
   pneumonia and has been afebrile.  Chest CT shows dependent area of
   nodular opacities which could be consistent with infection vs.
   aspiration.  Patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow
   study, and overall would feel that this would be most likely
   explanation of patinet's hypoxia and current equally rapid
   improvement.  PE seems less likely given supratherapeutic INR
   throughout hospitalization.
   - continue on supportive O2 and ween as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - will continue antibiotics of vanc/levo/flagyl
   - follow up blood and sputumc cultures
   - will consider repeat S/S eval in AM, but in the interim, will follow
   their previous recommendations.
   - If remains hypoxic, could consider a right heart cath to evaluate
   filling pressures.

   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints if chest pain and no
   iscemic changes on EKG.

   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.
   - will repeat TTE in am

   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.

   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, and is supertherapeutic at 4.2, so
   will hold.
   .
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis, who was admitted to the ICU with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She was transferred from a rehabilitation hospital and has been acutely worsened hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%. She is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-developed female in no acute distress, with a supple neck and a normal cardiac examination. Her lungs are diffuse, with a slight wheeze, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her skin shows lower extremity stasis dermatitis.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 537 K/uL, and creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen is 90 mg/dL, and her glucose is 90 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, and the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, flash pulmonary edema with diastolic CHF and atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's chest X-ray is negative for acute pulmonary edema, and her chest CT shows dependent nodular opacities that could be consistent with infection or aspiration. The patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow study, and the most likely explanation for her hypoxia is aspiration.

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, hypertension, acute renal failure, polymyositis, and hypercholesterolemia. She is taking medications for these conditions, including beta-blockers, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing supportive oxygen therapy, weaning as tolerated, and holding further diuresis for now. She will continue to receive antibiotics for pneumonia and will have repeat blood and sputum cultures. She will also have a repeat swallow study to evaluate her ability to swallow safely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia could worsen, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Aspiration: The patient could aspirate food or liquids, leading to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF could worsen, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as heart failure or stroke.
8. Polymyositis: The patient's polymyositis could worsen, leading to muscle weakness and respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and to optimize her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old woman, was transferred to the ICU from rehabilitation with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She has a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis. Overnight, she was taken off bipap and put on 100% face tent due to respiratory distress and hypoxia. She was weaned to 6L nc but was in the high 80% and put back on the face tent. This morning, she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress, and was feeling well without complaints. She wants to eat regular food.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and is being treated with supportive O2 and weaned as tolerated.
2. Coronaries: no history of coronary artery disease, and last PMIBI showed no defects.
3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: mild diastolic dysfunction on last TTE, with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity edema. The patient is being treated with diuresis, beta-blocker, and low sodium diet.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: new diagnosis, likely contributing to element of acute diastolic heart failure. The patient is being treated with metoprolol and anticoagulation.
5. Hypertension: history of hypertension, with BP 189/86 on admission. The patient is being treated with metoprolol and Verapamil.
6. Acute Renal Failure: Cr 1.9 after aggressive diuresis. The patient is being treated with f/u urine lytes, hold on further diuresis, and hold on [**Last Name (un) **].
7. Polymyositis: patient takes 60 mg prednisone every other day, and steroids were increased during this admission to 60mg PO qday.
8. Hypercholesterolemia: patient takes simvastatin 10mg daily.

The patient's current vital signs are:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis, who was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation hospital with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, acute diastolic heart failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently receiving supportive oxygen therapy, diuretics, and beta-blockers. Her recent laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's current condition, including atrial fibrillation and elevated BNP levels, may lead to further worsening of her acute diastolic heart failure, potentially resulting in cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's current creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and BUN level of 37 mg/dL indicate ongoing acute renal failure. If not managed promptly, this may lead to further decline in renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current oxygen requirements and decreased lung function may lead to respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current respiratory symptoms may increase her risk of developing a secondary infection, potentially requiring antibiotic therapy.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's current nutritional status and potential for malabsorption due to her respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms may lead to malnutrition, potentially exacerbating her underlying medical conditions.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and potential for prolonged bed rest may increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers, potentially leading to further complications and morbidity.
8. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's current anticoagulation therapy and history of hypertension may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above.
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   .  .
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.
      B. Effortful swallow with small bites of food x 2.
      C. [**1-20**] follow-up sips of thin liquid to clear pharyngeal
         residue.
      D. Alternate bites and sips.
      E. Cough after follow-up swallows to clear any penetration.
      F. NO Talking until follow-up swallows/sips have been used
         after each bite.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who was admitted to the ICU with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She has a history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis, not CHF. The patient is currently on supportive oxygen therapy and has been weaned to 6L NC with SpO2 in the 92-95% range. She has been taking metoprolol 50mg TID, verapamil 40mg Q8H, and lasix, which has been held due to acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, trace LE pre-tibial edema, and stasis dermatitis. Her lab results show anemia, hyperglycemia, and acute renal failure. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her EKG shows sinus bradycardia.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, acute renal failure, polymyositis, and hypercholesterolemia. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis and is at high risk for aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis, she is at high risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and coarse breath sounds bilaterally may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's polymyositis and polymicrobial infection may lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's aspiration and history of polymyositis may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage.

Based on the patient's conditions and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue supportive oxygen therapy and wean as tolerated.
2. Hold further diuresis until the patient's ARF is resolved.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and EKG for any signs of cardiac complications.
4. Manage the patient's hypertension with metoprolol and diltiazem.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as necessary.
6. Continue prophylactic antibiotics for polymicrobial infection.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and manage any complications that arise.
8. Consider PEG tube placement to reduce the risk of aspiration."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.  She is persistently
   hypoxic and requiring 6L NC of O2.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - wean steroids to Prednisone 60mg PO qday
   - Pulm consult for persistent hypoxia, ?aspiration of foreign body
   (food)
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID for persistent bradycardia
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID and continue Diltiazem 30mg PO TID
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive.
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID and continue Diltiazem as above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, rose to
   2.3 and now 1.9.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased to
   Solumedrol 80mg q8 hours.
   - change to Prednisone 60mg PO qday today.
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and polymyositis, who presents with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis. The patient has been transferred to the CCU and is currently requiring 6L of oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 59 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/63 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis, and not CHF. She has been informed of the need for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube due to her high risk of aspiration, but she refuses this intervention and continues to eat. She is persistently hypoxic and requires supportive oxygen therapy.

The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis, and is currently in sinus rhythm. She has mild diastolic dysfunction and mild aortic stenosis, and her ejection fraction is 55-60%. She has also developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of polymyositis, for which she takes prednisone 60mg every other day. Her steroids were increased to Solumedrol 80mg q8 hours, but will be weaned to Prednisone 60mg PO qday today.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, which is a serious complication that requires prompt treatment.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is a significant complication that requires anticoagulation and rate control.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
4. Polymyositis: The patient's history of polymyositis requires ongoing management with prednisone and other medications to prevent exacerbation.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated in the past, and requires ongoing management to prevent complications.
6. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's mild diastolic dysfunction and mild aortic stenosis require ongoing management to prevent complications.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis increases her risk of developing pneumonia, which requires prompt treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient's acute renal failure and polymyositis increase her risk of developing sepsis, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases her risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which require prompt recognition and treatment.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and aspiration pneumonitis increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's polymyositis and acute renal failure increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, which require prompt recognition and treatment.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications and potential medical complications. She requires ongoing management and close monitoring to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who
   presents from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia,
   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient continued to require 6L of oxygen.  Her prednisone was
   stopped and she was given 80 mg IV solumedrol instead for possible
   bronchospasm from metoprolol.  Her UCx returned with ecoli, but she is
   on levofloxacin so she should be covered for a UTI (her UA from that
   sample was negative anyway so it is likely colonization).  Her
   verapamil was stopped and she was placed on diltiazem 30 mg tid given
   the hypotension she had with verapamil yesterday.  Her vanc was dc'ed
   today as she is unlikely to have a MRSA infection.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who was admitted to the ICU with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She was transferred from a rehabilitation hospital and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia, and her oxygen requirements have increased to 6L. She has a history of asthma and is taking metoprolol, which may be contributing to bronchospasm. The patient has also developed atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to respiratory failure and death if not managed promptly.
2. Bronchospasm: The patient's history of asthma and use of metoprolol may be contributing to bronchospasm, which can worsen her hypoxia and respiratory status.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation can lead to acute diastolic heart failure, which can worsen her hypoxia and respiratory status.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation increase her risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis and bronchospasm increase her risk of respiratory complications, including respiratory failure and pneumonia.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's polymyositis and history of gastrointestinal symptoms increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirements and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's bronchospasm with albuterol and atrovent nebs.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with fluid restriction and electrolyte management.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy and respiratory support as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust her medication regimen and dietary intake as needed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."
