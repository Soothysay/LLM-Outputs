   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical history of
   hypertension and depression who presented with several days of chest
   pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD, transferred to
   CCU for closer monitoring and BP control.
   .
   # Chest pain/CORONARIES: Now s/p cath which revealed 3VD. Will likely
   need bypass surgery. Nitro gtt if needed for further chest pain.
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CT surgery c/s to evaluate for need for bypass
   - continue ASA, hold plavix given need for upcoming bypass surgery,
   beta-blocker, integrillin drip until the AM, statin
   - Titrate nitroglycerin drip to pain free and adequate BP control
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # PUMP:
   - continue BB and [**Last Name (un) 284**], TTE in AM to assess EF
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly sinus but one episode of VT lasting 3min.  VT likely
   reactive to ongoing ischemia.
   - If VT returns, would consider lidocaine if stable BP.  Cardiovert of
   hypotension
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Depression: Continue Wellbutrin.
   - consider social work c/s if needed
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient has history of hypertension, per report has
   been quite labile, also likely [**2-23**] cardiac dysfunction. Renal U/S was
   negative for renal artery stenosis.
   - Continue diovan and BB
   - nitro gtt as needed, goal SBP 120 to 150 and DBP > 60 for adequate
   coronary perfusion
   .
   # Epistaxis - One episode which resolved. OK to restart integrillin. If
   further bleeding, will c/s ENT.
   .
   # FEN: cardiac healthy diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and depression, who presented with several days of chest pain and was found to have a NSTEMI. She underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3VD, and is now being monitored in the CCU for closer monitoring and BP control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 132/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her cardiac rhythm is mostly sinus, with one episode of VT lasting 3 minutes, which is likely reactive to ongoing ischemia.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and her BP is being controlled with medications. She has also had an episode of epistaxis, which has resolved, and is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's lab results show elevated cardiac enzymes, with a troponin-T level of 1.75 ng/mL, and an elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing cardiac enzymes and serial EKGs
* Cycling cardiac enzymes and considering bypass surgery
* Continuing ASA, beta-blocker, and integrillin drip until the AM
* Titrating nitroglycerin drip to pain-free and adequate BP control
* Monitoring for VT and considering lidocaine if stable BP
* Continuing Wellbutrin for depression
* Considering social work consultation if needed
* Continuing diovan and beta-blocker for hypertension
* Monitoring for further epistaxis and considering ENT consultation if needed
* Continuing cardiac healthy diet

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT or fibrillation
* Cardiac tamponade or pericarditis
* Myocardial infarction or extension of existing infarction
* Cardiac rupture or papillary muscle rupture
* Hypertensive crisis or hypotension
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypertension or cardiac failure
* Bleeding or hematoma due to epistaxis or other bleeding complications
* Infection or sepsis due to central venous catheter or other invasive devices
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to cardiac failure or other underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and depression, who presented with several days of chest pain and was found to have a NSTEMI. She underwent catheterization and was diagnosed with 3VD. She is currently in the ICU for closer monitoring and BP control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/58 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of cardiac failure, lung disease, or other systemic illnesses.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.75 ng/mL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.6%

The patient is receiving various medications, including nitroglycerin, eptifibatide, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and pantoprazole.

The patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac complications: Given her diagnosis of 3VD and history of hypertension, the patient is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula, but she may require more aggressive respiratory support if her condition deteriorates.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, which is within normal limits, but she may be at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening kidney function.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with eptifibatide, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her hospitalization and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical
   history of hypertension and depression who presented with several days
   of chest pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD,
   transferred to CCU for closer monitoring and BP control
   24 Hour Events:
   Several runs of self terminated, asymptomatic slow VT. No EKG obtained.
   ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
   or with Valsalva. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.8°C, Tcurrent of 37.2°C, HR of 68 bpm, BP of 142/62 mmHg, RR of 10 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of jugular venous distension, murmurs, or gallop rhythms. Her lungs are clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, and her EKG shows no signs of ischemia or infarction.

The patient's plan includes:

* CABG in the morning
* Stopping integrillin at 3:30 am
* Off heparin drip
* No need for nitro drip for BP or pain
* Continue ASA, beta-blocker, and statin
* Serial daily EKGs
* Preop studies: CXR, carotid US, and UA
* NPO after midnight, transfer to SICU after CABG

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, which may require treatment with lidocaine
* Cardiac tamponade, which may require pericardiocentesis
* Renal insufficiency, which may require adjustment of diuretic therapy
* Respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical
   history of hypertension and depression who presented with several days
   of chest pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD,
   transferred to CCU for closer monitoring and BP control
   24 Hour Events:
   Tele->1min bigemeny followed by 3 min V tach (broke seconds before EKG
   was ready).
   ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
   or with Valsalva. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Cardiac tamponade due to the 3VD and possible cardiac surgery
* Pulmonary edema due to the increased left ventricular filling pressure
* Respiratory distress due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions
* Renal insufficiency due to the patient's hypertension and potential nephrotoxic medications
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and possible cardiac surgery
* Infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and potential invasive procedures
* Depression and anxiety due to the patient's underlying depression and possible pain and discomfort from the cardiac condition."
