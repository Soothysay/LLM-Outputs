You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia (pna). She has a history of recent stroke and failed speech and swallow evaluation, making her a high-risk candidate for aspiration. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2. She has a fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, and is receiving antibiotics and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and abnormal liver function tests. Her troponin level is slightly elevated, but her electrocardiogram does not show any signs of ischemia. Her cortisol level is elevated, suggesting that central adrenal insufficiency is unlikely.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics and vasopressors, weaning the ventilator as tolerated, and monitoring for signs of sepsis and shock. She will also receive daily risbi and have her lactate levels followed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of pneumonia and her underlying respiratory disease.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Aspiration: The patient's history of failed speech and swallow evaluation and her high-risk status for aspiration make it likely that she will aspirate, which could lead to pneumonia and other complications.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low albumin level and hypocalcemia make it difficult to assess her calcium levels, which could lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and other symptoms.
5. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may worsen due to her underlying disease and the lack of adequate iron supplementation.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to her underlying disease and the use of vasopressors.
7. Thyroid dysfunction: The patient's low TSH level and goiter suggest that she may have thyroid dysfunction, which could lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's elevated cortisol level suggests that central adrenal insufficiency is unlikely, but it is still possible that she may have adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and low blood pressure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feedsbut
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration.
   - reposition ET tube
   - Vanco/Zosyn, consider double GNR coverage or atypical
   - sputum cx
   - urine legionella
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient has fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most likely this
   is septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Could
   also have component of central adrenal insufficiency given pituitary
   macroadenoma (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  Neuro: h/o right ACA stroke recently.
   - Ct asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   unclear if there is a clinical syndrome.
   - check Free T4
   .
   #  anemia: at baseline.
   - t & s
   .
   #  hypocalcemia: unclear cause, low albumin makes it difficult to
   assess.
   - check ionized calcium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. She has a recent history of acute ischemic stroke affecting the right anterior cerebral artery. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 145 bpm, blood pressure of 124/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a multifocal right lobe infiltrate on her chest x-ray, and her sputum culture is pending.

The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin, and has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place. She is also receiving medications for pain, sedation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin levels, suggesting possible septic shock and cardiac injury. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's plan of care includes repositioning her endotracheal tube, continuing antibiotics, and weaning her ventilator as tolerated. She will also be monitored for signs of sepsis, cardiac injury, and neurologic deterioration.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she has a multifocal right lobe infiltrate on her chest x-ray, which may indicate pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin levels suggest possible septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin levels and abnormal EKG suggest possible cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Neurologic deterioration: The patient has a recent history of acute ischemic stroke, and her elevated lactate levels and abnormal EKG suggest possible neurologic deterioration, which can lead to decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and brain death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her ventilator settings are not optimized, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
6. Shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest possible shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Infection: The patient's abnormal laboratory results, including elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, suggest possible infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 3 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 10/5
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - CT head without contrast
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline.
   - t & s
   .
   #  hypocalcemia: unclear cause, low albumin makes it difficult to
   assess.
   - check ionized calcium
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and sepsis. She has a recent history of stroke and is intubated due to respiratory failure. She has a stable sellar mass and no acute process on her CT head. She is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for suspected pneumonia, and has been started on early goal-directed therapy for septic shock. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. Her physical examination is notable for scattered rales and ronchi in the lungs, and her lab results show elevated lactate levels and a troponin-T of 0.07.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and troponin-T suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, and can lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
4. Shock: The patient's septic shock can lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Stroke: The patient's recent history of stroke and current symptoms suggest the possibility of another stroke or bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow failure.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may be due to low albumin levels, which can make it difficult to assess.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's low TSH and goiter suggest hypothyroidism, which can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
9. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to chronic disease, medication, or secondary to other medical conditions.
10. Infection: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest the possibility of an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following interventions should be considered:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.
2. Continue early goal-directed therapy for septic shock.
3. Monitor lactate levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Wean ventilator support as tolerated.
5. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Monitor for signs of stroke or bleeding.
7. Consider thyroid replacement therapy if hypothyroidism is confirmed.
8. Monitor for signs of anemia or bleeding.
9. Consider calcium supplementation if hypocalcemia persists.
10. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of stroke, hypertension, and possible pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F) with a spike to 100.7°F, then decreased to 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute with a normal sinus rhythm
* Blood pressure: 156/77 mmHg with a range of 112/44 mmHg to 175/85 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on CPAP/PSV

The patient has a CT head scan showing a stable sellar mass and no acute process. They have a moderate bacteremia and were restarted on vancomycin and zosyn.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 336 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 135 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* LDH: 299 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis progression to septic shock
2. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance
3. Increased risk of pneumonia progression and respiratory failure
4. Electrolyte imbalance and arrhythmias due to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
6. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
7. Increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to hypertension and electrolyte imbalance
8. Potential for nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

The patient requires close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support. Antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary. Electrolyte and fluid management should be optimized to prevent complications. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to sedation and pain management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a continued evolution of a right anterior cerebral artery (RACA) infarct, stable sellar mass, and no acute process on CT head. The patient has developed hypertension, with blood pressures ranging from 156/77 to 210/44 mmHg. Fever spiked to 100.7°C, and pan-culture revealed moderate bacteria, prompting the restart of vancomycin and zosyn. The patient is receiving various medications, including anticoagulation, diuretics, and acid suppression. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, as well as electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing sepsis. If left untreated, this could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which may lead to end-organ damage, particularly in the kidneys, brain, and eyes. Aggressive blood pressure management is necessary to prevent this.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently adequate, but the risk of respiratory failure remains high, particularly if the underlying cause of the pneumonia is not addressed.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not corrected.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential kidney dysfunction, which could worsen if not addressed through aggressive fluid management and diuretic therapy.
6. Neurological compromise: The patient's RACA infarct and altered mental status raise concerns about potential neurological compromise, particularly if the infarct is expanding or causing increased intracranial pressure.
7. Infection control: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Failure to control this infection could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 3 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 10/5
   - daily risbi
   - wean vent as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy
   - Follow lactates
   - r/o MI
   - cortisol level
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - CT head without contrast
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, holding home medications of
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline.
   - t & s
   .
   #  hypocalcemia: unclear cause, low albumin makes it difficult to
   assess.
   - check ionized calcium
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock and respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia. The patient has a history of right ACA stroke and is at high risk for aspiration due to failed speech and swallow evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.7°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/77 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a number of lab abnormalities, including:

* WBC count of 19.4 K/uL
* Hct of 28.9%
* Plt count of 336 K/uL
* Cr of 0.6 mg/dL
* TCO2 of 20 mmHg
* Glucose of 135 mg/dL
* Lactic acid of 1.6 mmol/L
* LDH of 299 IU/L
* Ca++ of 7.4 mg/dL
* Mg++ of 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4 of 1.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including:

* Vancomycin and Zosyn for 10 days
* Lasix for hypertension
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Furosemide for fluid management

The patient's physical examination is notable for scattered rales and rhonchi in the right lung field, and a slight edema in the left arm.

The patient's medical history is significant for a right ACA stroke, pituitary macroadenoma, and a history of hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration
* Shock due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes
* Hypertension due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Anemia due to blood loss or bone marrow suppression
* Hypocalcemia due to low albumin or other causes
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid management or other causes
* Adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma
* Pneumonia or other infections due to immuno-compromise
* Cardiovascular events due to hypertension or other causes
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or other causes
* Renal failure due to sepsis or other causes

The patient's family is aware of her code status and wishes to continue to feed her, despite the high risk of aspiration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 4 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 5/5
   - daily RSBI
 93 this AM
   - Will attempt to extubate today
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - ABG after extubation
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be in fluid overload, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure
   likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 4 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 5/5
   - daily RSBI
 93 this AM
   - Will attempt to extubate today
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - ABG after extubation
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be in fluid overload, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; plan to replace A-line today.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of right ACA stroke, currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.
* She has developed shock and respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia (pna).
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/77 mmHg.
* She has a history of pituitary macroadenoma and has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, which has resolved.
* Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T, indicating possible septic shock.
* She has been started on antibiotics and has received early goal-directed therapy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Given the patient's history of failed speech and swallow and recent stroke, she is at high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's elevated lactate level and troponin-T suggest possible septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not managed promptly.
3. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's increased urine output and stable creatinine level suggest fluid overload, which can exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
4. **Pituitary Insufficiency:** The patient's history of pituitary macroadenoma and elevated cortisol level on admission suggest possible pituitary insufficiency, which can lead to adrenal crisis if not managed properly.
5. **Hypertension:** The patient's history of hypertension and current blood pressure of 156/77 mmHg suggest the need for close monitoring and management to prevent complications.
6. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
7. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's elevated troponin-T and possible septic shock suggest the need for close monitoring of her cardiovascular status to prevent complications such as cardiogenic shock.

**Plan:**

1. Continue antibiotics and early goal-directed therapy to manage septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation when stable.
3. Continue diuresis to manage fluid overload.
4. Monitor the patient's lactate level and troponin-T to assess for sepsis and cardiac complications.
5. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and stress ulcer precautions.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and calcium level to prevent hypocalcemia.
7. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist and intensivist to manage the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note and may not be exhaustive. A thorough review of the patient's medical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment and plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis now with
   persistent ventilatory failure.  She has current barriers to extubation
   of mental status and volume overload.  She has had favorable RSBI and
   good stability of oxygenation and ventilation on support.  Despite
   significant altered mental status patient had CT without significant
   change.  She has had some increased response to stimulus in regards to
   gag reflex with suctioning but is unable to follow any commands.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE---Current barriers to be addressed as follows
   -Continue to hold all sedation and follow exam
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn and of note secretion volume is minimal
   -Lasix now for attempted diuresis and will increase dose
   -SBT now and will check gas at 60 minutes
HR=98, SBP=154 at start of
   trail.
   -If unfavorable will need to continue with diruesis for additional time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female admitted with pneumonia and resultant sepsis now with
   persistent ventilatory failure.  She has current barriers to extubation
   of mental status and volume overload.  She has had favorable RSBI and
   good stability of oxygenation and ventilation on support.  Despite
   significant altered mental status patient had CT without significant
   change.  She has had some increased response to stimulus in regards to
   gag reflex with suctioning but is unable to follow any commands.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE---Current barriers to be addressed as follows
   -Continue to hold all sedation and follow exam
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn and of note secretion volume is minimal
   -Lasix now for attempted diuresis and will increase dose
   -SBT now and will check gas at 60 minutes
HR=98, SBP=154 at start of
   trail.
   -If unfavorable will need to continue with diruesis for additional time

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with pneumonia and sepsis, currently experiencing persistent ventilatory failure. The patient has a CVA, fever, and hypertension. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/73 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory failure, including diminished breath sounds and symmetric expansion. Her abdominal examination is normal, with soft and non-tender abdomen, and bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and normal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's mental status is altered, with no response to voice commands, but she does respond to noxious stimuli. She has had a CT scan without significant change.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and altered mental status, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has not resolved, and there is a risk of progression to septic shock.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but there is a risk of developing electrolyte imbalances due to the use of diuretics and other medications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and altered mental status may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Wound complications: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and altered mental status may increase the risk of developing wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to address potential medical complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right ACA stroke and pituitary adenoma, admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved since extubation, with improving ABGs and decreased RSBI. The patient is likely to continue to improve with diuresis.

The patient's shock is likely septic in origin, secondary to pneumonia, and early goal-directed therapy has been initiated. The patient's lactate levels are trending down and are now stable within a range of 1.7. The patient appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, and Lasix will be continued to manage this.

The patient's altered mental status is likely related to her recent right ACA stroke, and she is less alert than previously. An MRI head showed continued evolution of the infarct, with no new changes.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis, and acetazolamide has been started to manage this. The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding home medications and monitoring blood pressure closely.

The patient's hypocalcemia has resolved, and the cause is unclear due to low albumin levels. The patient's anemia is at baseline, and her thyroid function is normal.

The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and her IV fluids are being managed to maintain goal levels. The patient's access lines include a RIJ CVL and an A-line, and she is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and potential aspiration pneumonia.
2. Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue to be managed with early goal-directed therapy, but she may still be at risk for cardiac arrest or organ dysfunction.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to her recent stroke, and she may continue to experience confusion or disorientation.
4. Fluid overload: The patient appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, and Lasix will be continued to manage this. However, she may still be at risk for fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, but she may still be at risk for developing secondary infections or sepsis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of pituitary adenoma and stroke may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and anemia may continue to be managed with medications and close monitoring, but she may still be at risk for metabolic complications, such as hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89F with shock and respiratory failure likely from pna.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day 4 Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - change to PSV 5/5
   - daily RSBI
 93 this AM
   - Will attempt to extubate today
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - ABG after extubation
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be in fluid overload, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; plan to replace A-line today.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with shock and respiratory failure likely caused by pneumonia. She has a recent history of right ACA stroke and failed speech and swallow, making her a high-risk candidate for aspiration. She was extubated and is being managed with antibiotics, diuresis, and respiratory support. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory status is improving, with a reduction in respiratory rate and an increase in partial pressure of oxygen. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and normal electrolyte levels. She is being managed with early goal-directed therapy and is at risk for fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate if she develops pneumonia or another respiratory infection.
2. Shock: The patient may experience recurrent shock if her sepsis is not properly managed.
3. Aspiration: The patient's high-risk status for aspiration may lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if she continues to receive excessive fluids or if her kidneys are not functioning properly.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised, making her susceptible to further infections.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent history of stroke and hypertension may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent history of stroke and altered mental status may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or aspiration.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's recent history of stroke and altered mental status may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or worsening of her neurological deficits."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. They were extubated 24 hours ago and have shown excellent respiratory status with a RSBI and SBT. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/69 mmHg. They have a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination is significant for scattered rales and rhonchi in the lungs, and their abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 15.8 K/μL, with a platelet count of 362 K/μL and a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 27 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for respiratory failure due to their underlying condition and potential for nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis has not progressed to organ dysfunction, but they are at risk for further deterioration if not properly managed.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but they are at risk for imbalances due to their underlying condition and potential for fluid and electrolyte shifts.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is normal, but they are at risk for renal dysfunction due to their underlying condition and potential for nephrotoxic medications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they are at risk for cardiovascular complications due to their underlying condition and potential for hypertension.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for nosocomial infections, particularly pneumonia, due to their prolonged stay in the ICU.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal examination is normal, but they are at risk for gastrointestinal complications due to their underlying condition and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is altered, but they are at risk for further neurological deterioration due to their underlying condition and potential for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains stable, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic status is also stable, with a blood pressure of 150/69 mmHg and a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg.

The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is likely due to the use of diuretics and fluid administration. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the use of sedatives and analgesics. The patient's pneumonia is likely due to aspiration or nosocomial infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation requirements increase.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is stable, but there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias if the patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, but there is a risk of sepsis progressing to organ dysfunction if the patient's infection is not managed properly.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely due to aspiration or nosocomial infection, and there is a risk of pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure or sepsis if not managed properly.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is likely due to the use of diuretics and fluid administration, and there is a risk of electrolyte and fluid disorder worsening if not managed properly.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the use of sedatives and analgesics, and there is a risk of altered mental status worsening if not managed properly.

In conclusion, the patient's condition remains stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure that the patient's condition is managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line, would like to add PICC and d/c RIJ
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves, PT c/s and CM
   for poss tx to MACU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line, would like to add PICC and d/c RIJ
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves, PT c/s and CM

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right ACA stroke, pituitary adenoma, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted with shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and septic shock.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/69 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL and a hematocrit of 25.1%. Her white blood cell count is 15.8 K/uL, and her platelet count is 362 K/uL. Her liver function tests are normal, with a total bilirubin level of 0.3 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 114 IU/L.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with an arterial blood gas showing a pH of 7.50, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 41 mmHg, and a partial pressure of oxygen of 585 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

The patient's medical complications include septic shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. She also has metabolic alkalosis, which is being treated with acetazolamide. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, a sodium level of 138 mEq/L, and a chloride level of 102 mEq/L.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing her antibiotics, diuresis, and respiratory support. She will also receive further evaluation and treatment for her pituitary adenoma and possible thyroid dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and pneumonia (aspiration vs nosocomial). The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/65 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 99% and ABG results within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis diagnosis without organ dysfunction may not necessarily indicate that the sepsis is resolving. There is a risk of sepsis progression, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be a concern for end-organ damage, particularly in the kidneys and brain.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hyperglycemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of underlying infection, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the underlying cause and prevent potential complications.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia diagnosis is unclear, and further evaluation is necessary to determine if it is aspiration or nosocomial in origin. There is a risk of pneumonia progression, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk for DVT and VAP due to immobility and invasive medical devices. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent these complications.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to critical illness and the use of anticoagulants. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent this complication.
8. Medication side effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of medication side effects, particularly with antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants. Close monitoring and titration of medications are necessary to minimize side effects."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes, TF at goal
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: RIJ CVL; A-line, would like to add PICC and d/c RIJ
   # Code: presumed full
   # Communication: Patient's family
   # Disposition: to floor as respiratory status improves, PT c/s and CM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**5-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Extubated [**2127-3-6**] -> ABGs improving
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent).
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now stable in range of 1.7
   - r/o MI, although likely trop leak
   - Now appears to be mildly fluid overloaded, so will continue Lasix as
   UOP has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, however patient is less alert
   than she was previously.
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Tried one dose of metoprolol with some decr in HR and BP, but will
   hold off until extubated and diuresed
   - Has periods of MAT, will incr metoprolol
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female admitted to the MICU with shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. She has a known history of right ACA CVA, pituitary adenoma, and recent aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/65 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool O2 delivery device.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.8-16.3 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 28.3-26.1%
* Plt: 362-304 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 25-33 mmol/L
* Glucose: 102-130 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.0/31.9/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 44/5/0.07, ALT/AST: 30/44, Alk Phos/T Bili: 114/0.3, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, LDH: 299 IU/L, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.3/2.1/3.3 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is hypoxic with a CXR showing multifocal right lobe infiltrate. She has recent ACA stroke and failed speech and swallow, making her a high-risk candidate for aspiration. Urine and BAL Legionella tests were negative. The plan is to continue Vanco/Zosyn for 10 days, extubate the patient, and wean O2 as tolerated.
* Shock: The patient was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, likely due to septic shock secondary to pneumonia. The plan is to continue early goal-directed therapy and monitor lactates.
* AMS: The patient has a history of right ACA stroke and is less alert than previously. The plan is to continue ASA and statin.
* Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has alkalosis in the setting of Lasix, likely due to contraction alkalosis. The plan is to start acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses and continue at 500 mg TID, holding for pH < 7.45.
* Hypertension: The patient's home medications of metoprolol and lisinopril were held due to hypotension. The plan is to try one dose of metoprolol and hold off until extubated and diuresed.
* Thyroid: The patient has a goiter and low TSH in the setting of pituitary macroadenoma. The plan is to follow HCT and TSH.
* Anemia: The patient's HCT is at baseline of mid-20s. The plan is to follow HCT and transfuse as needed.
* Hypocalcemia: The patient's ionized calcium is normal and stable. The plan is to replete electrolytes and follow calcium levels.
* FEN: The patient is receiving IVF PRN and replete electrolytes.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin.
* Access: The patient has an RIJ CVL and A-line, with a plan to add a PICC and discontinue the RIJ.
* Code: The patient's code status is full code.
* Disposition: The patient will be transferred to the floor as her respiratory status improves, with a plan for possible transfer to the MACU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock could progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications.
* Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia could worsen, leading to muscle cramps, tingling, and numbness.
* Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis could worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma could cause hypothyroidism, leading to fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**6-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - Started acetazolamide 250 mg Q 12 h x 2 doses, will cont at 500mg
   TID, hold for pH < 7.45
   - Goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Cont home dose metoprolol with good control of BP and tachycardia
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma;
   Free T4 1.2, wnl.
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s

Summary:

The patient is a 90+ year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. She has a history of right ACA stroke and pituitary adenoma. She was recently placed on Lasix and has been receiving antibiotics for her pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 152/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is minimally responsive to voice and has scattered rales and rhonchi in her lungs.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.8, hemoglobin of 28.3, and platelet count of 304. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated calcium level. Her lactate level is trending down, and her fluid balance is still positive.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics and Lasix, weaning off oxygen, and monitoring her lactate levels. She is also being treated for metabolic alkalosis with acetazolamide and for hypertension with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory decline, requiring increased oxygen support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac complications or cerebral bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to muscle cramps, weakness, or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and increased risk of DVT may lead to thrombosis, which could worsen if not properly managed.
8. VAP: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could worsen her respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from NH.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Day [**6-11**] Vanco/Zosyn (Day 1 [**3-3**]) for 10 day course
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   - One blood culture pos for Enterococcus, unsure of source, will speak
   with ID re: appropriate antibiotics
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - D/c acetazolamide as likely hypochloremic alkalosis, treat with KCl
   PRN
   - Cont goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Cont home dose metoprolol with good control of BP and tachycardia
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma
   - Restart Synthroid
   .
   #  Anemia: at baseline of mid 20s.
   - Follow HCT
   - t & s
   .
   #  Hypocalcemia: Resolved, unclear cause, low albumin makes it
   difficult to assess.
   -  ionized calcium nl and stable

   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC line, A-line

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a known history of right ACA stroke, pituitary adenoma, and is currently receiving treatment for septic shock, metabolic alkalosis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/65 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 406 and a SpO2 of 99%. Her laboratory results show a WBC count of 15.8, Hct of 26.1%, and platelet count of 304 K/uL.

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for further deterioration. Monitoring of her oxygen saturation and PaO2/FiO2 ratio is crucial.
2. Shock: The patient is receiving treatment for septic shock, but she is still at risk for further deterioration. Monitoring of her lactate levels and blood pressure is crucial.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to complications such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring of her electrolyte levels and acid-base status is crucial.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a known history of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
5. Pituitary adenoma: The patient has a pituitary adenoma, which can lead to hormonal imbalances and complications such as adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued treatment for septic shock, including early goal-directed therapy and monitoring of lactate levels.
2. Monitoring of her respiratory status, including oxygen saturation and PaO2/FiO2 ratio.
3. Monitoring of her electrolyte levels and acid-base status to prevent metabolic alkalosis.
4. Continued treatment for aspiration pneumonia, including antibiotics and respiratory support.
5. Monitoring of her pituitary adenoma, including hormonal levels and adrenal function.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, shock, metabolic alkalosis, aspiration pneumonia, and pituitary adenoma. Monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and plan of care is crucial to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from nursing home.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Patient hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal
   right lobe infiltrate.  Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speach
   and swallow and not thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but
   the family wanted to continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for
   aspiration. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Vanc has been d/c
d. Will continue Zosyn while in house then switch
   to Moxifloxacin 400 mg daily on discharge for a total of 14 day course.
   - Resp status likely to improve with diuresis, but complicated by
   metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean O2 as tolerated, FiO2 50% -> 35%
   - One blood culture pos for Enterococcus, unsure of source, will speak
   with ID re: appropriate antibiotics
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and likely stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.1
   - Still pos fluid balance for ICU stay, so will continue Lasix as UOP
   has increased and Cr not elevated
   .
   #  AMS: h/o right ACA stroke recently, is now somewhat responsive to
   voice, which is an improvement
   - MRI head showed continued evolution of infarct, no other new changes
   - Cont asa and statin
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: continues to have alkalosis in setting of Lasix,
   likely contraction alkalosis
   - D/c acetazolamide as likely hypochloremic alkalosis, treat with KCl
   PRN
   - Cont goal UOP > 150cc/hr
   .
   #  Hypertension:  Given hypotension, have been holding home medications
   of metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Cont home dose metoprolol with good control of BP and tachycardia
   .
   #  Thyroid:  Pt with goiter and low TSH in setting of pit macroadenoma

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of R ACA CVA, pituitary adenoma, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted with shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory status: Hypoxic with multifocal right lobe infiltrate on CXR, but expected to improve with diuresis and weaning of oxygen therapy.
* Cardiovascular status: Likely septic shock secondary to pneumonia, with a normal EKG and flat CK, but elevated troponin. Early goal-directed therapy has been initiated.
* Neurological status: Somewhat responsive to voice, with continued evolution of infarct on MRI head.
* Metabolic status: Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis, with a plan to discontinue acetazolamide and treat with KCl PRN.
* Renal status: Positive fluid balance, with a plan to continue Lasix and aim for UOP > 150cc/hr.
* Endocrine status: Hypothyroidism due to pituitary macroadenoma, with a plan to restart Synthroid.
* Hematological status: Anemia at baseline, with a plan to follow HCT.
* Electrolyte status: Hypocalcemia has resolved, but the cause is unclear.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia and aspiration can lead to worsening respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: Pneumonia can lead to sepsis, which can worsen cardiovascular and neurological status.
* Cardiovascular instability: Septic shock and hypotension can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
* Metabolic complications: Metabolic alkalosis can lead to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: Positive fluid balance and hypertension can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Endocrine complications: Hypothyroidism can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and depression.
* Hematological complications: Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased exercise tolerance.
* Electrolyte imbalances: Hypocalcemia can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's family has been informed of the plan to transfer her to a rehabilitation hospital, and the ICU team will continue to monitor her closely for any changes in her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **]F with R ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma admitted with shock
   and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a known aspiration
   pneumonia from nursing home.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure, now resolved: Was intubated on presentation.
   Patient was hypoxic with CXR showing multifocal right lobe infiltrate.
   Patient had recent ACA stroke and failed speech and swallow and not
   thought to be a good candidate for tube feeds but the family wanted to
   continue to feed her, putting her at high risk for aspiration. Likely
   had aspiration pneumonitis/PNA. Urine & BAL Legionella negative.
   - Vanc has been d/c

   contrast could not be given (pt had no peripheral access; contrast
   cannot be pushed via PICC per radiology tech)
   .
   #  Shock:  Patient admitted with fever, hypoxia, hypotension.  Most
   likely septic shock secondary to pna.  Less likely cardiogenic (trop
   slightly elevated, CK is flat, EKG without ischemic changes).  Central
   adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary macroadenoma less likely as
   cortisol elevated on admission (eos not elevated or absent). R/o MI,
   although likely trop leak
   - Early goal directed therapy initiated and stable now
   - Follow lactates, trended down, now 1.9 (Peaked at 3)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma, admitted to the ICU with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home. The patient was intubated on presentation and had a multifocal right lobe infiltrate on CXR. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy at a FiO2 of 35% and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes aerosol-cool O2 delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.2 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 308 K/μL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's lactate level is 1.9 mmol/L, and her troponin-T level is 0.07 ng/mL.

The patient's imaging studies show large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and a focus of consolidation at the left lung base on a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The patient's MRI head shows continued evolution of the infarct, with no other new changes.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, shock, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medications include Zosyn, famotidine, and metoprolol. The patient's plan includes weaning off oxygen therapy, continuing Zosyn for a total of 14 days, and switching to moxifloxacin upon discharge.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already resolved, but it is possible that it could recur if the patient's underlying condition worsens or if there are any complications related to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Enterococcus, which could indicate the presence of sepsis. The patient's lactate level is 1.9 mmol/L, which is slightly elevated, but it is possible that it could increase further if the patient's infection worsens.
3. Central adrenal insufficiency: The patient's pituitary adenoma could cause central adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to adrenal crisis if not treated promptly.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's ionized calcium level is normal and stable, but it is possible that it could decrease further if the patient's albumin level decreases or if there are any complications related to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled with metoprolol and captopril, but it is possible that it could increase further if the patient's underlying condition worsens or if there are any complications related to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.0 g/dL, which is slightly low. The patient's anemia could worsen if the patient's underlying condition worsens or if there are any complications related to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.
7. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia could worsen if the patient's underlying condition worsens or if there are any complications related to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.

In summary, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma, admitted to the ICU with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia from a nursing home. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy and antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.2 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 308 K/μL. The patient's imaging studies show large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and a focus of consolidation at the left lung base on a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, shock, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's plan includes weaning off oxygen therapy, continuing Zosyn for a total of 14 days, and switching to moxifloxacin upon discharge."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of right ACA CVA and pituitary adenoma, admitted with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and has recently stopped receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 127/51 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination is notable for scattered rales and rhonchi in the right lung, with a soft, non-tender abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalcemia, which are being managed accordingly.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a plan to wean oxygen as tolerated and adjust the FiO2 to 35%. The patient's shock is likely secondary to septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy has been initiated. The patient's adrenal function is being monitored, and corticosteroids have been discontinued due to elevated cortisol levels.

The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and potassium supplementation is being provided as needed. The patient's thyroid function is being monitored, and Synthroid has been restarted.

The patient's anemia is being followed, and the patient's blood products are being managed accordingly. The patient's wound is being managed with IVF PRN, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are being provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for oxygen therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is being managed, but there is still a risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being followed, but there is still a risk of anemia and its complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is being managed, but there is still a risk of complications, such as hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is being managed, but there is still a risk of complications, such as muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is being monitored, but there is still a risk of adrenal insufficiency and its complications, such as hypotension and shock.
7. Wound complications: The patient's wound is being managed with IVF PRN, but there is still a risk of wound complications, such as infection and dehiscence.
8. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, due to the patient's immobility and underlying condition.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and promote recovery."
