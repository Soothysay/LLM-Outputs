You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy for toxic megacolon due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis. He has a history of recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient developed hypotension with fever overnight, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressors. His condition has improved since then, with an improved central venous pressure (CVP) and a stable mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 75%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has a distended abdomen with a pink and brown stool at the end ileostomy site, and diffuse tenderness to palpation. He has a history of diverticulitis and has undergone a sigmoid colectomy in the past.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.6, a decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.0 g/dL, and an elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL. His blood cultures are negative so far.

The patient's plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, maintaining a CVP of 10, and following his urine output and creatinine levels closely. He will also be weaned off pressors and intubation, and will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, pain, and infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation. He may be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if his pressor requirements do not improve.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis and has undergone surgery, which may increase his risk of developing an infection. His blood cultures are negative so far, but he will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for hypotension, particularly if his pressor requirements do not improve.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has received a large amount of fluid, which may lead to fluid overload and compromise his respiratory function.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of recent NSTEMI and AS, which may increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure.
6. Abdominal complications: The patient has a distended abdomen and may be at risk for developing abdominal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable, and he will need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy with end ileostomy for toxic megacolon caused by Clostridioides difficile (CDiff) colitis. He has a past medical history of recent Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute renal failure (ARF). He presented with abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and leukocytosis one week after discharge and was found to have CDiff. He was treated with oral flagyl and vancomycin, but developed increasing abdominal distension and was taken to the operating room for a total colectomy.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) where he is being monitored for potential complications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. He is intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's recent history of NSTEMI and ARF increases his risk of developing hypovolemic shock, particularly if he becomes hypotensive.
2. Sepsis: The patient's CDiff infection and recent surgical procedure increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. He may require further respiratory support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and AS valve area of 0.8 increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent surgical procedure and CDiff infection increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus, abscesses, and perforation.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and intubation increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as pressure ulcers, respiratory failure, and sepsis.
7. Infection: The patient's recent surgical procedure and CDiff infection increase his risk of developing infections, such as surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory tract infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust his fluid management and vasopressor therapy as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his pain management and nutritional support as needed to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation and pain management as needed to prevent neurological complications.
5. Consider ordering additional diagnostic tests, such as a cardiac enzymes test and an electrocardiogram, to further evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.
6. Consider ordering additional diagnostic tests, such as a complete blood count and a blood culture, to further evaluate the patient's infection status.
7. Consider ordering additional diagnostic tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to further evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal status and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   77 y/o M s/p total colectomy s/p end ileostomy for toxic megacolon from
   cdiff colitis. Past hx significant for recent NSTEMI, AS 0.8 area.
   Developed hypotension with fever overnight requiring massive fluid
   resuscitation and pressors. HD improved since then.
   #Hypotension/fluid shifts:
   Likely due to infection vs inflammatory response post surgery.
   Pressor requirements improved overnight after fluid resuscitation and
   broad spectrum antibiotics.
   CVP improved from 0 to 10 this am.
   Follow U/o and attempt to keep > 30 cc/hr

   # Resp Failure:
   - Very comfortable on PS 5/5 this am. Abg pend.
   - Crackles may be due to [**Doctor Last Name 2**] or fluid overload, CVP 10, follow closely
   -  Keep intubated on PS till pressor requirement improves and pain is
   better controlled.
   - Increase fentanyl and wean versed to keep pain minimal and as awake
   as possible

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent total colectomy for toxic megacolon due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis. He has a significant past medical history of recent non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and atrial septal defect (AS). The patient developed hypotension with fever overnight, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressors. His central venous pressure (CVP) improved from 0 to 10 mmHg since the morning. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. He is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 268 suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and AS may increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ARF and increased creatinine levels suggest that he may be at risk for further renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's C. diff colitis and recent surgery increase his risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's massive fluid resuscitation and increased CVP suggest that he may be at risk for fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema, which may be due to pneumonia or fluid overload.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent surgery and C. diff colitis may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o M with recent sigmoid colectomy [**2125-5-25**] in setting recurrent
   diverticulitis post op course c/b NSTEMI, ARF now admitted [**6-4**] with
   abdominal pain found to have pancolitis on CT scan of pelvis and
   subsequent clostridium difficile toxin A and B positive which has been
   difficult to manage on PO vancomycin with increasing large bowel
   distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical
   intervention [**2125-6-16**] with total colectomy and end ileostomy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy due to severe pancolitis and toxic megacolon caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A and B positivity. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and CAD with recent CABG. He is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 97% and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500-600 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin level. His renal function is normal, and his electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes recurrent diverticulitis, NSTEMI, ARF, and CAD with recent CABG. He has a history of severe aortic stenosis and is at risk for flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his history of CAD and recent CABG.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and ARF, and is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and is at risk for further infection due to his immunosuppressed state.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of severe pancolitis and toxic megacolon, and may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is normal, but he may be at risk for renal failure due to his history of ARF and his current fluid overload.
6. Sepsis: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and is at risk for sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state.
7. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and is at risk for flash pulmonary edema due to fluid overload.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy due to recurrent diverticulitis and toxic megacolon. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and CAD with CABG. Currently, he is in the ICU for post-operative management. He has a fever of 101.2°F, and his vital signs are stable. He is receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels. His imaging studies show pancolitis on CT scan of the pelvis. He is receiving IV fluids, and his ileostomy output is being monitored. He is at risk for complications such as flash pulmonary edema, toxic megacolon, and DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's history of severe AS and volume overload, he is at risk for developing flash pulmonary edema once his fluids mobilize.
2. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's current condition and history of recurrent diverticulitis make him at risk for developing toxic megacolon.
3. DVT: The patient's history of CAD and recent surgery make him at risk for developing DVT.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his underlying medical conditions and post-operative status.
5. Infection: The patient's current infection with C. difficile and his history of recurrent diverticulitis make him at risk for developing further infections.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and CAD make him at risk for developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of recurrent diverticulitis and toxic megacolon make him at risk for developing further gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and abscesses.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's history of ARF and current condition make him at risk for developing further renal failure.
9. Septic Shock: The patient's current infection and underlying medical conditions make him at risk for developing septic shock.
10. Death: The patient's underlying medical conditions and current condition make him at risk for mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy due to severe pancolitis and toxic megacolon caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A and B positivity. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and CAD with CABG. He is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative management.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C) with a current temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (104-124 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/57 mmHg (75-131/59-75 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (13-29 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. He has an endotracheal tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 22.6-27.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 514-384 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25-29.3 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's history of NSTEMI and CAD
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's recent surgery and the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin
* Renal failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the need for diuresis

The patient's care plan includes:

* NPO status
* IV fluids with lactated Ringer's solution at 150 cc/hr, titrated to urine output greater than 30 cc/hr
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole
* Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam
* Mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14-19 breaths per minute
* Monitoring of the patient's ileostomy output
* Wound care per surgical team
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a recent total colectomy due to recurrent diverticulitis and toxic megacolon. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and severe aortic stenosis. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and sedation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. He is mechanically ventilated and has a tracheostomy in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may indicate sepsis, which is a potential complication of his underlying infections and surgical procedures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a RSBI of 40, which may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of NSTEMI and severe aortic stenosis increases his risk of cardiovascular instability, particularly with fluid overload and hypertension.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent total colectomy and history of diverticulitis increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulants.
5. Infection: The patient's underlying infections, including C. difficile colitis, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase his risk of developing additional infections.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload, as evidenced by his increased urine output and decreased blood pressure, may lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for malnutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, including protein, calories, and electrolytes.

These potential complications require close monitoring and prompt management to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis and was found to have pancolitis on CT scan of the pelvis. He was diagnosed with clostridium difficile toxin A and B positive and has been difficult to manage on PO vancomycin with increasing large bowel distension, requiring surgical intervention with total colectomy and end ileostomy. The patient has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and severe aortic stenosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, pancolitis, and clostridium difficile colitis.

24-Hour Events:

* The patient did not extubate as he was still on pressors.
* He had frequent PACs on tele and 12-lead, which improved after changing from levophed to neosynephrine.
* The patient had good urine output throughout the day.
* A plan for SBT was made.
* The patient received 1 unit of PRBCs for a Hct of 23.0 and may require a second unit given his recent NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's large bowel distension is concerning for toxic megacolon, which requires surgical intervention.
2. Clostridium difficile Colitis: The patient has a severe case of clostridium difficile colitis, which is difficult to manage and requires IV flagyl and monitoring of ileostomy output.
3. Post-Operative Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and severe aortic stenosis, which increases his risk for post-operative complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and sepsis.
4. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and recent NSTEMI make him at risk for flash pulmonary edema once his fluids mobilize.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis given his recent surgery, NSTEMI, and clostridium difficile colitis.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a RSBI of 14, which may indicate respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and severe aortic stenosis increase his risk for cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's ileostomy output and adjust IV fluids and antibiotics as necessary.
2. Consider switching to PCA for pain control.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation if his RSBI improves.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Consider adding diuresis to the patient's IV fluids to manage fluid overload.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as necessary.
8. Consider adding a statin to the patient's medication regimen to manage his recent NSTEMI."

   difficult to manage on PO vancomycin with increasing large bowel
   distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical
   intervention [**2125-6-16**] with total colectomy and end ileostomy.
   # Hemodynamics in the setting of critical AS: Very difficult  to manage
   in the setting of critical AS.  Currently 8L positive with CVPs and UOP
   at goal, in pulmonary edema, requiring pressors to maintain MAPS.
   Having ectopy on levophed with tachycardia which caused hemodynamic
   instability, and was switched to phenylephrine overnight.   Would
   prefer to avoid alpha agonists in the setting of AS
   -cardiology consult re: appropriate pressor in this setting- Possibly
   dobutamine to avoid alpha agonism?
   -continue current pressor management for now as he is hemodynamically
   stable with excellent oxygenation
   -Holding fluids as he is volume overloaded, will closely  monitor UOP
   and CVP using these as our parameters (>30cc/hr and [**9-4**] respectively)
   # Post operative management
   -Holding IVF for now as he is in pulmonary edema,
   -d/c all abx except for flagyl as he has completed 24hrs
   - pain control- will increase fentanyl gtt and decrease versed with
   plans to switch over to PCA
   - monitor ileostomy output
   - wound care per surgical team
   # Respiratory: currently on PSV 5/5 with recent gas 7.34/47/124, RISBI
   14, RR only 7 today
   -Will add a manditory RR
   -oxygenation and ventilation excellent despite pulmonary edema.
   -Closely monitor ABGs and change prn
   # C. diff colitis
   - IV flagyl
   # CAD s/p CABG
   - statin when taking POs
   - hold off ASA/BB/ACEi for now, needs to have BB added once BP allows
   given his recent NSTEMI, ECG with no acute ST-T wave changes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 77 y/o M with recent sigmoid colectomy [**2125-5-25**] in
   setting recurrent diverticulitis post op course c/b NSTEMI, ARF now
   admitted [**6-4**] with abdominal pain found to have pancolitis on CT scan
   of pelvis and subsequent clostridium difficile toxin A and B positive
   which has been difficult to manage on PO vancomycin with increasing
   large bowel distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring
   surgical intervention [**2125-6-16**] with total colectomy and end ileostomy.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Did not extubate as still on pressors in PM.
   - Having frequent PAC's on tele and on 12 lead - changed to
   neosynephrine from levophed, and HR/ectopy improved thereafter,
   otherwise weaning neosynephrine overnight.  Off pressors this AM.
   - UOP good throughout most of day
   - Plan for SBT this AM.
   - Transfused 1 unit PRBC's this AM for Hct of 23.0, will likely need
   2nd unit given recent NSTEMI, but given plan for extubation this AM did
   not want to overly fluid challenge.

   distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical
   intervention [**2125-6-16**] with total colectomy and end ileostomy.
   # Hemodynamics in the setting of critical AS: Very difficult  to manage
   in the setting of critical AS.  Currently 8L positive with CVPs and UOP
   at goal, in pulmonary edema, requiring pressors to maintain MAPS.
   Having ectopy on levophed with tachycardia which caused hemodynamic
   instability, and was switched to phenylephrine overnight.   Would
   prefer to avoid alpha agonists in the setting of AS
   -cardiology consult re: appropriate pressor in this setting- Possibly
   dobutamine to avoid alpha agonism?
   -continue current pressor management for now as he is hemodynamically
   stable with excellent oxygenation
   -Holding fluids as he is volume overloaded, will closely  monitor UOP
   and CVP using these as our parameters (>30cc/hr and [**9-4**] respectively)
   # Post operative management
   -Holding IVF for now as he is in pulmonary edema,
   -d/c all abx except for flagyl as he has completed 24hrs
   - pain control- will increase fentanyl gtt and decrease versed with
   plans to switch over to PCA
   - monitor ileostomy output
   - wound care per surgical team
   # Respiratory: currently on PSV 5/5 with recent gas 7.34/47/124, RISBI
   14, RR only 7 today
   -Will add a manditory RR
   -oxygenation and ventilation excellent despite pulmonary edema.
   -Closely monitor ABGs and change prn
   # C. diff colitis
   - IV flagyl
   # CAD s/p CABG
   - statin when taking POs
   - hold off ASA/BB/ACEi for now, needs to have BB added once BP allows
   given his recent NSTEMI, ECG with no acute ST-T wave changes

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis and developed pancolitis, which was managed with PO vancomycin but led to large bowel distension and concern for toxic megacolon. He was subsequently treated with total colectomy and end ileostomy.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to post-operative complications, including:

1. Hemodynamic instability: He is on pressors, including levophed and neosynephrine, to maintain MAPs, and has had ectopy and tachycardia.
2. Respiratory failure: He is on PSV/SBT ventilation with a recent ABG showing pH 7.34, PaCO2 47, and PaO2 124.
3. Abdominal distension: He has had increasing large bowel distension, which has been managed with IV flagyl, and has undergone total colectomy and end ileostomy.
4. Cardiac complications: He has had a recent NSTEMI and is on prophylactic heparin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Continued use of pressors may lead to alpha agonism, which could worsen his cardiac condition.
2. Respiratory failure: Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to his pulmonary edema and respiratory acidosis.
3. Abdominal complications: Toxic megacolon may have been avoided, but the patient is still at risk for further complications, such as peritonitis or abscess formation.
4. Cardiac complications: His recent NSTEMI and cardiac history make him susceptible to further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is at risk for developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
6. Fluid overload: The patient is volume overloaded and at risk for further fluid accumulation, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiac status.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient has been NPO and is at risk for nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein and caloric deficiencies.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in his condition, and his treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly. This may include:

1. Continuing pressor therapy with close monitoring of his hemodynamic status.
2. Weaning from mechanical ventilation and monitoring his respiratory status.
3. Managing his abdominal distension and potential complications.
4. Monitoring his cardiac status and adjusting his treatment plan as necessary.
5. Ensuring adequate nutrition and glycemic control.
6. Preventing further fluid overload and infection.
7. Considering the use of dobutamine as an alternative pressor to avoid alpha agonism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy with end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon from cdiff colitis. He has a significant past medical history, including recent NSTEMI and AS 0.8 area. He developed hypotension and fever overnight, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressors. His condition has improved since then, with a CVP improved from 0 to 10 this morning. He is currently intubated and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. His pain is being managed with fentanyl and versed, and he is scheduled to have a PCA pump started.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Fluid Shifts: The patient's hypotension may be due to infection and inflammatory response post-surgery. Close monitoring of his CVP and fluid status is essential to prevent further fluid shifts.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with crackles in his lungs and a high respiratory rate. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but his condition needs close monitoring to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and AS 0.8 area put him at risk for cardiac complications. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is essential, and he should be restarted on statin therapy as soon as possible.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's cdiff colitis and recent surgery put him at risk for infectious complications. Close monitoring of his wound and blood cultures is essential to prevent sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent surgery and cdiff colitis put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and intubation put him at risk for neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.
7. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient's recent surgery and immobility put him at risk for thromboembolic complications, such as DVT or PE.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's CVP and fluid status closely to prevent further fluid shifts.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his mechanical ventilation settings as necessary.
3. Restart the patient on statin therapy as soon as possible.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and blood cultures closely to prevent sepsis.
5. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis to the patient's medication regimen.
6. Consider adding a DVT prophylaxis to the patient's medication regimen.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his sedation and analgesia as necessary.
8. Consider adding a VAP prophylaxis to the patient's medication regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy for toxic megacolon caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis. He has a past history of recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient developed hypotension with fever overnight after surgery, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressors. He was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and is currently intubated and sedated.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's recent NSTEMI, AS, and critical AS may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
3. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's C. diff colitis may not be fully eradicated, and he may develop secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's end ileostomy may lead to complications, such as bowel obstruction, fistula, or perforation.
6. **Hematological Complications:** The patient's low hemoglobin level and recent blood transfusion may increase his risk of bleeding or anemia.
7. **Renal Complications:** The patient's fluid overload and pulmonary edema may worsen his kidney function, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
8. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's inability to eat and potential need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to malnutrition and related complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamics, and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust pressors and fluids as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
3. Consult with cardiology to optimize management of the patient's critical AS and recent NSTEMI.
4. Consider antibiotic therapy to prevent secondary infections and manage C. diff colitis.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and manage any potential complications related to the end ileostomy.
6. Consider transfusing blood products as needed to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
7. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust fluid management accordingly to prevent AKI or CKD.
8. Consult with a nutritionist to optimize the patient's nutritional status and manage any potential complications related to TPN."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: s/p total colectomy for monitoring
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   77  M with hx of diverticulitis s/p sigmoid colectomy complicated by
   NSTEMI and ARF. Found to have cdiff toxic megacolon. Went for total
   colectomy with end ileostomy [**6-16**]. Tolerated surgery well. Developed
   SIRS vs infection post op.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2125-6-17**] 04:05 PM
   Dropped MAPs with Levophed and Vasopressin weans yesterday. Got fluid
   for resuscitation and maintained good CVP and UO. Was getting PACs with
   runs and  tachycardia on Levophed and Vasopressin in the setting of a
   recent MI. D/w surgery and switched to neosynephrine. Was getting
   fluids continuously to keep up CVP and UO. HR and arrythmia improved on
   neosynephrine. EKG with PACs but no signs of ischemia. CXR shows
   pulmonary edema. Cardiology consult requested for HD management.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy with end ileostomy due to toxic megacolon caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis. He has a history of recent non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute respiratory failure. The patient developed hypotension with fever overnight after surgery, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressors. He was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, which is concerning given his known critical aortic stenosis (AS).

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 93/82 mmHg and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg
* Receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O
* Has a distended abdomen with a pink end ileostomy and brown stool
* Has a history of C. diff colitis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Has a history of NSTEMI and AS, and is being treated with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins as needed

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/fluid shifts: The patient's hypotension may be due to infection, inflammatory response, or fluid shifts. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics have improved his pressor requirements, but he may still require close monitoring and management.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to his underlying critical AS, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, and the patient may require further evaluation and management.
3. Infectious disease: The patient's C. diff colitis may not be fully treated, and he may require further antibiotic therapy. He is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and AS puts him at risk for cardiac complications, including acute decompensated heart failure. He may require further evaluation and management by cardiology.
5. Abdominal complications: The patient's distended abdomen and end ileostomy may be at risk for complications, including perforation, abscess, or obstruction. He may require further evaluation and management by surgery.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics, including blood pressure, CVP, and cardiac output.
2. Continue mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
3. Consider further antibiotic therapy for C. diff colitis, and monitor for signs of treatment failure.
4. Consider further evaluation and management by cardiology for cardiac complications.
5. Consider further evaluation and management by surgery for abdominal complications.
6. Monitor for signs of VAP and other infections, and consider further antibiotic therapy if necessary.
7. Consider weaning from the ventilator in the future, but only if the patient's hemodynamics and respiratory status improve."

   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  At 1AM, CVP dipped to 7,  so I shut off the
   lasix gtt.  MAPs stayed stable.
   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt if it continues to drop off (??)
   -We started TPN as the patient has been NPO for a long time and has a
   low albumin likely contributing to his edema.  Got a pre-mixed standard

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  At 1AM, CVP dipped to 7,  so I shut off the
   lasix gtt.  MAPs stayed stable.
   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt if it continues to drop off (??)
   -We started TPN as the patient has been NPO for a long time and has a
   low albumin likely contributing to his edema.  Got a pre-mixed standard
   over ~18hrs
   -12 hour rule out with cardiac enzymes per cards recs negative
   -PM HCT came back 22, surgery did not want any transfusion

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy and end ileostomy due to recurrent diverticulitis and toxic megacolon. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and CAD with CABG. Currently, he is in the ICU for management of abdominal pain, pancolitis, and C. difficile colitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/52 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's hemodynamics are being managed with pressors, currently levophed with lasix, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is at goal. He is also receiving TPN and IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL. His white blood cell count is 17.1 K/uL, and his platelet count is 308 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is receiving IV antibiotics, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and CAD with CABG, which increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, which indicates kidney injury, and his BUN level is 27 mg/dL, which may indicate worsening kidney function.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a recent surgical wound, which increases the risk of wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure his optimal care."

   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  Patient started on lasix gtt however at At
   1AM, CVP dropped to 7 and lasix was d/ced for the remainder of the
   night. MAPs stayed stable.
   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt however ---total I/Os approximately even over
   last 24 hrs
   -Started TPN as the patient has been NPO for a long time and has a low
   albumin likely contributing to his edema.  Got a pre-mixed standard
   over ~18hrs

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o M with critical AS, recent sigmoid colectomy [**2125-5-25**] [**2-24**]
   recurrent diverticulitis post op course c/b NSTEMI, ARF, re-admitted
   [**6-4**] with abdominal pain found to have pancolitis on CT and positive
   clostridium difficile toxin A and B , subsequent increasing large bowel
   distension concerning for toxic megacolon requiring surgical resection
   [**2125-6-16**] with total colectomy and end ileostomy now with significant
   volume overload in setting of critical AS.
   # Volume Overload. In setting of AS and pulmonary edema, low BP this
   has been difficult to manage. Patient was on pressors o/n, d/ced due to
   stable MAPs. Have been attempting gentle diuresis with lasix gtt. CVP
   have been labile and as low as 7 therefore lasix gtt held in early AM.
   - continue gentle diuresis as MAP and CVP tolerate
   - f/up cardiology recs
   - UOP and CVP golas >30cc/hr and [**9-4**] respectively
    # Critical AS. Patient sustained NSTEMI (CK peak 286), currently
   anemic with Hct 22.
   -          would consider blood transfusion to prevent recurrent
   ischemia and to assist with intravascular volume/limit thrid spacing
   -          currently on no other cardiovascular medications
   -          f/up card recs
   # Hypotension. Currently off pressors, I/Os approximately even. No
   evidence of sepsis. Currently on broad coverage with vanco/zosyn,
   consider d/c today.
   -          continue to monitor MAP, UOP, CVP
   -          restart phenylephrine as a pressor given ectopy on
   norepinephrine.
   # s/p total colectomy. Currently stable. F/up surgery recs, started TPN
   for nutrition.
   - continue Flagyl
   - pain control- will increase fentanyl gtt for now
   - monitor ileostomy output
   - wound care per surgical team
   # Respiratory: currently on AC 500/14/5/40%. ABG this AM 7.38/49/124.
   Consider PS trial today given elevated O2.
   # C. diff colitis. Cont Flagyl IV.
   # CAD s/p CABG
   - statin when taking POs
   - hold off ASA/BB/ACEi for now, needs to have BB added once BP allows
   given his recent NSTEMI, ECG with no acute ST-T wave changes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including critical aortic stenosis (AS), recent sigmoid colectomy, and recurrent diverticulitis. He was readmitted with abdominal pain, pancolitis, and positive Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, leading to a total colectomy and end ileostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU with significant volume overload, pulmonary edema, and anemia.

Key findings:

* The patient's CVP has been labile, dropping to 7 mmHg, and lasix gtt was held due to concerns about further volume depletion.
* The patient has been off pressors since 10 PM, with stable MAPs.
* UOP has been decreasing, with a last hour of 20cc, and surgery wants to restart the lasix gtt.
* The patient has a low albumin, likely contributing to his edema.
* The patient has a history of NSTEMI, with a peak CK of 286, and is currently anemic with a Hct of 22.
* The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being considered for discharge from antibiotics.

Potential medical complications:

1. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload is a concern, particularly in the setting of critical AS and pulmonary edema. Further fluid management is needed to prevent further volume overload and cardiac compromise.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, particularly in the setting of critical AS and NSTEMI. Blood transfusion may be necessary to prevent recurrent ischemia and to assist with intravascular volume and limit third spacing.
3. Sepsis: The patient's broad-spectrum antibiotics and positive C. difficile toxin A and B suggest that sepsis is a possibility. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, is essential.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, particularly with his history of NSTEMI and critical AS. Further monitoring of his respiratory status, including ABG analysis, is necessary to ensure that he is not developing respiratory compromise.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of NSTEMI and critical AS makes him at risk for cardiovascular instability. Monitoring of his cardiovascular status, including his MAP, CVP, and cardiac enzymes, is essential to ensure that he is not developing further cardiovascular instability."

   24 Hour Events:
   -Cardiology was consulted for help with pressors, they recommended
   levophed with lasix gtt.  Patient started on lasix gtt however at At
   1AM, CVP dropped to 7 and lasix was d/ced for the remainder of the
   night. MAPs stayed stable.
   -Has been off the levophed since 10PM with MAPs at goal.
   -UOP has been decreasing, last hour 20cc, surgery would like us to
   restart the lasix gtt however ---total I/Os approximately even over
   last 24 hrs
   -Started TPN as the patient has been NPO for a long time and has a low

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), recent sigmoid colectomy, and a history of recurrent diverticulitis, NSTEMI, and ARF. He was re-admitted with abdominal pain and was found to have pancolitis on CT and positive Clostridium difficile toxin A and B. He underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy, and is now experiencing significant volume overload in the setting of critical AS.

The patient has been on pressors overnight, but they were discontinued due to stable mean arterial pressures (MAPs). He has been attempting gentle diuresis with lasix gtt, but the central venous pressure (CVP) has been labile and as low as 7, so the lasix gtt was held in the early morning.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.2°C, HR: 81 bpm, BP: 104/52 mmHg, RR: 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP: 12 mmHg, MAP: 104 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total I/Os: 3,738 mL, total out: 3,380 mL, urine output: 3,150 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device: endotracheal tube, ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, Vt: 500 mL, PEEP: 5 cmH2O, FiO2: 40%
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 17.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 22.1%
	+ Plt: 308 K/uL
	+ Cr: 1.0 mg/dL
	+ TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
	+ TCO2: 26 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 104 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/32.3/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 37/3/<0.01, differential-neuts: 92.0%, band: 2.0%, lymph: 4.0%, mono: 1.0%, eos: 0.0%, lactic acid: 0.5 mmol/L, Ca++: 7.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Volume overload and cardiac failure due to critical AS
* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and potential toxic megacolon
* Sepsis or septic shock due to Clostridium difficile colitis or other infections
* Acute kidney injury or failure due to volume overload and potential toxic megacolon
* Cardiovascular instability due to recent NSTEMI and ARF
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to pancolitis and potential toxic megacolon
* Wound infection or dehiscence due to recent surgery
* Respiratory failure due to potential respiratory muscle weakness or diaphragmatic paralysis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue gentle diuresis as MAP and CVP tolerate
* Follow-up with cardiology recommendations
* Monitor MAP, UOP, and CVP in setting of diuresis
* Restart phenylephrine as a pressor given ectopy on norepinephrine
* Continue IV Flagyl for C. difficile colitis
* Monitor ileostomy output and wound care per surgical team
* Restart ASA per cardiology recommendations
* Consider PS trial today given elevated O2
* Hold off BB/ACEi for now, needs to have BB added once BP allows given recent NSTEMI, ECG with no acute ST-T wave changes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Platelet count (Plt) 280 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid 0.5 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++) 7.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++) 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4) 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Severe AS with a valve area <0.8 cm²
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL
* C. diff colitis
* Recurrent diverticulitis
* NSTEMI
* ARF

The patient's medications include:

* Fentanyl for pain management
* Lasix drip for diuresis
* TPN for nutrition
* Flagyl IV for C. diff colitis
* ASA for cardiac medication
* Statin for cardiac medication
* Beta blocker for cardiac medication

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Volume overload and cardiac failure due to severe AS
* Recurrent ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias due to anemia and NSTEMI
* Sepsis and septic shock due to C. diff colitis
* Wound infection and dehiscence due to total colectomy and end ileostomy
* Respiratory failure due to weaning from mechanical ventilation
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to C. diff colitis and anemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing gentle diuresis and monitoring of MAP and CVP
* Restarting ASA and statin medications
* Weaning sedation and evaluating mental status for extubation
* Monitoring ileostomy output and wound care
* Continuing IV Flagyl for C. diff colitis
* Following up with cardiology and surgery teams for further recommendations."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and has a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent sigmoid colectomy, recurrent diverticulitis, and NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU due to severe AS, anemia, and volume overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via an endotracheal tube and is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9.7 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with a alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 150 mg/dL and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 100 mg/dL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 32 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient's AS is severe, with a valve area less than 0.8 cm^2. This can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and decreased perfusion of vital organs.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.7 g/dL, which is below the normal range. Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Volume overload: The patient has a history of volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and decreased cardiac output.
4. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis, which can lead to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and decreased perfusion of vital organs.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's severe AS and history of NSTEMI make them at risk for cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's volume overload and history of C. diff colitis make them at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of C. diff colitis and anemia make them at risk for sepsis.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's volume overload and history of NSTEMI make them at risk for kidney injury.
5. Wound infection: The patient's wound site is at risk for infection, particularly with C. diff.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued gentle diuresis to manage volume overload.
2. Blood transfusion to prevent recurrent ischemia and to assist with intravascular volume and limit third spacing.
3. Restart of aspirin per cardiology recommendations.
4. Weaning of sedation to evaluate mental status further prior to plan for extubation.
5. Continued IV Flagyl for C. diff colitis.
6. Wound care per surgery team.
7. Monitoring of ileostomy output.
8. Nutrition with TPN without lipids.

The patient's condition is stable, but they are at risk for medical complications. Close monitoring and management of their condition are necessary to prevent complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a total colectomy and end ileostomy due to recurrent diverticulitis, pancolitis, and severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He has been in the ICU for 4 days and has been tolerating diuresis well, but still has a severe volume overload. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Wound infection: The patient's wound is slightly erythematous and oozing, which may indicate the presence of an infection. Close monitoring and wound care are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's C. diff colitis and wound infection increase his risk of developing sepsis. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, is essential.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and adjustments to his ventilation settings are necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Volume overload: The patient's severe volume overload increases his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of his fluid status and diuresis are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may exacerbate his respiratory and cardiac status. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary to improve his oxygenation and cardiac function.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of his platelet count and transfusion of platelets may be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of his liver function and treatment of underlying causes, such as sepsis or C. diff colitis, are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and is currently in the ICU due to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), recent sigmoid colectomy, and recurrent diverticulitis. He has a history of NSTEMI, ARF, and re-admission with abdominal pain. He was found to have pancolitis on CT and positive Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, leading to a total colectomy and end ileostomy.

The patient is currently being treated for volume overload, with a goal of negative 2-3 liters today. His CVP has decreased to 4, but he has significant peripheral edema. He is being ventilated and is being restarted on lasix drip at 5mg/hr.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a plan to extubate him in the morning. His cardiac status is stable, with a valve area of 0.8cm and tolerating diuresis well.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.2-7.9
* Hct: 28.8-31.1
* Plt: 356-338
* Cr: 0.7-0.8

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Volume overload: The patient is currently being treated for volume overload, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and increased risk of infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is being ventilated, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is being treated for volume overload, which can increase the risk of cardiac failure.
* Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is being treated with flagyl, which can increase the risk of infection.
* Wound complications: The patient had a total colectomy and end ileostomy, which can increase the risk of wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, and bleeding.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving TPN, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of recurrent diverticulitis and is currently being treated for C. difficile colitis, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, it is recommended that he be closely monitored and managed in the ICU to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with critical aortic stenosis, recent sigmoid colectomy, and a history of recurrent diverticulitis, NSTEMI, and ARF. He was re-admitted with abdominal pain and found to have pancolitis on CT and positive Clostridium difficile toxin A and B. He underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy due to severe AS and volume overload. The patient is currently receiving diuresis with lasix, and his vital signs are stable. He is experiencing abdominal pain at the incision site, which is being managed with IV morphine. He is also receiving antibiotics for C. diff colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Volume Overload: The patient's current positive fluid balance and increasing abdominal distension may lead to further volume overload, which can exacerbate his cardiac and respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severe AS and history of NSTEMI increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to his cardiac condition, abdominal distension, and potential respiratory infections.
4. Sepsis: The patient's C. diff colitis and abdominal pain increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Wound Complications: The patient's abdominal wound may become infected or develop complications, such as dehiscence or evisceration, due to his underlying medical conditions and surgical procedures.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to his gastrointestinal surgery and potential malabsorption, which can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
7. Medication-Related Complications: The patient's medication regimen, including diuretics, beta blockers, and antibiotics, may cause adverse effects, such as electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or allergic reactions.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address these potential complications and ensure his optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg. He has a mild pain score of 3/27 and is receiving pain medication. His respiratory status has improved, with no signs of respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Wound infection: The patient's wound is at risk for infection, especially since he has a history of C. diff colitis. Close monitoring of the wound and administration of antibiotics as needed are crucial.
2. Volume overload: The patient has been receiving fluids and may be at risk for volume overload. Monitoring of his fluid status and diuresis is necessary to prevent complications.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which increases his risk for cardiac complications. Rate control and optimization of his cardiac medication are essential.
4. Coronary disease: The patient has a history of coronary disease and recent NSTEMI. Close monitoring of his cardiac status and optimization of his medication are necessary.
5. C. diff colitis: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis, which may recur. Close monitoring of his stool and administration of antibiotics as needed are crucial.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving TPN without lipids, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly monitored.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness. Prophylaxis with histamine-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may be necessary.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to his immobility and critical illness. Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin may be necessary.
9. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his critical illness and potential infections. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

He underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy, and is currently being managed for volume overload in the setting of severe AS.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his peripheral vascular examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 338 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. His liver enzymes are elevated, and his lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and vancomycin (completed). He is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Volume overload: The patient is at risk of developing volume overload due to his ongoing positive fluid balance and the need for continued diuresis.
2. Heart failure: The patient's severe AS and history of NSTEMI put him at risk of developing heart failure.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's ARF and ongoing positive fluid balance increase his risk of developing further kidney injury.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient's ongoing treatment with Flagyl IV for 7 days post-vancomycin increases his risk of developing further Clostridium difficile colitis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's positive fluid balance, ongoing infection, and immunosuppressed state increase his risk of developing sepsis.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing positive fluid balance and history of ARF increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent colectomy and ongoing treatment with Flagyl IV increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

In conclusion, the patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his volume overload, heart failure, kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He should also be monitored for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal complications."
