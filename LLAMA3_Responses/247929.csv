   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT: 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who
   presents with dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF
   15-20%.
   PLAN:
   .
   CHF, systolic, new diagnosis:  Stable.  Patient's BPs when she reached
   the CCU was 60-80s systolic.  On exam, patient's lungs are CTAB, 12 cm
   JVD, cool extremities, c/w cardiogenic shock.  Patient's BPs have been
   low, likely compounded with AFib with RVR.
   - Will start Dobutamine gtt with goal SBP > 100
   - Will diurese patient once SBPs are consistently above 90.
   AFib with RVR, new diagnosis:  Patient's rates have been poorly
   controlled, likely exacerbating CHF.  Pt given several doses of dilt
   and metoprolol for control, BP has dropped.  For now, will continue
   with positive inotropic [**Doctor Last Name **].  Demand likely etiology of elevation
   (mild) in trops.
   - Defer rate control, start amio gtt if needed.
   - Start heparin IV gtt
   - Continue ASA 325mg
   .
   Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis:  Unclear etiology.  Given that
   patient has clear lungs, but is in heart failure, likely that this is a
   chronic process.  Pt had cath in [**5-14**] that was normal, performed
   because patient had CP during exercise MIBI (normal) and hypotension.
   EF at that time was > 55%.  Differential includes viral, metabolic,
   hemachromatosis, idiopathic.  Echo did not show evidence of amyloid.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident who presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation, and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction of 15-20%.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F) with a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute with a normal range of 92-115 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 95/77 mmHg with a normal range of 70-133 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute with a normal range of 18-25 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient has a number of laboratory results, including:

* White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 34.1%
* Platelet count: 235 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 213 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition is considered stable, but the patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is at risk for cardiogenic shock.

The patient is being treated with Dobutamine, a positive inotropic medication, and is being monitored for signs of cardiogenic shock. The patient is also being treated with heparin, an anticoagulant, and ASA 325mg, an antiplatelet medication.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

* Cardiogenic shock: This is a life-threatening condition that can occur when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The patient's low blood pressure and cool extremities are concerning signs of cardiogenic shock.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which is a sign of kidney damage. The patient's condition is likely prerenal, meaning that it is caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys rather than intrinsic kidney disease.
* Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture is positive, and the patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic.
* Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which is a sign of liver damage. The patient's condition is likely related to congestive hepatomegaly, or swelling of the liver.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, which is a sign of diabetes. The patient's condition is likely related to the patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2.
* Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. The patient's condition is likely related to the patient's use of diuretics.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which can cause dehydration, headache, and other symptoms. The patient's condition is likely related to the patient's use of diuretics.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's potential medical complications include cardiogenic shock, renal failure, urinary tract infection, transaminitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presents with dyspnea, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 95/77 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 106 bpm, and respiratory rate (RR) of 25 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%, and her hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 645 mL and output of 25 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient with no anisocoria, no carotid bruits, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her lungs are clear, and her abdomen is soft with normoactive bowel sounds. Her extremities show 1+ leg edema, and her skin is cool and dry.

Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.0 mg/dL, which is worse than admission, likely due to prerenal azotemia from poor forward flow and low SBPs. The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 1600 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 195 IU/L. The patient's HbA1C level is less than 6%, indicating good glycemic control.

The patient's diagnosis includes:

1. CHF, systolic, new diagnosis: The patient's BPs have improved to >90 systolic, and her LE temperatures have improved. The presentation is consistent with cardiogenic shock.
2. AFib with RVR, new diagnosis: The patient's rates have been poorly controlled, likely exacerbating CHF.
3. Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis: The patient's EF is 15-20%, and her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to viral, metabolic, hemachromatosis, or idiopathic causes.
4. ARF: The patient's Cr level has worsened, likely due to prerenal azotemia from poor forward flow and low SBPs.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's AST and ALT levels are elevated, which may be related to lab error or possible embolization or shock liver.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix gtt, titrated to keeping SBP >90.
2. Rate control with low-dose metoprolol.
3. Continue heparin IV gtt.
4. Continue ASA 325mg.
5. Monitor UOP and I/Os.
6. Hold oral meds and initiate ISS for DM2.
7. Replete lytes prn, IVF prn.
8. Prophylaxis: bowel regimen.
9. Code status: Full.
10. Dispo: CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's EF is 15-20%, which indicates significant cardiac dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 25 inspirations per minute, which may indicate respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient's Cr level has worsened, likely due to prerenal azotemia from poor forward flow and low SBPs.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are not well-controlled, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, which may indicate liver damage or infection.
6. Embolization: The patient's AST and ALT levels are elevated, which may indicate possible embolization or shock liver.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. Her laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 117 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg. She has a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F) and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (bpm). Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient has a diagnosis of chronic heart failure (CHF) with a systolic EF of 15-20%. She has also been diagnosed with AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and dilated cardiomyopathy. Her laboratory results show elevated liver function tests, creatinine, and troponin-T.

The patient's plan includes continuing carvedilol, lasix, and heparin gtt. She will also undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and possible cardioversion. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is to the coronary care unit (CCU).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with dyspnea for three days, AFib, and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20%. She has been in the ICU for several days and has had various medical issues, including CHF, systolic, ARF, and transaminitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg, heart rate of 117 bpm, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, as well as elevated creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals a dilated cardiomyopathy with an irregular heartbeat, distant heart sounds, and no murmurs or rubs. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normoactive bowel sounds.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing lasix to manage CHF and fluid balance
* Starting lisinopril to manage hypertension
* Starting amiodarone to manage AFib
* Continuing heparin IV gtt to prevent thrombosis
* Continuing ASA 325mg to prevent stroke
* Repleting electrolytes as needed
* Monitoring liver function tests and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Holding oral medications and initiating insulin sliding scale (ISS) for DM2
* Repleting lytes and IVF as needed
* Providing prophylaxis for bowel regimen and stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Hepatic complications, such as acute liver failure and chronic liver disease
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia
* Infections, such as sepsis and pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding
* Neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident who was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and has had one run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and creatinine, and the patient has been receiving lasix, carvedilol, and heparin infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg, heart rate of 117 bpm, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to further decompensation of heart failure, which could result in pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or even death.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia may lead to further arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which could result in cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and elevated creatinine levels may progress to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease, which could require dialysis or transplantation.
4. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and transaminases may indicate liver damage or failure, which could result in coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or even death.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, or catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism may increase the risk of thrombus formation, which could result in pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or even stroke.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and inability to eat may lead to malnutrition, which could result in impaired wound healing, increased risk of infection, or even death.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities make her a high-risk patient who requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who was admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She has a new diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. The patient's condition has been stabilized, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90s-120s, and she is receiving lasix drip and heparin infusion. However, the lasix drip was stopped due to the patient's systolic blood pressure dropping to the 80s.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Negative fluid balance of 3.6L in 24 hours, which may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Decreased creatinine (Cr) levels, which may be related to hypoperfusion.
3. Transaminitis, likely caused by hypotension and CHF.
4. Loose stool, which may be related to gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction.
5. Elevated troponin-T levels, indicating potential cardiac damage.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.1 g/dL
* White blood cell (WBC) count: 12.6-12.8 K/uL
* Platelet (Plt) count: 235-226 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.5-2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 33 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continuing heparin infusion and amiodarone-loading for AFib.
2. Stopping lasix drip due to hypotension.
3. Initiating lisinopril 5mg po daily for CHF.
4. Repleting electrolytes and IV fluids as needed.
5. Monitoring for signs of GI dysfunction and adjusting bowel regimen accordingly.
6. Holding oral medications for DM2 and initiating insulin sliding scale (ISS).
7. Repleting lytes and IVF as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
2. Sepsis, due to the patient's compromised immune system and potential GI dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure, due to the patient's CHF and potential respiratory compromise.
4. Renal failure, due to the patient's decreased Cr levels and potential hypoperfusion.
5. GI bleeding, due to the patient's loose stool and potential GI dysfunction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident who was admitted with dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. She failed cardioversion and is currently on amiodarone loading, heparin infusion, and aspirin. She has a negative fluid balance of 3.6L in 24 hours and has stopped lasix drip due to systolic blood pressure in the 80s. She also has diarrhea and stool has been sent for C. difficile testing. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105-130 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 84/59 mmHg. She has a weight loss of 3.3 kg since admission and has been receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen due to her dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, which can lead to further fluid accumulation and decreased cardiac output.
2. Sepsis: The patient's diarrhea and C. difficile testing may indicate a possible septic episode, which can lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending down, but she still has a baseline creatinine level of 0.8, which may indicate underlying renal impairment. Further monitoring of her renal function is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is in the 80s, which may indicate hypotension, especially in the context of heart failure. Further monitoring and treatment of her blood pressure is necessary.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, should be closely monitored due to her heart failure and potential use of diuretics.
6. Infection: The patient's recent catheterization and potential sepsis may indicate a high risk of infection, which should be closely monitored and treated promptly if necessary.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's weight loss and potential malnutrition may worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of complications. Nutritional support should be considered.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to her heart failure and potential respiratory compromise.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue treatment of her atrial fibrillation with amiodarone and heparin infusion.
3. Monitor her renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
4. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her electrolyte management accordingly.
5. Consider nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and improve her overall condition.
6. Monitor her respiratory status and provide respiratory support as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor for signs of infection and sepsis, and treat promptly if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis:  Unclear etiology.  Given that
   patient has clear lungs, but is in heart failure, likely that this is a
   chronic process.  Pt had cath in [**5-14**] that was normal, performed
   because patient had CP during exercise MIBI (normal) and hypotension.
   EF at that time was > 55%.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be made:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%.

The patient's current condition is:

* Heart failure with systolic dysfunction, new diagnosis
* AFib with rapid ventricular rate (RVR)
* Dilated cardiomyopathy, unclear etiology
* Acute kidney injury (ARF) with creatinine trending down to 1.5
* Transaminitis likely related to hypotension and heart failure
* GI symptoms with loose stool

The patient's current medications include:

* Amiodarone 400 mg PO TID
* Aspirin 325 mg PO daily
* Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily
* Fluoxetine 20/40 mg PO
* Pravastatin 20 mg PO daily
* Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 34.1%
* Platelet count: 235 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 33 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Start Lasix 80 mg IV
* Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily
* PO amiodarone-loading
* Restart carvedilol
* Continue heparin IV gtt
* Continue ASA 325 mg
* FU EBV, HIV, SPEP/UPEP serologies
* Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily
* I/Os, Cr
* FU LFTs, trending down as of yesterday
* FU CDiff studies
* Hold oral meds and initiate ISS
* Check FSBG, meds

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening heart failure with decreased cardiac output
* Increased risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation
* Progression of ARF to chronic kidney disease
* Development of liver dysfunction or failure
* Increased risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Hemorrhagic complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Malnutrition and impaired wound healing due to poor nutritional status

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
