   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with ALL s/p chemo and recent VRE bacteremia with VRE CNS
   infection with multiple admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] who is now being transferred
   to ICU s/p hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix, if hemodynamics improve
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE results
   - if needed will start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone, and now
   meropenem
   - Sputum for cx
   - adjust vent settings to decrease RR today, and try to reduce FIO2
   today
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: Not currently receiving active treatment. Prognosis poor.
   - appreciate oncology input
   - acyclovir and atovaquone for PPx
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN:  Will need OGT/NGT placement for po meds, starting tube feeds.
   .
   # Access:  Femoral line placed by IR [**4-12**], will try to change line
   other side today
   .
   # PPx:  famotidine, subQ heparin (at [**Hospital1 **] given recent increase in PTT)
   .
   # Comm:  son [**Name (NI) 6306**] aware of transfer to ICU
   .
   # Code:  per son [**Name (NI) 6306**]/HCP, would only pursue 30-60 sec of CPR. D/w ICU
   attg, made CPR not indicated beyond 30-60sec
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU pending further work-up

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   60yo woman with ALL s/p chemo and recent VRE bacteremia with VRE CNS
   infection with multiple admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] who is now being transferred
   to ICU s/p hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix, if hemodynamics improve
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE results
   - if needed will start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone, and now
   meropenem
   - Sputum for cx
   - adjust vent settings to decrease RR today, and try to reduce FIO2
   today
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.

   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs

   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today

   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has had multiple admissions to the hospital for treatment and has recently developed VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. She has been transferred to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 74/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a history of cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and is currently receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen due to her underlying cardiac condition and the use of vasopressors.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen due to her underlying immunocompromised state and the presence of VRE bacteremia.
3. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion-gap metabolic acidosis may worsen due to her underlying respiratory failure and the use of vasopressors.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen due to her underlying renal failure and the use of vasopressors.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to her underlying bleeding disorder and the use of anticoagulants.
6. VRE bacteremia: The patient's VRE bacteremia may worsen due to her underlying immunocompromised state and the presence of indwelling catheters.
7. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen due to her underlying chronic kidney disease and the use of vasopressors.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen due to her underlying thyroid disease and the use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Adjust the patient's treatment plan as necessary to address any potential medical complications.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if her condition worsens.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, as necessary.
5. Consider the use of antibiotics and antifungals to treat the patient's VRE bacteremia and sepsis.
6. Consider the use of diuretics and vasopressors to treat the patient's anion-gap metabolic acidosis and cardiogenic shock.
7. Consider the use of anticoagulants and platelet transfusions to treat the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding disorder.
8. Consider the use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy to treat the patient's hypothyroidism."

   - Will likely need aline and is very hard stick. Will retry once
   rewarmed with baerhugger. Apparently has needed axillary aline before.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix. Given recent hypotension
   with elevated lactate to 14.4 and pressor requirement, will favor
   holding off for now. If hemodynamics improve, will start diuresis in
   AM.
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE.
   - Start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock --> pulm edema
   --> hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone. Adding
   meropenem.

   significant hyperkalemic cardiac changes on telemetry.
   - Check EKG.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with ALL s/p chemo and recent VRE bacteremia with VRE CNS
   infection with multiple admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] who is now being transferred
   to ICU s/p hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.
   - Will likely need aline and is very hard stick. Will retry once
   rewarmed with baerhugger. Apparently has needed axillary aline before.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix. Given recent hypotension
   with elevated lactate to 14.4 and pressor requirement, will favor
   holding off for now. If hemodynamics improve, will start diuresis in
   AM.
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE.
   - Start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock --> pulm edema
   --> hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone. Adding
   meropenem.
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line. Has significant evidence of
   hypoperfusion as has low urine output and very elevated lactate.
   Hypotension may also be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or
   septic shock would be more likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock.
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - IVF boluses (although evidence of pulm edema) to bump pt up on her
   Starling curve.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now.
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, doubt that pt would make
   any meaningful recovery and will rediscuss with son.
   - Levophed, dobutamine, IVFs as above to increase perfusion.
   - s/p 1 amp HCO3 and getting 3 additional amps of HCO3 with D5W now.
   - Follow serial pH and give HCO3 for pH < 7.2
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65.
   - maintain MAP > 65
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.
   - s/p HCO3 amps as above.
   - Give PR kayexalate.
   - Consider IV calcium for cardiac stabilization, thus far no
   significant hyperkalemic cardiac changes on telemetry.
   - Check EKG.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - Check DIC labs.
   - If fibrinogen low, will transfuse with cryoprecipitate and hold on
   plt transfusions.
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis. She has a history of VRE bacteremia and CNS infection, and is currently being treated with linezolid, acyclovir, and atovaquone. Her vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 74/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* White blood cell count: 12.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 116 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 9.8 mmol/L

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely due to severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock
* Cardiogenic shock: likely due to cardiomyopathy and/or sepsis
* Sepsis: likely due to VRE bacteremia and CNS infection
* Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: likely due to lactate production and decreased perfusion
* Hyperkalemia: likely due to increased cell death and metabolic acidosis
* Coagulopathy: likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: likely due to infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**]
* Hyponatremia: likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
* Anemia: likely due to marrow suppression after recent chemotherapy
* Thrombocytopenia: likely due to marrow suppression after recent chemotherapy
* Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: likely due to chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Levophed and dobutamine infusions to support blood pressure and cardiac output
* Linezolid, acyclovir, and atovaquone antibiotics to treat VRE bacteremia and CNS infection
* HCO3 and potassium supplements to correct acidosis and hyperkalemia
* PR kayexalate to treat hyperkalemia
* IV calcium to treat hyperkalemia and cardiac instability
* Cryoprecipitate transfusion to treat coagulopathy
* IVF boluses to bump the patient up on her Starling curve
* Fluid restriction to 1L to treat hyponatremia
* Monitor serial lactates, pH, and electrolyte levels to adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with a history of leukemia, acute (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), shock, cardiogenic, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia other, alteration in nutrition, airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), impaired skin integrity, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm (86-122 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 74/47 mmHg (53-124/103 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Weight: 60 kg (admission weight: 61 kg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 116 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.28 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 9.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 775 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Norepinephrine: 0.05 mcg/kg/min
* Midazolam (Versed): 2 mg/hour
* Famotidine (Pepcid): [**2176-5-6**] 08:00 PM
* Sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (Amp): [**2176-5-6**] 08:00 PM

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow
* Vt (Set): 450 mL
* RR (Set): 27
* PEEP: 10 cmH2O
* FiO2: 50%

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the inability to assess certain areas, including the skin, peripheral vascular, and neurologic systems.

The patient's medical and family history is significant for leukemia, acute (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm), and the patient has undergone multiple transfusions.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiogenic shock
* Sepsis
* Cardiac dysrhythmia
* Hypotension
* Hypovolemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypophosphatemia
* Impaired skin integrity
* Airway compromise
* Aspiration risk
* Altered mental status
* Delirium
* Nutritional deficiencies
* Electrolyte imbalances

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support. The patient's medication regimen should be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed. Additionally, the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) should be carefully managed to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] in the setting of likely
   shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn).
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - mechanical ventilation
 wean
   - consider dobutamine gtt for MAP < 60
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, acyclovir
   - , and try to reduce FIO2 today
   a.       Wean  Fio2 first and then can later can consider go down on
   PEEP
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   # Comm:  son [**Name (NI) 6306**] aware of transfer to ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever

   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, coagulopathy, and VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. She has a history of ALL, s/p allo non-related SCT, s/p donor lymphocyte infusion, and s/p chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and is intubated on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are as follows: T: 36.8°C, HR: 94 bpm, BP: 105/62 mmHg, RR: 20 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 100%. Her physical examination is significant for anasarca, diminished radial and pedal pulses, and cool and peripherally vasoconstricted extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's TTE shows an EF of 25%, which may indicate cardiogenic shock. The patient's hypotension, cold extremities, and low urine output also suggest cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The patient's VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and recent high-grade VRE bacteremia may indicate septic shock.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to her underlying condition and may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be due to her anion gap metabolic acidosis and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is rising, which may indicate coagulopathy. This may worsen if not managed properly.
6. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient's VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated lactate and metabolic acidosis may indicate renal failure.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not managed properly.
9. Asthma: The patient's asthma may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes in her condition.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiogenic shock and septic shock with fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
3. Manage the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate and consider changing her antimicrobial coverage if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hyperkalemia and consider correcting it with potassium-binding resins or hemodialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider correcting it with FFP or platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's VRE bacteremia with antibiotics and consider changing her antimicrobial coverage if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider correcting any abnormalities with diuretics or dialysis if necessary.
8. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
9. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further management of her asthma."

   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary

   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix, if hemodynamics improve
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE results
   - if needed will start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone, and now
   meropenem
   - Sputum for cx
   - adjust vent settings to decrease RR today, and try to reduce FIO2
   today
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has been hospitalized for prolonged periods and has developed various medical complications. Currently, she is in the ICU for respiratory failure due to hypoxic respiratory failure and anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Her neurological status is sedated, and she is not assessed for movement or tone.

The patient has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including anion-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and coagulopathy. She has also developed VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and has had an infected Omaya removed.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Management of hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Management of anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient will continue to receive bicarbonate therapy and will be monitored for serial lactates to ensure that the acidosis is improving.
3. Management of hyperkalemia: The patient will be monitored for serial electrolytes and will receive thiamine therapy to help improve potassium levels.
4. Management of coagulopathy: The patient will be monitored for serial coagulation studies and will receive FFP for procedures as needed.
5. Management of VRE bacteremia: The patient will continue to receive linezolid therapy for 4 weeks, and will have repeat blood and urine cultures to monitor for bacterial growth.
6. Management of anemia: The patient will be transfused with packed red blood cells if her hemoglobin level falls below 25 g/dL.
7. Management of thrombocytopenia: The patient will be monitored for serial platelet counts and will receive platelet transfusions if her platelet count falls below 20,000/mm³.
8. Management of acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient will be monitored for serial echocardiograms to assess for worsening heart failure, and will receive therapy to manage possible cardiogenic shock.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and her current respiratory status.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient may develop cardiovascular instability due to her underlying heart disease and her current treatment.
3. Infection: The patient may develop infection due to her immunocompromised state and her current medical condition.
4. Bleeding: The patient may develop bleeding due to her coagulopathy and her current treatment.
5. Renal failure: The patient may develop renal failure due to her underlying kidney disease and her current treatment.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - will wean sedation today
   - mechanical ventilation
 decrease PS once less sedation
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**].
   - norepinephrine gtt, wean as tolerated
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Resolving with improved tissue
   perfusion. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with latex),
   will add PO
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and has been experiencing prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and is intubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 393 and a respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute. The patient's cardiac status is also critical, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% on TTE.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to severe acute on chronic CHF, LVEF 25%, and septic shock due to possible sources of infection, including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, and Klebsiella pneumonia.
2. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension/shock, but the differential diagnosis also includes linezolid side effects and thiamine deficiency.
3. Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): The patient has abnormal potassium levels likely due to acidosis/alkalosis, and the levels will need to be monitored and repleted as needed.
4. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient has VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and the patient has been treated with linezolid, which has been switched to daptomycin.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to SIADH, and the patient will need to be monitored serially for sodium levels and consider salt tabs.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, and the patient will need to be monitored for coagulation status and given FFP for procedures.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to chemo, malignancy, and acute blood loss from procedures, and the patient will need to be transfused for Hct < 25.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia due to chemo and malignancy, and the patient will need to be monitored for platelet levels and transfused for < 20.
9. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which is stable.
10.? Asthma: The patient has been given inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol, but it is unclear if this is an underlying diagnosis or if these medications were started during the patient's hospital course.
11. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is receiving IV levothyroxine.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning sedation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Treating possible cardiogenic and septic shock.
3. Monitoring lactate levels and anion gap metabolic acidosis.
4. Monitoring and repleting potassium levels.
5. Monitoring coagulation status and giving FFP for procedures.
6. Transfusing for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. Monitoring sodium levels and considering salt tabs.
8. Monitoring and adjusting medication for anxiety and asthma.
9. Monitoring thyroid function and adjusting medication as needed.
10. Continuing to monitor and manage the patient's VRE bacteremia and CNS involvement.

The patient's code status is DNR, and the patient's disposition is ICU this morning."

   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - mechanical ventilation
 wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic. Cardiogenic shock in the
   setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on
   TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w possible
   sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p R
   femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.
   - norepinephrine gtt, wean as tolerated
   - consider dobutamine/milrinone gtt if MAP < 60
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Resolving with improved tissue
   perfusion. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - thiamine IV as poor PO absorption
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - mechanical ventilation
 wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic. Cardiogenic shock in the
   setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on
   TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w possible
   sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p R
   femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.
   - norepinephrine gtt, wean as tolerated
   - consider dobutamine/milrinone gtt if MAP < 60
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Resolving with improved tissue
   perfusion. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - thiamine IV as poor PO absorption
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.

   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (2 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and septic shock. She has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which is currently being treated with daptomycin. She has also developed anion-gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to tissue hypoperfusion. She has abnormal potassium levels, which may be related to acidosis or alkalosis. She has hyponatremia, which is likely due to SIADH. She has a coagulopathy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are all likely related to her chemotherapy and malignancy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if her underlying condition does not improve.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% and is at risk of further cardiac compromise if her cardiogenic shock is not managed effectively.
3. Septic shock: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which increases her risk of septic shock.
4. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion-gap metabolic acidosis may worsen if her underlying condition does not improve, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's abnormal potassium levels may worsen if her acidosis or alkalosis is not managed effectively, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if her SIADH is not managed effectively, which could lead to seizures, coma, and other complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if her INR is not monitored and managed effectively, which could lead to bleeding complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her underlying condition does not improve, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac compromise and respiratory failure.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if her underlying condition does not improve, which could lead to bleeding complications.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which increases her risk of further infection and septic shock."

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 66.
   - mechanical ventilation
 SBT today
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), donor lymphocyte infusion, and chemotherapy. She has a poor prognosis.
* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock.
* She has a prolonged hospitalization course, with multiple admissions to the ICU, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
* The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which was treated with linezolid, and has now been switched to daptomycin.
* She has also had a Klebsiella pneumonia infection and has been treated with meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and atovaquone.
* The patient has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hyponatremia, which are likely related to her underlying malignancy, chemotherapy, and acute blood loss.
* She has a high risk of developing further complications, including septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and multi-organ failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
* Development of septic shock or cardiogenic shock, which could lead to multi-organ failure and increased mortality
* Progression of VRE bacteremia to other organs, such as the kidneys, liver, or spleen
* Development of acute kidney injury or acute liver failure, which could worsen the patient's prognosis
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Development of further electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which could worsen the patient's cardiac function and increase the risk of arrhythmias
* Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.

Based on this information, I recommend that the patient's care team continue to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and that they consider the following:

* Continuing broad antimicrobial coverage to prevent further infection
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory function and adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings as necessary
* Managing the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy
* Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and adjusting her fluid and electrolyte management accordingly
* Considering the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis to prevent further complications
* Discussing the patient's code status and advance care planning with her and her family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - mechanical ventilation
 decrease PS, daily SBTs
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**].
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and septic shock.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Her white blood cell count is 9.0 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 56 x 10^9/L. Her hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, and her hematocrit is 27.7%. Her lactate level is 2.2 mmol/L, and her anion gap is normal.

The patient's medical history is significant for VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which has been treated with linezolid and daptomycin. She also has a history of septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and chronic heart failure.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, and acyclovir. She is also receiving famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient's plan of care includes continued broad antimicrobial coverage, close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. She will also receive supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and electrolyte replacement.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may require further ventilatory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and VRE bacteremia, and she may be at risk for further septic episodes.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock and chronic heart failure, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, and she may require further transfusions or platelet support.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, and she may require further anticoagulation or platelet support.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, and she may require further thyroid hormone replacement.
7. Anxiety: The patient may experience further anxiety, and she may require further psychological support or sedation.

In summary, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with ALL who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and septic shock. She has a complex medical history and is at risk for further medical complications."

   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 127
   - mechanical ventilation
 try PS again if pt more awake
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   - consider lasix diuresis to goal of -1-2 L per 24 hrs
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory failure due to prolonged hospitalization, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F) (max) and 36.4°C (97.5°F) (current)
* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute (bpm) (range 93-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/66 mmHg (range 80-132/91-105 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (range 12-21 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (SpO2)

The patient has the following laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 4.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 63 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL

* Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both, with possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, and Klebsiella pneumonia
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: No growth on cultures since 4/12, but infected Omaya removed on 4/16 and indwelling left femoral venous TLC removed on 5/7
* Hyponatremia: likely SIADH, improved from prior
* Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension/shock
* Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): likely in the setting of acidosis/alkalosis
* ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT, s/p donor lymphocyte infusion, s/p chemotherapy
* Coagulopathy: elevated INR
* Anemia: [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy, and acute blood loss from procedures
* Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
* Anxiety: has been a significant component of the patient's presentation, although doubtful that anxiety was related to the patient's tachypnea
*? Asthma: continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during her hospital course)
* Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
* Monitoring of UOP, lactate levels, and hemodynamics
* F/u blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture
* Consider lasix diuresis to goal of -1-2 L per 24 hours
* F/u ID recs
* Fluid restriction to 1 L
* Monitor serial Na
* Consider salt tabs
* F/u renal recs
* Continue to monitor lactate levels
* PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with latex)
* Monitor and replete potassium as needed
* Active type and screen
* Transfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
* Monitor Hct in PM
* Monitor PLT levels
* Transfuse for <20
* Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol
* On IV levothyroxine

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, with a code status of full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 127
   - mechanical ventilation
 try PS again if pt more awakd
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. The patient's medical history includes chronic heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and septic shock. She has undergone multiple line placements and has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungals.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to cardiogenic shock and septic shock, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to her chronic heart failure and may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and cardiac death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to her VRE bacteremia and may lead to further complications such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
4. VRE bacteremia: The patient's VRE bacteremia is likely due to her prolonged hospitalization and may lead to further complications such as bacteremia, sepsis, and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to her cardiogenic shock and septic shock and may lead to further complications such as organ failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to her SIADH and may lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
7. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion-gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to her tissue hypoperfusion and may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
8. Abnormal potassium levels: The patient's abnormal potassium levels are likely due to her acidosis and alkalosis and may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to her elevated INR and may lead to further complications such as bleeding, hematoma, and death.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her chronic blood loss and may lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and death.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to her chemotherapy and malignancy and may lead to further complications such as bleeding, hematoma, and death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications due to her underlying medical conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple line placements. Close monitoring and management of her condition are essential to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 66.
   - mechanical ventilation
 SBT today
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a bone marrow transplant and has been experiencing prolonged hospitalization due to a VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was previously intubated but was extubated and is now breathing spontaneously with a respiratory rate of 23. She has a PEEP of 0 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 35%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 105 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg. Her lactate levels are stable, and she has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, which is being treated with broad antimicrobial coverage.
* Renal: The patient has a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and is at risk for acute kidney injury. She is being monitored for urine output and is receiving IV fluids.
* Hematological: The patient has a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL and a platelet count of 50 K/uL. She is at risk for bleeding and is being monitored for platelet levels.
* Neurological: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 and is at risk for neurological complications due to her underlying condition and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and treatment.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, which is being treated with broad antimicrobial coverage. She is at risk for further deterioration and may require additional interventions.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for acute kidney injury and may require dialysis if her kidney function continues to decline.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her low platelet count and may require transfusions.
* Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to her underlying condition and treatment, and may require additional interventions to manage these complications.
* Infection: The patient has a VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and is at risk for further infection and sepsis.
* Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and is at risk for anemia, which may require transfusions.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding, which may require transfusions.

The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been advised to contact the hospital if they have any concerns or questions."

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 127
   - mechanical ventilation
 try PS again if pt more awake
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   - consider lasix diuresis to goal of -1-2 L per 24 hrs
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a stem cell transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, and her fluid balance is 1,951 mL of total intake and 4,197 mL of total output.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Her electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her blood cultures are negative, and her urinalysis shows a specific gravity of 1.020 and a pH of 5.5.

The patient's medical history includes a history of VRE bacteremia, which is currently being treated with daptomycin. She also has a history of sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her current medications include meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, and acyclovir.

The patient's plan of care includes continued broad antimicrobial coverage, monitoring of her urine output, and consideration of dobutamine if her urine output decreases. She will also be monitored for signs of infection, and her line will be removed if it becomes infected. Her nutrition will be managed through a feeding tube, and her glycemic control will be monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her current infection may lead to septic shock.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock and her current medication regimen may increase her risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. ARDS: The patient's history of ARDS and her current respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory distress.
4. VRE bacteremia: The patient's current infection with VRE bacteremia may lead to further complications, such as sepsis and organ failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding, especially if she requires invasive procedures.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding, especially if she requires invasive procedures.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may increase her risk of fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require close monitoring and adjustment of her medication regimen.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and her current infection pose a significant risk of medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has been hospitalized for prolonged periods and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a face tent and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her neurological examination is normal, with movement of her hands and wiggling of her toes. 

The patient has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, which is improving, and has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. 

The patient's plan includes continued antimicrobial coverage for VRE bacteremia, diuresis with Lasix, and monitoring of her respiratory status. She is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.

3. Infection: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia and may be at risk for further infections, including sepsis and septic shock.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of elevated INR and may be at risk for further coagulopathy, including bleeding and thrombosis.

5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving tube feeds and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including aspiration and nausea.

   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: likely [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w
   LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn). s/p intubation [**5-6**]
 [**5-11**], now extubated.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - check ABG
   - O2 by face mask, wean as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**].
   Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem (6/8
 [**5-12**]),
   daptomycin (5/18
 [**5-13**]), ciprofloxacin (6/9
 [**5-10**]), atovaqone,
   acyclovir
   - monitor UOP
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   - consider lasix diuresis to goal of -1-2 L per 24 hrs (currently
   autodiuresing)
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - daptomycin (5/18
 [**5-13**]) through Sunday
   - f/u bl cxs
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, stable ~130
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate stable ~2. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.  Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

* The patient is a 60-year-old female with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion.
* She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
* The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and has undergone multiple hospitalizations.
* She is currently extubated and receiving oxygen therapy via a face mask.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg.
* Her respiratory status is being monitored, and she is receiving broad antimicrobial coverage with meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and acyclovir.
* The patient has several medical complications, including:
	+ Hypotension/Shock: likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock, with a low UOP and elevated lactate.
	+ VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: treated with linezolid and now switched to daptomycin.
	+ Hyponatremia: likely due to SIADH, with a stable sodium level of ~130.
	+ Anemia: due to chemotherapy, malignancy, and acute blood loss from procedures.
	+ Thrombocytopenia: due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
	+ Coagulopathy: with an elevated INR.
	+ Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: likely due to tissue hypoperfusion, but has resolved.
	+ Anxiety: a significant component of the patient's presentation, although stable.
	+ Hypothyroidism: being treated with IV levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Cardiogenic or septic shock leading to organ failure or death.
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement leading to meningitis or encephalitis.
* Hyponatremia leading to seizures or coma.
* Anemia leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding or petechiae.
* Coagulopathy leading to bleeding or bruising.
* Anion-gap metabolic acidosis leading to further organ dysfunction or death.
* Anxiety leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, or other cardiovascular complications.
* Hypothyroidism leading to decreased metabolic rate, fatigue, or decreased cognitive function."

    MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  60 yo F with ALL recurrence with prolonged
   hospital course c/b difficult to clear high grade VRE bacteremia, prior
   ICU transfer for AMS, sepsis with PEA arrest, resp failure and VRE
   ommaya shunt infection, s/p removal and evac of SDH.  Has advanced
   cardiac dysfunction-- TTE with global HK and EF 20%.  Returned to ICU
   with acidosis and hypotension felt [**1-1**] cardiogenic + septic shock now
   doing well post extubation. Had profound lactic acidosis felt likely
   related to linezolid mitochondrial toxicity which also improved.
   Diuresed with lasix 40 with good u/o response.

   (to complete prolonged course Dapto on [**5-13**]).  Effussions/edema
   contributing to continued though low O2 requirement.  She is
   auto-diuresing well and tolerating intermittent IV lasix. Follow i/o's
   and give lasix as needed to achieve neg fluid balance (of goal 1L).
   Respiratory alkalosis is stable and has been present through much of
   pt
s course--? related to CNS infection/anxiety. Per prior speech

   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Will monitor closely in ICU, continue to diurese and initiate TFs.  Can
   likely transferr to floor tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

    MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  60 yo F with ALL recurrence with prolonged
   hospital course c/b difficult to clear high grade VRE bacteremia, prior
   ICU transfer for AMS, sepsis with PEA arrest, resp failure and VRE
   ommaya shunt infection, s/p removal and evac of SDH.  Has advanced
   cardiac dysfunction-- TTE with global HK and EF 20%.  Returned to ICU
   with acidosis and hypotension felt [**1-1**] cardiogenic + septic shock now
   doing well post extubation. Had profound lactic acidosis felt likely
   related to linezolid mitochondrial toxicity which also improved.
   Diuresed with lasix 40 with good u/o response.

     * Klebsiella pna
     * hyponatremia (improving)
     * resp alkalosis (persistent during this hospitalization)
     * CMP (ef 20%)
     * ALL recurrence
         Coagulaopathy
         Anemia (stable)
   Continues to improve--doing well from respiratory standpoint post
   extubation
on 35% FT. Agree with plan to continue
   antibx--for klebsiella pna ([**Last Name (un) 1540**] day [**6-4**] ) and persistent vre infection
   (to complete prolonged course Dapto on [**5-13**]).  Effussions/edema
   contributing to continued though low O2 requirement.  She is
   auto-diuresing well and tolerating intermittent IV lasix. Follow i/o's
   and give lasix as needed to achieve neg fluid balance (of goal 1L).
   Respiratory alkalosis is stable and has been present through much of
   pt
s course--? related to CNS infection/anxiety. Per prior speech
   swallow eval should undergo video swallow--will place ngt
   for nutrition/po meds and arrange. Hyponatremia is improving with free
   water restriction, will continue to monitor.
   ICU: Fem line, boots, ssi, H2B
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Will monitor closely in ICU, continue to diurese and initiate TFs.  Can
   likely transferr to floor tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplant, donor lymphocyte infusion, and chemotherapy. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, shock, and VRE bacteremia with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 35% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). She is extubated and has bilateral breath sounds.

The patient has a history of prolonged hospitalization, multiple ICU admissions, and VRE bacteremia, which has led to CNS involvement. She has also had a prolonged course of chemotherapy, which has caused bone marrow suppression, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 57 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 14 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: Na 135 mmol/L, K 4.1 mmol/L, Cl 99 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 412 IU/L

The patient's medical issues include:

* Acute respiratory failure (resolved)
* Shock (resolved) - cardiogenic/septic etiology
* Klebsiella pneumonia
* Hyponatremia (improving)
* Respiratory alkalosis (persistent)
* Chronic myeloid leukemia (CMP) - EF 20%
* ALL recurrence
* Coagulopathy
* Anemia (stable)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing broad antimicrobial coverage for Klebsiella pneumonia and VRE infection
* Monitoring urine output and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed
* Placing a nasogastric tube (NGT) for tube feeds and medications
* Arranging for a video swallow evaluation
* Continuing to monitor electrolyte levels and adjusting therapy as needed
* Transferring the patient to the floor if stable

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to Klebsiella pneumonia or VRE infection
* Shock due to cardiogenic or septic etiology
* Hyponatremia or hypernatremia due to changes in sodium levels
* Respiratory alkalosis due to CNS infection or anxiety
* Coagulopathy due to liver dysfunction or warfarin therapy
* Anemia due to bone marrow suppression or bleeding
* Thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppression or bleeding

The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU, and she is expected to continue to improve with ongoing therapy and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), donor lymphocyte infusion, and chemotherapy. She has been hospitalized multiple times, including the current admission to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which was treated with linezolid and has since been switched to daptomycin.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is extubated and requires oxygen therapy via face mask. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 23, which suggests respiratory acidosis.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the etiology of hypotension is unclear, with possibilities of cardiogenic, septic, or both.
3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which was treated with linezolid and has since been switched to daptomycin.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are improving, likely due to SIADH.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to chemotherapy, malignancy, and acute blood loss from procedures.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
7. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels have stabilized, and the diagnosis is likely due to tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension/shock.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, but stable.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring respiratory status and weaning oxygen therapy as tolerated.
2. Checking ABG results and treating possible cardiogenic and septic shock.
3. Continuing broad antimicrobial coverage with meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and atovaqone.
4. Monitoring urine output and fluid balance.
5. Diuresis with lasix to achieve a goal of -1 L per 24 hours.
6. Monitoring electrolytes and adjusting tube feed with NS flushes as necessary.
7. Transfusing blood products as needed.
8. Monitoring platelet levels and transfusing as necessary.
9. Monitoring INR and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
10. Transferring the patient to the floor if stable.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure may drop further, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient may develop further complications related to VRE bacteremia, such as meningitis or sepsis.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels may continue to decline, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
7. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who has undergone transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has been admitted to the hospital multiple times, including the current ICU admission, due to prolonged hospitalization and VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure, likely secondary to cardiogenic or septic shock
* Hypotension, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic shock
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, with no growth on cultures since April 12
* Hyponatremia, likely due to SIADH
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to chemotherapy and malignancy
* Possible underlying diagnoses of asthma, hypothyroidism, and anion-gap metabolic acidosis

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6-12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2-27.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 46-77 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-26.4 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Antibiotics: meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and acyclovir
* Vasopressors: unknown
* Diuretics: furosemide
* Sedatives: lorazepam
* Antacids: famotidine
* Antithrombotics: unknown
* Antihypertensives: unknown

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring respiratory status, including ABG and O2 saturation
* Checking for signs of cardiogenic and septic shock
* Continuing broad antimicrobial coverage
* Monitoring UOP and f/u blood cultures, UA, urine culture, and sputum culture
* Initiating lasix diuresis goal of -1 L per 24 hours
* Monitoring hyponatremia and SIADH
* Transfusing blood products as necessary
* Monitoring platelet count and transfusing if < 20
* Monitoring anion-gap metabolic acidosis and lactate levels
* Monitoring coagulopathy and INR
* Continuing tube feeds through NG tube
* Monitoring glycemic control

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to cardiogenic or septic shock
* Hypotension and shock
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and possible dissemination to other organs
* Hyponatremia and SIADH
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Anion-gap metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis
* Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency
* Asthma exacerbation
* Infection and sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure optimal care."

   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Hypotension/Shock: Poor urine output with tachycardia following Lasix
   dose yesterday. Received small boluses yesterday however is third
   spacing. Blood pressure currently stable. Etiology of shock cardiogenic
   vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock in the setting of severe acute on
   chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection
   w possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection
   (s/p R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**]
   sputum cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella), s/p new line placement
   [**5-7**].
   - completed meropenem (6/8
 [**5-12**]), daptomycin (5/18
 [**5-13**]),
   ciprofloxacin (6/9

   - monitor UOP, hold off on further Lasix
   - if UOP continues to decrease Albumin to increase intravascular load
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # Acute respiratory failure: likely [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w
   LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn). Extubated [**5-11**], on face tent.
   - monitor respiratory status and ABG as needed
   - O2 by face mask/tent, wean as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (as above)
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.

   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.

   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - transfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  will start IV levothyroxine if unable to take tube
   feeds.
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.
   # Coagulopathy: stable elevated INR
   - Monitor INR.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed the resident
s note
   including the assessment and plan and agree with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya
   reservior and evacuated a subdural hematoma. At that time, TTE showed
   global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status
   improved and transferred to BMT floor on [**4-21**]. Returned to the ICU with
   respiratory failure and shock,- this time, we were able to re-site the
   line to the right femoral and now she is improving.  She is off the
   ventilator and has been doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
   Overnight:  Her urine output was low overnight and had some tachycardia
   T 96.7  P 113  BP 113/69  SaO2: 100%
   Gen: Awake, alert NAD
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Cor: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NTND
   Ext: +1 edema bilaterally
   Cultures:
   Klebsiella pneumonia from sputum otherwise no new culture growth
   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   a. Now extubated and respiratory status ok
   b. Continue to monitor
   2) Metabolic Acidosis
   a. Resolved
   3) Decreased urine output: Follow urine output
 if decreases again,
   will try some albumin as she seems to be intra-vascularly depleted yet
   total body overload
   4) Hypokalemia: replace as needed
   5) Anemia:
   6) Nutritional: Tube feedings
   Time Spent: 35 minutes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed the resident

   including the assessment and plan and agree with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya
   reservior and evacuated a subdural hematoma. At that time, TTE showed
   global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status
   improved and transferred to BMT floor on [**4-21**]. Returned to the ICU with
   respiratory failure and shock,- this time, we were able to re-site the
   line to the right femoral and now she is improving.  She is off the
   ventilator and has been doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
   Overnight:  Her urine output was low overnight and had some tachycardia

   b. Continue to monitor
   2) Metabolic Acidosis
   a. Resolved
   3) Decreased urine output: Follow urine output
 if decreases again,
   will try some albumin as she seems to be intra-vascularly depleted yet

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been in and out of the intensive care unit (ICU) during her prolonged hospital course. She has undergone allogeneic non-related donor stem cell transplantation (SCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion, and has developed VRE bacteremia with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is extubated and on a face tent, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 414.
* Cardiovascular: She has cardiogenic shock, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%, and is at risk for septic shock due to her VRE bacteremia.
* Renal: Her urine output is low, with a total output of 2,297 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia and anemia, with a platelet count of 46 and a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL.
* Neurological: She has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, with no focal neurological deficits.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypotension/shock: Due to cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
* Acute respiratory failure: Due to cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
* VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient has been treated with linezolid and daptomycin, and is currently on a course of daptomycin.
* ALL: The patient has been in remission for 4 years after donor lymphocyte infusion, but has relapsed.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, but has resolved.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) due to chemotherapy and malignancy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels.
* Administration of antibiotics to treat VRE bacteremia.
* Supportive care to manage cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
* Transfusion of blood products to treat anemia and thrombocytopenia.
* Nutritional support through tube feedings.
* Monitoring of platelet counts and hemoglobin levels.
* Administration of anticoagulant therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the patient's current status and medical complications, the potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Worsening of cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to low urine output.
* Development of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
* Development of respiratory failure due to cardiogenic shock and septic shock.
* Development of sepsis due to VRE bacteremia.
* Development of complications related to chemotherapy and malignancy, such as neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed the resident
s note
   including the assessment and plan and agree with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya
   reservior and evacuated a subdural hematoma. At that time, TTE showed
   global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status
   improved and transferred to BMT floor on [**4-21**]. Returned to the ICU with
   respiratory failure and shock,- this time, we were able to re-site the

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been in the ICU for respiratory failure and shock. She has a prolonged hospital course with multiple admissions and has been treated with chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion, and stem cell transplantation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is off the ventilator and has been doing well from a respiratory standpoint, with mild hypoxia requiring 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
* Shock: The patient's urine output was low overnight, but improved with albumin and lasix.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of severe acute on chronic CHF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% on echocardiogram.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and has been treated with antibiotics.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and malignancy.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and will start IV levothyroxine if unable to take tube feeds.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has resolved.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a stable elevated INR.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if her oxygenation or ventilation becomes compromised.
* Shock: The patient's shock can worsen if her cardiac function or blood volume becomes compromised.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen if her infection is not adequately treated.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if her blood loss or bone marrow suppression becomes more severe.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen if her platelet count becomes more severely low.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can worsen if she is not adequately treated with thyroid hormone replacement.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia can worsen if she becomes dehydrated or if her sodium levels become too low.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen if her INR becomes too high or if she develops bleeding complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued gentle diuresis for her respiratory failure
* Monitoring of her urine output and electrolyte levels
* Replacement of her anemia and thrombocytopenia as needed
* Treatment of her sepsis with antibiotics
* Management of her hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement
* Monitoring of her coagulopathy and bleeding risk
* Physical therapy to improve her mobility and reduce her risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic non-related stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion, followed by chemotherapy. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis. She has a prolonged hospitalization with multiple admissions and is now experiencing VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and ongoing infections. She is at risk for aspiration, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, which are likely related to her underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to her underlying cardiogenic shock and sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to further compromise of her respiratory status.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress if not effectively treated, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. VRE bacteremia: The patient's VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement may lead to further complications, including meningitis, abscesses, and septicemia.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen if not effectively managed, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of infection.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding complications and worsen her respiratory status.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not effectively managed, leading to further compromise of her respiratory status and other organ systems.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if not effectively managed, leading to further compromise of her respiratory status and other organ systems.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase her risk of infection and further compromise her respiratory status.
10. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration may increase if not effectively managed, leading to further compromise of her respiratory status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and ABG levels closely.
2. Treat the patient's cardiogenic shock and sepsis aggressively with medications and fluids as needed.
3. Manage the patient's VRE bacteremia with antibiotics and close monitoring of her laboratory results.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia closely and transfuse as needed.
5. Manage the patient's coagulopathy with close monitoring of her INR and transfusion as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and hyponatremia closely and treat as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's impaired skin integrity closely and treat any infections promptly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's risk of aspiration and take measures to reduce this risk.
9. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as an intermediate care unit or a step-down unit, once her respiratory status has stabilized and her other comorbidities are under better control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone an allogenic non-related stem cell transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (105-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 96/70 mmHg (75-138/87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (20-37 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 57 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
* Chloride: 99 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 23.1 mmol/L
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and she has undergone multiple line placements and removals. She has also received antibiotics, including meropenem, daptomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula. She is also receiving diuretic therapy to manage her fluid status.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also critical, with cardiogenic shock and sepsis. She is receiving vasopressor therapy to manage her blood pressure.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she is receiving tube feeds. She is also receiving medications to manage her anxiety, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's coagulation status is compromised, with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). She is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with IV levothyroxine.

The patient's hyponatremia has resolved.

The patient's code status is full code.

The patient's disposition is likely to be transitioned to the floor today, with a plan for physical therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiovascular status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, and she is at risk of further septic episodes.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen without further transfusions.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely to worsen without further transfusions.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, and she is at risk of further bleeding.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with IV levothyroxine, but she may require further treatment.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, but she may be at risk of developing it again.
* Asthma: The patient's asthma is unclear, and she may require further treatment.
* Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is stable, but she may require further treatment.
* Skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and she is at risk of further skin breakdown."
