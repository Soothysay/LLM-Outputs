You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of DM1, CABG, and vasculopathy, initially admitted for LE ulcers. She developed altered mental status, respiratory failure, and persistent elevated WBC. She was transferred to the ICU after passing blood clots from below with SBP in the 90s. The patient has a GIB (likely lower), vasculopathy, renal failure on chronic HD, and is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including PICC line placement, EKG, and thoracentesis. She has received 2u pRBCs and has been started on bowel prep for colonoscopy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 35.6°C, Tcurrent of 35.4°C, HR of 68 bpm, BP of 133/55 mmHg, RR of 26 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 100%.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB, and the current bleeding is likely lower GIB, as evidenced by the negative NG lavage. The patient is awaiting colonoscopy and has been stabilized with 2u pRBCs.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a WBC count of 16.9, which is likely due to a stress response. She is receiving antibiotics, including vanc, cipro, and flagyl.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on chronic HD and has a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1): The patient has a history of DM1 and is currently NPO, with bedtime insulin dosing.
5. Vasculopathy: The patient has a history of vasculopathy, which is being followed by the vascular service.
6. Pain: The patient is experiencing sacral decubitus ulcer pain and is receiving dilaudid 0.25 prn.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated WBC count may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, particularly if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB could worsen, leading to further bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD could worsen, leading to further kidney damage and potential complications such as electrolyte imbalances.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's vasculopathy and history of CABG may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as MI or arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old female with DM1, CABG, and vasculopathy, was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is being managed for ongoing bleeding, leukocytosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic hemodialysis (HD). The patient has a history of sacral ulcers and necrotic toes, and is being treated for pain and fever. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/55 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: Given the ongoing GIB and the patient's history of vasculopathy, there is a risk of hemorrhagic shock if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's leukocytosis and sacral ulcers increase the risk of septic shock, especially if the wounds become infected.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for thoracentesis and ongoing oxygen therapy, increases the risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CABG and vasculopathy increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state, as evidenced by the need for chronic HD and antibiotics, increases the risk of infection, particularly with Gram-negative bacteria.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's ESRD and ongoing HD increase the risk of renal complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremic syndrome.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and need for chronic HD increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's GIB and ongoing bleeding increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of vasculopathy and chronic HD increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery bypass grafting, vasculopathy, and chronic hemodialysis. She was initially admitted to the vascular service for lower extremity ulcers and was later transferred to the ICU due to a rectal bleed.

The patient's current problems include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (likely lower GI bleed) with negative nasogastric lavage, and she is awaiting colonoscopy.
2. Vasculopathy, which is being managed with anticoagulation therapy, including aspirin, plavix, and subcutaneous heparin, which is currently held due to the acute bleed.
3. Renal failure on chronic hemodialysis.
4. Leukocytosis, which is likely related to sacral ulcer and necrotic toes, and is being managed with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Septic shock due to the patient's leukocytosis and concerns for infection, particularly in the setting of vasculopathy and chronic hemodialysis.
2. Cardiac complications, such as junctional tachycardia and ECG changes, which may be related to demand ischemia, and may require consideration of amiodarone therapy.
3. Respiratory distress, which may be related to fluid overload and may require cautious fluid management to avoid exacerbating the condition.
4. Infection, particularly in the setting of vasculopathy and chronic hemodialysis, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring.
5. Hemorrhagic complications, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy, which may require close monitoring and prompt intervention to prevent bleeding.
6. Cardiovascular instability, particularly in the setting of vasculopathy and chronic hemodialysis, which may require close monitoring and prompt intervention to prevent cardiovascular complications.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of DM1, CABG, and vasculopathy, initially admitted for LE ulcers. Her hospital course has been complicated by altered mental status, respiratory failure, and persistently elevated WBC. She was transferred to the ICU after starting to pass blood clots from below with a SBP in the 90s. The patient is currently experiencing a GI bleed, likely lower, and has been stabilized with 2u pRBCs. She has also been diagnosed with vasculopathy, renal failure on chronic HD, and leukocytosis. The patient is on various medications, including antibiotics, and is awaiting colonoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleed may continue to worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and potential organ failure.
2. Vasculopathy: The patient's underlying vasculopathy may lead to further complications, such as worsening of the GI bleed, renal failure, or even cardiac complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic HD and ongoing vasculopathy may exacerbate her renal failure, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential need for dialysis.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen her condition and lead to further complications.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's chronic HD and ongoing vasculopathy may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia, which may require close monitoring and potential treatment.
6. Infection: The patient's ongoing vasculopathy and GI bleed may increase her risk of developing an infection, which may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's underlying vasculopathy and chronic HD may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and ongoing complications, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further deterioration and potential organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hematochezia, and bradypnea. The patient's 24-hour events are as follows:

* The patient's EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ST depressions, likely junctional tachycardia, which was treated with metoprolol 5 mg IV.
* The patient's blood pressure (BP) fell into the 40s shortly after metoprolol administration, prompting emergent access to the HD line for high-volume fluid resuscitation.
* The patient's BP stabilized with IV fluids and neosynephrine in the low 90s, and vasopressin was started with improvement in BP, allowing weaning off neosynephrine.
* The patient's heart rhythm flipped back into normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but BP remained tenuous.
* The patient's stool was streaked with blood (BRB).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 16.9-20.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 31.3-35.6%
* Platelet count (Plt): 282-326 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 3.0-3.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.74-0.95 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.4-35.1°C (95.7-95.2°F)
* Heart rate: 61-133 bpm
* Blood pressure: 104/67-132/97 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26-31 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Tachypnea
* Tachycardia
* Hypotension
* Streaked blood in stool (BRB)
* Impaired skin integrity

The patient's goals of care have been readdressed with the family, and they have confirmed that the patient is DNR/DNI, with a focus on comfort care. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypovolemic shock due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and fluid loss
* Respiratory failure due to tachypnea and potential aspiration of gastric contents
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to ongoing tachycardia and potential electrolyte imbalances
* Infection due to impaired skin integrity and potential catheter-related infections
* Kidney injury due to hypotension and potential acute tubular necrosis
* Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis and potential electrolyte imbalances."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple organ dysfunction. They have experienced significant cardiovascular instability, including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with ST depressions, and have required emergent fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure. The patient has also developed gastrointestinal bleeding, with a large clot in the rectum, and has impaired skin integrity with multiple necrotic and amputated fingers and toes.

The patient's laboratory results indicate significant derangements, including thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. They have also developed acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, and have required hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of SVT and hypotension increases their risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired skin integrity increase their risk of developing sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL indicates significant kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired platelet function increase their risk of bleeding complications.
5. Wound Infections: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases their risk of developing wound infections.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's poor inspiratory effort and decreased lung sounds at bases increase their risk of developing respiratory failure.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, may worsen if not managed promptly.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases their risk of bleeding complications and may worsen if not managed promptly.
9. Infection: The patient's impaired immune function increases their risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
10. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction increases their risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome."

   A 52 yo lady with multiple medical problems transferred to the MICU for
   GI bleed, now with arrhythmia and shock.
   .
   # Arrhythma and shock:  Likely primarily
   #. Hematochezia:  She continues to have traces of blood per rectum but
   Hct stable.  This is very unlikely to be causing her unstable
   hemodynamic status.  ASA restarted yesterday.  Still holding Plavix
   - Maintain PICC. attempt peripherals ([**Doctor Last Name 6610**] [**Location (un) **] unsuccessful this
   far, could not thread wire); HD Line for emergencies
   - T&X 4 units
   - Transfuse while actively bleeding, Q6 Hcts & lactate
   - GI Consult: Prep for colonoscopy while stable, scope in AM
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold unneccessary PO Meds, NPO
   - Monitor Coags, correct any underlying coagulopathy
   - Hold ASA and plavix until AM
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient's primary medical problem prior to transfer to
   the ICU.  ID following, source still uncertain and no clear pattern to
   WBC.  If she has infarcted bowel, translocation becomes a serious
   concern.  Skin source from wounds/necrotic digits also possible.
   - Follow ID recs-  recommend stopping all antibiotics given no evidence
   of infection
   - F/U Cultures, stool studies
   .
   # ESRD on HD s/p failed renal transplant: followed by nephrology.
   Undergoes MWF dialysis.  No urgent indication for HD at this time.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, Zinc (pending PO tolerance)
   - HD MWF
   .
   # Type 1 DM: followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**].
   - continue long acting insulin with SSI as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG, ? NSTEMI: Currently expressing bigeminy on telemetry
   and experiencing possible hypoperfusion due to blood loss.
   - Continue Atorvastatin 40mg PO daily
   - Hold ASA/Plavix until AM
   - Hold Beta Blocker while bleeding
   - Cycle Cardiac Enzymes
   - EKG Now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old lady with multiple medical problems, including type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of CABG and NSTEMI, and a failed renal transplant. She was admitted to the MICU with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, now with arrhythmia and shock. The patient's condition is unstable, with hypotension, tachycardia, and ST depressions on EKG. She has multiple petechiae on her upper extremities, and her skin integrity is impaired due to wounds and necrotic digits.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 20.2 K/uL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Management of hypotension with vasopressin and fluid resuscitation
* Treatment of arrhythmia with metoprolol and amiodarone
* Control of GI bleed with ASA and PPI
* Management of leukocytosis with ID follow-up and antibiotic discontinuation
* Monitoring of coagulation profile and correction of any underlying coagulopathy
* Hold of ASA and Plavix until AM
* GI consult for colonoscopy
* NPO and hold of unnecessary PO meds
* Monitoring of lactate levels and trend of Hct

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Hemodynamic instability due to blood loss and arrhythmia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to untreated infection
* Renal failure due to inadequate dialysis or electrolyte imbalance
* Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest
* Gastrointestinal complications such as perforation or bleeding
* Skin complications such as infection or necrosis
* Neurological complications such as stroke or seizures due to hypoperfusion or electrolyte imbalance."

   GIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   A 52 yo lady with multiple medical problems transferred to the MICU for
   GI bleed, now with arrhythmia and shock.
   .
   # Arrhythma and shock:  She is intermittently flipping into SVT with
   unstable BP.  In general she is quite responsive to IVF boluses (8.5L
   net in yesterday), but it remains unclear why she requires so much
   fluids.  Vasopressin seems to be working better than neosynephrine as a
   pressor.  Amiodarone loaded this morning, and she just flipped back
   into NSR.
   - wean vasopressin
   - discuss with cardiology antiarrhythmic tx
   - likely will need to start PO amiodarone later today
   - support BP with IVF and vasopressin PRN
   - discuss with patient and family goals of care regarding ongoing
   pressors, etc
   .
   # Demand cardiac ischemia:  dynamic EKG changes in the setting of
   hypotension.  Per patient
s wishes and discussion with cardiology, no
   aggressive interventions planned.
   - Continue Atorvastatin 40mg PO daily
   - continue  ASA, holding plavix for now
   - Hold Beta Blocker while hypotensive
   - serial EKG
   #. Hematochezia:  Patient refused colonoscopy yesterday. She continues
   to have traces of blood per rectum but Hct stable.  This is very
   unlikely to be causing her unstable hemodynamic status.  ASA restarted
   yesterday.  Still holding Plavix
   - Maintain PICC.
   - HD line access for emergency
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart diet as tolerated today
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient's primary medical problem prior to transfer to
   the ICU.  ID following, source still uncertain and no clear pattern to
   WBC.  If she has infarcted bowel, translocation becomes a serious
   concern.  Skin source from wounds/necrotic digits also possible.
   - Follow ID recs-  recommend stopping all antibiotics given no evidence
   of infection
 doing so now
   - F/U Cultures, stool studies
   .
   # ESRD on HD s/p failed renal transplant: followed by nephrology.
   Undergoes MWF dialysis.  No urgent indication for HD at this time.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, Zinc (pending PO tolerance)
   - HD MWF  but will not do today because of hemodynamic instability
   - per renal, may need CVVH if remains hemodynamically unstable
 would
   need to re-address goals of care with family
   .
   # Type 1 DM: followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   A 52 yo lady with multiple medical problems transferred to the MICU for
   GI bleed, now with arrhythmia and shock.
   .
   # Arrhythma and shock:  She is intermittently flipping into SVT with
   unstable BP.  In general she is quite responsive to IVF boluses (8.5L
   net in yesterday), but it remains unclear why she requires so much
   fluids.  Vasopressin seems to be working better than neosynephrine as a
   pressor.  Amiodarone loaded this morning, and she just flipped back
   into NSR.
   - wean vasopressin
   - discuss with cardiology antiarrhythmic tx
   - likely will need to start PO amiodarone later today
   - support BP with IVF and vasopressin PRN
   - discuss with patient and family goals of care regarding ongoing
   pressors, etc
   .
   # Demand cardiac ischemia:  dynamic EKG changes in the setting of
   hypotension.  Per patient
s wishes and discussion with cardiology, no
   aggressive interventions planned.
   - Continue Atorvastatin 40mg PO daily
   - continue  ASA, holding plavix for now
   - Hold Beta Blocker while hypotensive
   - serial EKG
   #. Hematochezia:  Patient refused colonoscopy yesterday. She continues
   to have traces of blood per rectum but Hct stable.  This is very
   unlikely to be causing her unstable hemodynamic status.  ASA restarted
   yesterday.  Still holding Plavix
   - Maintain PICC.
   - HD line access for emergency
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - restart diet as tolerated today
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient's primary medical problem prior to transfer to
   the ICU.  ID following, source still uncertain and no clear pattern to
   WBC.  If she has infarcted bowel, translocation becomes a serious
   concern.  Skin source from wounds/necrotic digits also possible.
   - Follow ID recs-  recommend stopping all antibiotics given no evidence
   of infection
 doing so now
   - F/U Cultures, stool studies
   .
   # ESRD on HD s/p failed renal transplant: followed by nephrology.
   Undergoes MWF dialysis.  No urgent indication for HD at this time.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, Zinc (pending PO tolerance)
   - HD MWF  but will not do today because of hemodynamic instability
   - per renal, may need CVVH if remains hemodynamically unstable
 would
   need to re-address goals of care with family
   .
   # Type 1 DM: followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**].
   - continue long acting insulin with SSI as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   .  .
   # s/p L fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] BPG Angioplasty
   - appreciate vascular following patient
   - wound care recs per vascular
   - continue ASA, hold Plavix for now
   .
   ## normocytic anemia: suspect this is anemia of chronic disease from
   CKD, as her Hct is at baseline. No evidence of bleeding.
   - trend and continue to follow, will likely be obscured by
   bleeding/transfusions
   .
   # FEN: NPOs / replete lytes cautiously given HD
   # PPX: PPI, boots, bowel regimen

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and a history of failed renal transplant. She was transferred to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently experiencing hypotension, arrhythmia, and shock. The patient has been receiving vasopressin and IV fluids to support her blood pressure, and amiodarone has been loaded to control her arrhythmia. She has also been experiencing hematochezia and has refused colonoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's dynamic EKG changes and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiac ischemia. Given her history of cardiac disease and the current situation, it is essential to closely monitor her cardiac status and consider further interventions if necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's hematochezia and refusal of colonoscopy make it challenging to determine the source of the bleeding. It is crucial to continue monitoring her gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely related to her underlying medical conditions, but it is essential to monitor her white blood cell count and consider further diagnostic tests to determine the source of the leukocytosis.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressin and IV fluids to support her blood pressure suggest hemodynamic instability. It is essential to continue monitoring her hemodynamic status and consider further interventions if necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia is likely related to her chronic kidney disease, but it is essential to monitor her hemoglobin levels and consider further diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the anemia.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and hematochezia suggest the possibility of infection. It is essential to monitor her infection status and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's history of end-stage renal disease and current need for dialysis suggest the possibility of renal failure. It is essential to monitor her renal function and consider further interventions if necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further interventions if necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further diagnostic tests to determine the source of the leukocytosis.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and consider further interventions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the anemia.
6. Monitor the patient's infection status and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider further interventions if necessary."
