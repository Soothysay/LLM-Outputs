   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Patient is an 81 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI,
   HTN, CKD here for ERCP now with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: In PACU received 500 cc LR and neo gtt. Patient
   persistently hypotensive. Transferred to Unit. CVL placed. CVP 12-17 on
   arrival so speaks against volume depletion and patient did not lose any
   blood during procedure per anesthesia. Hematocrit stable from yesterday
   and no e/o active bleeding.  Possibilities for hypotension include
   sepsis given white count 46, fever, biliary source. Another possibility
   is cardiogenic given recent NSTEMI and known CHF with EF 35%. No
   evidence of tamponade on ekg and patient does not have muffled heart
   sounds or elev JVD.  Yesterday patient had evidence of demand ischemia.
   - as patient is full code and not with too large of oxygen requirement
   will tolerate moderate pulmonary edema as long as sats okay => will
   order 500 cc bolus of NS and consider additional boluses as needed
   (current CVP 10-12)
   -continue to treat biliary sepsis with vanc and zosyn
 vanc trough
   this AM is 15 so will re-order more vanco this morning
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - sputum culture is contaminated, will have to order another one
   - UA with mod leukocyte esterase, negative nitrate, mod bacteria, urine
   culture pending however zosyn should cover potential urinary source of
   infection
   -BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes initially > 1, now trending down to 0.7 as is CK
   - echo ordered, not yet complete
   - off of neo gtt
   - use dopamine drip for iontropic effect, will tolerate lower MAP as
   patient is tachycardic and trying to not whip the heart if possible
   -cvo2 is 68, crit > 30 so no need for transfusion at this time, would
   consider blood if crit < 25
   .
   # Cholangitis: p/t is s/p ERCP. Elevated white count which has improved
   since yesterday. Patient is currently afebrile x 24 hours.
   -ERCP recs initially to hold asa and plavix, however after event of
   last night, discussed with them need to re-start aspiring and plavix
   and heparin which they are okay with
   -npo for now
   -LFTs are trending down, will continue to follow daily
   -cont zosyn and vanco for now for biliary sepsis
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. EKG initially
   unchanged but then with concordance of ST depression in V4 in the
   setting of Left anterior fascilar block.
   -echo ordered which is pending
   -cardiac enzymes trending down, max troponin > 1
   -continue on aspirin and plavix and heparin
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. Hold lasix given hypotension. CXR with mild
   vol overload but patient maintaining sats with supplemental oxygen.
   - will tolerate some fluid overload in the setting of sepsis as long as
   maintains adequate oxygenation, as patient is full code always able to
   intubate as neede
   - dopamine for pressor support
   .
   # HTN: currently hypotensive, hold bp meds
   .
   # AoCRF: creatinine current trending down still >4. Likely pre-renal or
   atn as patient is likely septic and was getting diuresed. Hold off on
   diuresis for now.  Ordered urine lytes.
   -calculate Feurea today
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -monitor UO
   .
   # BPH:
   hold hytrin given hypotension
   .
   # Macular degeneration: not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: 500 cc bolus NS, no lasix given blood pressure, replete lytes
   prn, okay to have ice chips
   .
   # PPx: protonix, iv heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and macular degeneration. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, during which he developed hypotension and demand ischemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/43 mmHg, which is below the normal range. He received a 500cc bolus of normal saline (NS) and is being treated with dopamine to support his blood pressure.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is 46, and he has a fever, which suggests that he may have sepsis. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for biliary sepsis.
* Cardiac issues: The patient has a recent NSTEMI and is being treated with aspirin, plavix, and heparin. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, and he has been prescribed dopamine to support his blood pressure.
* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level is >4, which suggests that he has chronic kidney disease. His urine output is being monitored, and he is being treated with dopamine to avoid nephrotoxic agents.
* Cholangitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and he is being treated with Zosyn and vancomycin for biliary sepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypotension may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen and lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
* Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and treatment with dopamine may lead to kidney injury or failure.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient's hypotension and treatment with dopamine may lead to pulmonary edema.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he may require intubation if his condition deteriorates.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuous monitoring of his vital signs, cardiac enzymes, and liver function tests.
* Treatment with dopamine to support his blood pressure and cardiac function.
* Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn for biliary sepsis.
* Fluid management with normal saline and dopamine to avoid fluid overload.
* Monitoring of his urine output and creatinine level to adjust his fluid and medication management.
* Consideration of additional diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and urine cultures to guide his treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Patient is an 81 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI,
   HTN, CKD here for ERCP now with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient appears euvolemic on exam. In PACU received 500
   cc LR and neo gtt. Patient persistently hypotensive. Transferred to
   Unit. CVL placed. CVP 12-17 so speaks against volume depletion and
   patient did not lose any blood during procedure per anesthesia.
   Hematocrit stable from yesterday and no e/o active bleeding.
   Possibilities for hypotension include sepsis given white count 46,
   fever, biliary source. CXR without consolidation. Another possibility
   is cardiogenic given recent NSTEMI and known CHF with EF 35%. No
   evidence of tamponade on ekg and patient does not have muffled heart
   sounds or elev JVD.
   -treat biliary sepsis with vanc and zosyn
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - sputum culture is contaminated, will have to order another one
   - UA with mod leukocyte esterase, negative nitrate, mod bacteria, urine
   culture pending
   -BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes initially > 1, now trending down as is CK
   - echo ordered, not yet complete
   -cvp goal [**9-24**]
   -neo gtt to titrate map > 60, dopamine for iontropic effect, will
   tolerate lower MAP as patient is tachycardic and trying to not whip the
   heart if possible
   -cvo2 is 68, crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to mucous plugging as patient had secretions per
   anesthesia. Also likely component of volume overload seen on cxr and pt
   has known chf. Limited by blood pressure for diuresis at this time.
   -cont supplemental oxygen
   -calc AA gradient
   -prn nebs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by hypotension, which is not attributed to volume depletion or blood loss during the procedure. The patient's hematocrit is stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding. The possible causes of hypotension include sepsis, given the patient's white blood cell count of 46, fever, and biliary source, as well as cardiogenic shock due to the recent NSTEMI and known heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, which is likely due to mucous plugging and volume overload seen on the chest X-ray. The patient has known chronic heart failure and is currently tachycardic.

The patient has cholangitis, which is treated with antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and an echocardiogram has been ordered.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AoCRF) with a creatinine level of 4, which is likely pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and nephrotoxic agents are being avoided.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including hypertension, chronic heart failure, and macular degeneration, which are being managed accordingly.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a fever, which may indicate sepsis. This condition can lead to organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's recent NSTEMI and known heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% increase the risk of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
5. Infection: The patient's cholangitis and sepsis may lead to infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause septic shock.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's recent NSTEMI and known heart failure increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after developing hypotension and suspected sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure.

The patient's current condition is complicated by recurrent cardiac ischemia, presumed sepsis, and shock. He is being treated with dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg, and levophed has been added to support blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin-T, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating ongoing cardiac and metabolic stress. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, but he still has a large leukocytosis, which may be related to cholangitis or sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: Recurrent cardiac ischemia and shock can lead to further cardiac damage, including infarction or arrhythmias.
2. Sepsis: The patient's suspected sepsis can progress to septic shock, multi-organ failure, or death if not adequately treated.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis may not be fully treated, leading to persistent infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic heart failure and recent cardiac ischemia may lead to respiratory failure, particularly if not managed with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
6. Infection: The patient's multiple lines and tubes increase the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and treated with evidence-based therapies, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on his condition and treatment plan to ensure informed decision-making and optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Patient is an 81 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI,
   HTN, CKD here for ERCP now with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for hypovolemia, demand ischemia and sepsis. Now
   only on dopamine with good urine output, steady BP and HR. Echo will be
   performed tomorrow to further evaluate cardiac function. Cardiac
   enzymes trending down, likely in light of demand ischemia and not new
   reinfarction. In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still
   pending while WBC trending down. Will need to repeat a sputum culture
   if possible. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources given
   instrumentation.
   -continue vanc and zosyn for biliary sepsis
   - f/u blood cultures
   -TTE tomorrow
   -continue to attempt at weaning off pressors
   .
   # Cholangitis: p/t is s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs trending down (only LDH
   remains elevated). Has remained afebrile with minimal abdominal
   discomfort. On vanco/zosyn.
   -adv diet as tolerated if ok with ERCP
   -continue to trend labs
   -cont zosyn and vanco for biliary sepsis; clarify with ERCP what is end
   date of abx coverage
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. Appreciate
   cardiology recommendations- the feel is that this is demand ischemia
   and not reinfarction. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Continue on ASA,
   plavix, heparin.
   -f/u echo as above
   -telemetry
   -continue on aspirin and plavix and heparin; can restart BB once
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. CXR with mild vol overload but patient
   maintaining sats with supplemental oxygen. Would hold off on giving
   lasix since on exam he still appears slightly dry. Would cautiously
   give fluids with goal of 30cc/hr.
   - monitor BP, holding
   - attempt to wean dopamine as tolerated
   .
   # HTN: currently hypotensive, hold bp meds
   .
   # AoCRF: FeUrea 41.7% with is borderline and nondiagnostic. Would
   repeat urine lytes as those used to calculate were from [**9-8**]. However
   most likely pre-renal/ATN in etiology. Hold off on lasix for time being
   given hypotension unless UOP is not responding to fluid boluses.
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -monitor UO
   .
   # BPH:
   hold hytrin given hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and recently had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation and management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his temperature is 36.3°C (97.4°F).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 57.1 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 353 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 4.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* TropT: 0.82 ng/mL (normal range: 0.0-0.1 ng/mL)
* Troponin-T: 0.62 ng/mL (normal range: 0.0-0.1 ng/mL)
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)

The patient is receiving dopamine infusion for hypotension and has good urine output. He is also receiving antibiotics for suspected biliary sepsis and has a central line and arterial line in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypotension increase the risk of cardiac complications such as reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Sepsis: The patient's biliary sepsis and suspected pneumonia increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is not adequate, which increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is increased, and his oxygen saturation is slightly decreased, which increases the risk of respiratory failure and pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent ERCP and suspected cholangitis increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and sepsis.
6. Infection: The patient's central line and arterial line increase the risk of infection, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and arterial line-associated infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is decreased, which increases the risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of worsening condition. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, dopamine, and heparin. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg, and fluid balance is stable.

The patient has a history of respiratory support, with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result showing a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 26 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 81 mmHg. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 57.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.9 g/dL, and creatinine (Cr) of 4.6 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and Cr levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for oxygen therapy and ABG results suggest respiratory compromise, which can progress to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated Cr levels may indicate renal failure, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's limited physical examination may indicate neurological compromise, which can lead to permanent damage if not addressed promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP suggest a high risk of infection, which can worsen the patient's condition.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's requirement for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may indicate gastrointestinal compromise, which can lead to bleeding, perforation, or obstruction."

   only on dopamine with good urine output, steady BP and HR. Echo will be
   performed tomorrow to further evaluate cardiac function. Cardiac
   enzymes trending down, likely in light of demand ischemia and not new
   reinfarction. In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still
   pending while WBC trending down. Will need to repeat a sputum culture
   if possible. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources given
   instrumentation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a past medical history of CAD, s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and CKD. He is currently in the ICU following ERCP and is being treated for hypotension, biliary sepsis, cholangitis, CAD, CHF, and AoCRF. He is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiovascular medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg. His laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury, and elevated LDH levels, suggesting potential organ damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his biliary sepsis and recent instrumentation. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect any signs of sepsis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypotension increase his risk for cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias. Close monitoring of his cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram is essential to detect any changes in cardiac function.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's AoCRF and hypotension increase his risk for renal complications, including acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of his urine output and electrolyte levels is essential to detect any changes in renal function.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's CHF and hypotension increase his risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential to detect any changes in respiratory function.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cholangitis and recent instrumentation increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, including infection and bleeding. Close monitoring of his abdominal pain and bowel movements is essential to detect any changes in gastrointestinal function.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and need for pressor support increase his risk for hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and heart rate is essential to detect any changes in hemodynamic status.
7. Infection: The patient's recent instrumentation and biliary sepsis increase his risk for infection. Close monitoring of his temperature and white blood cell count is essential to detect any signs of infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's AoCRF and recent instrumentation increase his risk for bleeding. Close monitoring of his bleeding risk and laboratory results is essential to detect any changes in bleeding risk.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, including sepsis, cardiac complications, renal complications, respiratory complications, gastrointestinal complications, hemodynamic instability, infection, and bleeding. Close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition is essential to detect any changes in his condition and to provide timely interventions to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, HTN, CHF, and recent NSTEMI. He is currently in the ICU and has been treated for sepsis, cholangitis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered end-expiratory wheezes and rales at the bases of his lungs, as well as a soft abdomen with no further tenderness. His skin is warm and without rashes, and his neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 57.1, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 353 K/uL. His creatinine level is 4.5 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 0.82 ng/mL.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Pressor dependence: The patient remains on dopamine, which suggests that his blood pressure is still not stable.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for sepsis, but his leukocytosis and LFT abnormalities suggest that the infection may not be fully resolved.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his renal function is not improving despite fluid administration.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has been treated for cholangitis, but his LFT abnormalities suggest that the infection may not be fully resolved.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of CAD and has had recent NSTEMI, which may contribute to his cardiovascular instability.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI make him susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is not optimal, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his renal function is not improving, which may indicate renal failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and LFT abnormalities suggest that the infection may not be fully resolved, which may lead to sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI make him susceptible to cardiovascular instability, which may lead to cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension following ERCP. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently on a clear diet. The ERCP was performed 1-16 months ago, and a renal USG showed no signs of hydronephrosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 56-71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/47-135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft, nontender abdomen, clear lungs, and normal heart sounds. The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 57.1-32.1, hemoglobin of 30.1-28.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 34-19.5 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 4.3-4.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.62-0.82 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of ERCP and antibiotics, there is a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, but further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of ERCP and antibiotics increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of ERCP and antibiotics increases the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and altered mental status.
7. Infection: The patient's history of ERCP and antibiotics increases the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Bleeding: The patient's history of ERCP and antibiotics increases the risk of bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock and organ dysfunction.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and managing their care accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old who was admitted to the ICU after developing hypotension following an ERCP procedure. The patient was weaned off pressors and started on a clear diet. The ERCP was performed 1-16 months ago, and a renal USG showed no hydronephrosis. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's physical examination is notable for hypoactive bowel sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no edema.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 57.1 K/uL, and the platelet count is 34 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT level of 78 IU/L and an AST level of 32 IU/L. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.62 ng/mL, and the CK-MB level is 7 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of ERCP and antibiotic use, there is a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase level and history of ERCP suggest a risk of pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis, sepsis, and death.
3. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and PTT levels suggest a risk of bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, suggesting a risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the SpO2 is 97%, suggesting a risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hypoactive bowel sounds and history of ERCP suggest a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests a risk of renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and death.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's elevated glucose level and history of ERCP suggest a risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, which can lead to ketoacidosis and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) now with hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved. Initially concern for hypovolemia, demand
   ischemia, and sepsis. Pressures discontinued yesterday around 5pm.
   Maintaining pressures very well. Good urine output.
       In terms of etiology, cardiac enzymes trended down; no indication
   of new reinfarction.
       In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still pending while
   WBC trending down. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources
   given instrumentation.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for biliary sepsis
   - Continue to monitor cultures
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs trending down (only LDH remains
   elevated). Has remained afebrile with minimal abdominal discomfort.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for possible biliary sepsis
   - Touch base with GI
 if okay, will advance diet as tolerated; also
   find out how long to dose antibiotics
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. Appreciate
   cardiology recommendations- the feel is that this is demand ischemia
   and not reinfarction. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Continue on ASA,
   plavix, heparin. When able to tolerate, will add on beta-blcoker.s
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - D/c heparin drip
   - Continue adding on beta-blocker when able to tolerate
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. Appears euvolemic at this time.
   .
   # HTN: As off of pressors for <24 hours, will hold BP meds at this
   time.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output. Will hold
   off on given fluid at this time given history of heart failure. Avoid
   nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely
   .
   # BPH:
   -          Continue to hold hytrin
   -          Foley in place
   .
   # Macular degeneration: Not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: prn bolus NS, replete lytes prn, adv diet as tolerated
   .
   # PPx: protonix, heparin SC TID
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line
   - Will d/c A-line, RIJ today

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) now with hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved. Initially concern for hypovolemia, demand
   ischemia, and sepsis. Pressures discontinued yesterday around 5pm.
   Maintaining pressures very well. Good urine output.
       In terms of etiology, cardiac enzymes trended down; no indication
   of new reinfarction.
       In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still pending while
   WBC trending down. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources
   given instrumentation.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for biliary sepsis
   - Continue to monitor cultures
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs trending down (only LDH remains
   elevated). Has remained afebrile with minimal abdominal discomfort.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for possible biliary sepsis
   - Touch base with GI
 if okay, will advance diet as tolerated; also
   find out how long to dose antibiotics
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. Appreciate
   cardiology recommendations- the feel is that this is demand ischemia
   and not reinfarction. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Continue on ASA,
   plavix, heparin. When able to tolerate, will add on beta-blcoker.s
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - D/c heparin drip
   - Continue adding on beta-blocker when able to tolerate
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. Appears euvolemic at this time.
   .
   # HTN: As off of pressors for <24 hours, will hold BP meds at this
   time.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output. Will hold
   off on given fluid at this time given history of heart failure. Avoid
   nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely
   .
   # BPH:
   -          Continue to hold hytrin
   -          Foley in place
   .
   # Macular degeneration: Not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: prn bolus NS, replete lytes prn, adv diet as tolerated
   .
   # PPx: protonix, heparin SC TID
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line
   - Will d/c A-line, RIJ today
   .
   # Full code- confirmed with pt

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted for ERCP and developed hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for possible biliary sepsis and is being monitored for cardiac enzymes, white blood cell count, and liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as reinfarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the instrumentation during ERCP and the presence of biliary sepsis.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and WBC count suggest the possibility of cholangitis, which may lead to further complications if left untreated.
4. Renal complications: The patient's pre-renal azotemia and history of chronic kidney disease may increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent ERCP and possible biliary sepsis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or bowel obstruction.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent respiratory failure and need for oxygen therapy may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes continued antibiotic coverage for biliary sepsis, monitoring of cardiac enzymes, white blood cell count, and liver function tests, and close monitoring of his respiratory and cardiovascular status."

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension after undergoing ERCP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 57.1, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 334 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mg/dL. The patient's liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are elevated, suggesting potential liver injury.

The patient's medical history is significant for no known drug allergies, and they have received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, for suspected sepsis. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 1.34 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their hypotension, but they are responding to stimuli and have a normal heart rhythm. The patient's skin and neurologic examination are not assessed.

The patient's plan of care includes continued ICU care, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes suggest potential sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Liver injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury or worsening of existing chronic kidney disease.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis can lead to cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis can lead to respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory acidosis.
6. Infection: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis increase their risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and central line-associated bloodstream infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient's potential liver injury and coagulopathy increase their risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure their optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including CAD and CABG, and is at risk for cardiac complications. They also have a history of kidney disease and are at risk for acute kidney injury. The patient is experiencing mild crackles on exam, but their urine output is increasing, suggesting that ATN may be resolving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CABG puts them at risk for cardiac complications, including NSTEMI, ATN, and CHF.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's history of kidney disease and the presence of ATN puts them at risk for further kidney injury, including CRF.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis diagnosis puts them at risk for septic shock, organ failure, and death.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's presence of mild crackles on exam and their history of CAD and CABG puts them at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac disease and the presence of sepsis puts them at risk for neurological complications, including stroke and seizures.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment is that they have cholangitis, sepsis, NSTEMI, ATN, CRF, CAD, and CHF. The plan is to continue antibiotics for 10 days, monitor the patient's urine output and kidney function, and adjust their treatment plan as necessary. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and CKD, admitted to the ICU with hypotension after ERCP for cholangitis. He has been stabilized and is currently on metoprolol, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible biliary sepsis. His labs show elevated WBC and LFTs, but trending down. He has remained afebrile and is tolerating diet. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, and he is on telemetry and aspirin and Plavix.

Medical Complications:

1. Biliary sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of cholangitis, and the ongoing use of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam may help to prevent or treat this complication.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI, and his current EF is severely depressed (20-25%). He is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient has pre-renal azotemia, and his creatinine is elevated. He is at risk for further renal decline, and his urine output should be closely monitored.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, and his blood pressure should be closely monitored to prevent further episodes.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has mild mitral regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may increase his risk for respiratory complications, such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has cholangitis and may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient has an indwelling urinary catheter and may be at risk for urinary tract infections or other infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic regimen as needed.
7. Consider obtaining further imaging studies, such as an echocardiogram or a CT scan, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac and gastrointestinal status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TTE ([**2124-9-11**]): The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV cavity with
   severe global hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) for cholangitis and admitted to ICU with hypotension,
   now resolved.
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs still elevated but trending down.
   Has remained afebrile with no abdominal discomfort this morning.
   Appetite improving; asking for solid foods this morning. Able to
   tolerate jello and apple sauce last night.
   - Continue zosyn for possible biliary sepsis, likely for 14 day course
   (currently day 5)
   - Follow-up GI recs
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. No recent episodes
   of chest pain, hypotension. Cardiac enzymes trending down when last
   checked [**9-9**]. Heparin drip d/c
d [**9-11**].
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - Per cards recs, started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # CHF (systolic dysfunction): Per history, patient with EF 35% by
   previous TTE (date unknown). TTE on [**9-11**] with significantly reduced EF
   (20-25%) and
severe global hypokinesis
. Patient appears euvolemic by
   exam.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   - Unable to start ACE I given renal failure.
   .
   # HTN: Systolic BP down to 90s overnight, but otherwise hypotension
   resolved. BP well-controlled.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output over past 24
   hours. Will hold off on fluid at this time given severe systolic
   dysfunction. Avoid nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely; Foley in place
   .
   # BPH: Good urine output
   - D/c Foley
   - Restart hytrin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man admitted to the ICU with hypotension, cholangitis, and recent NSTEMI. He underwent ERCP and is currently receiving treatment for possible biliary sepsis, CAD, and CHF.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 122/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 57.1
* Hct: 30.1
* Plt: 34
* Cr: 4.5
* TropT: 0.82
* Glucose: 106
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.8/31.0/1.2, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 54/7/0.62, ALT / AST: 59/32, Alk Phos / T Bili: 532/2.5, Amylase / Lipase: 84/25

The patient's imaging studies show:

* TTE: Moderately dilated LV cavity with severe global hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue zosyn for possible biliary sepsis for 14 days
* Follow-up GI recs
* Continue to trend labs
* Continue on telemetry
* Continue on aspirin and Plavix
* Start metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
* Continue metoprolol as above
* Hold off on fluid at this time given severe systolic dysfunction
* Avoid nephrotoxic agents
* Continue to monitor UOP closely; Foley in place

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Biliary sepsis
* Cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation
* Infection or sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."
