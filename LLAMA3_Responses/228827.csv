You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [** **]. The patient received IV Diltiazem 10mg, IV Metoprolol 20mg, and 50mg PO metoprolol, as well as lorazepam 5mg and 500cc NS bolus. The patient's heart rate decreased from 130s to 80s on Diltiazem drip (15mg/hr) between 4p-9p, and spiked to 101.4°F this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 136/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving Diltiazem infusion at 15mg/hr and has been on the medication since 02:20 PM on [**2176-12-22**]. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 83 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate decreased significantly on Diltiazem drip, which may indicate a risk of bradycardia.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate spiked to 101.4°F this morning, which may indicate a risk of tachycardia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 136/67 mmHg, which may indicate a risk of hypotension.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 16 inspirations per minute, which may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's temperature is 101.4°F, which may indicate a risk of infection.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is receiving Diltiazem, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Nephrotoxicity: The patient is receiving Diltiazem, which may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's heart rate and blood pressure closely to detect any changes in cardiac status.
2. Consider adjusting the Diltiazem infusion rate to prevent bradycardia or tachycardia.
3. Monitor the patient's temperature and respiratory rate to detect any signs of infection or respiratory failure.
4. Consider performing a thorough physical examination to assess the patient's overall condition.
5. Monitor the patient's lab results to detect any changes in cardiac or renal function.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to prevent cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, or nephrotoxicity."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   60 y/o M s/p fall down and EtOH intox found to have comminuted
   fractures of the right tibia and the fibula.
   .
   # Afib/flutter with RVR: Patient with first ECG that looked like 2:1
   flutter and repeat after slowing down in ED that looked like A-fib.
   Likely RVR in setting of pain and EtOH intox as well as questionable
   intake of medications.  Patient is having difficulty taking PO
   medications and heart rate control was not acheived on the floor.  He
   does respond to both diltiezem and metoprolol IV.  As he was previously
   on metoprolol PO as outpatient will continue BB for AV nodal blockage.
   -Currently well rate controlled on dilt drip.
   -continue home 50mg metoprolol PO.
   - IVF PRN.
   -Holding anticoagulation in periop setting.  Likely can just start
   aspirin daily.
   -Continue to monitor for symptoms of withdraw/intox.
   -Pain control.
   -Per EP, would go for TEE/Cardioversion if rate control cannot be
   achieved with dilt drip.
   .
   # Ankle fracture: Needs to go to OR for ? staged procedure.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - pain management with IV dilaudid.
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Preop risk assessment: Patient needs the procedure for pain control

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a fall and was found to have comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and is being treated with diltiazem and metoprolol. The patient is also experiencing symptoms of ethanol withdrawal, likely due to his recent intoxication. He has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and is at risk for perioperative cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR increases his risk of perioperative cardiac complications. He will need to be continued on beta-blockade therapy to control his heart rate prior to the procedure.
2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is likely experiencing symptoms of ethanol withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other complications. He will need to be monitored closely and treated with benzodiazepines as needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen during the perioperative period, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding during the procedure. He will need to be monitored closely and transfused with platelets as needed.
5. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain from his fractures, which will need to be managed effectively during the perioperative period.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his fractures and his recent intoxication. He will need to be monitored closely for signs of infection and treated promptly if necessary.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate during the perioperative period, leading to respiratory failure. He will need to be monitored closely and treated with oxygen therapy as needed.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate during the perioperative period, leading to seizures, coma, or other complications. He will need to be monitored closely and treated promptly if necessary.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for several medical complications during the perioperative period. He will need to be monitored closely and treated promptly if any complications arise."

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) after a fall down and ethanol intoxication. He has comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.6°C (101.4°F)
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 136/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is receiving diltiazem 15 mg/hour IV and metoprolol 20 mg IV, as well as lorazepam 5 mg and 500cc NS bolus. He is also receiving hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 1.5 mg IV q2h.

The patient's physical examination is notable for ankle pain, tremulousness, and a warm, well-perfused extremities. His neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.9%
* Platelet count: 83 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes a history of ethanol intoxication, and his current medications include diltiazem, metoprolol, and hydromorphone.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and flutter
* Cardiac failure
* Myocardial infarction
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Pancreatitis
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia

The patient's risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications include his history of ethanol intoxication and his current atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR. His Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score is 0, indicating a low risk of perioperative cardiac complications. However, his cardiac status may require close monitoring and management during the perioperative period."

   # Afib/flutter with RVR: Patient with first ECG that looked like 2:1
   flutter and repeat after slowing down in ED that looked like A-fib.
   Likely RVR in setting of pain and EtOH intox as well as questionable
   intake of medications.   As he is currently in sinus and responsive to
   diltiazem will stick with CCB for now.  We will attempt to convert from
   drip to boluses after surgery.  Will first have to wean drip.
   -Currently well rate controlled on dilt drip. Will attempt to convert
   to boluses and then PO dilt.  [**Month (only) 8**] become moot point if patient

   .
   # ETOH withdrawl - Per patient the last drink was on [**2176-12-21**] in the
   afternoon.  ETOH level of 33 on 27^th AM labs.  Patient clearly
   withdrawing at the moment.  His elevated HR and pain are confusing the

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a fall and was found to have comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula. He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and was treated with diltiazem. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm and blood pressure of 136/67 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. He has a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F) and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

The patient has a history of ethanol intoxication and is withdrawing from alcohol, which is causing his elevated heart rate and discomfort. He is also experiencing pain from his fractures and is being treated with IV dilaudid.

The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a macrocytic red blood cell count, which is likely due to nutritional deficiencies. He is also at risk for alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis.

The patient has no risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications, but he will need to be continued on beta blocker therapy perioperatively to reduce his risk of cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR may persist or worsen, leading to cardiac complications.
2. Worsening of anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, hemolysis, or inadequate treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, hemolysis, or inadequate treatment.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his fractures, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient is at risk for hepatic dysfunction due to his ethanol intoxication and potential alcohol-related liver disease.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient is at risk for pancreatitis due to his ethanol intoxication and potential alcohol-related pancreatitis.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to his fractures, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
8. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to his ethanol intoxication and potential withdrawal syndrome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusions and medications as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's temperature and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain with IV dilaudid and other medications as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust his treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's pancreas function and adjust his treatment as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust his treatment as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological function and adjust his treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, was admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient underwent ORIF of the right ankle and was started on antibiotics, anticoagulation, and pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show a mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's ETOH withdrawal symptoms are being managed with CIWA, and the patient's pain is being controlled with Dilaudid PCA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient is at risk for developing withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Infection: The patient's ankle wound is at risk for infection, and the patient's blood cultures are pending.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF with RVR may progress to more severe arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of a recent surgical procedure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Nutritional deficiency: The patient's macrocytic anemia may be related to a nutritional deficiency, particularly B12 deficiency.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to ETOH abuse or anticoagulation therapy, and may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Ankle fracture complications: The patient's ankle fracture may not heal properly, leading to complications such as nonunion or malunion."

   Assessment and Plan:  60 yom with h/o ETOH abuse admitted with right
   ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and AF with RVR now POD 1
   s/p ORIF of right ankle.
   # AF with RVR: patient now successfully transitioned from diltiazem gtt
   to PO and has remained in NSR most of night.  14 beat run of isolated
   asymptomatic VT in setting of normal electrolytes likely do to
   combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with irritable myocardium.
   - rate control: PO Diltiazem and consider transitioning to 60-80 mg PO
   QID (max 360 mg daily), consider transitioning to B-
     blockade for perioperative mortality benefit
   - ETOH withdrawal: continue CIWA as discussed below
   - pain control: as discussed below.

   # ETOH withdrawal:  last drink on [**12-21**] now nearing 72 hours out
   anticipating withdrawal symptoms to subside throughout day, patient
   with decreasing CIWA requirements 15 mg over 18 hours
   - continue CIWA scale Diazepam 5-10 mg PO q 2 hour PRN.

   # Ankle fracture: POD 1 s/p ORIF right ankle
   - pain control: Dilaudid 1 mg IV q 4 hours PRN for pain control, will
   add PO pain medicines as CIWA requirement abate for
     improved long term control (has been receiving 0.5 mg q 2 hours)
   - anticoagulation: lovenox 40 mg SQ daily

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient underwent ORIF of the right ankle and is currently receiving treatment for AF with RVR, ETOH withdrawal, and pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to ETOH withdrawal and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Risk of further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, due to ETOH withdrawal and pain.
3. Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and PUD in the patient's medical history.
4. Risk of further anemia due to macrocytic anemia and nutritional deficiency.
5. Risk of thrombocytopenia due to ETOH abuse and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Potential for respiratory complications due to anesthesia and pain management.
7. Risk of further complications due to ETOH withdrawal, including seizures, hallucinations, and delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm closely.
2. Adjust the patient's anticoagulation therapy as needed to minimize the risk of bleeding.
3. Monitor the patient's pain management and adjust as needed to minimize the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Consider B12 supplementation to address the patient's macrocytic anemia.
5. Continue to trend the patient's platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
7. Consider transferring the patient to the floor when stable and able to tolerate medical therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  60 yom with h/o ETOH abuse admitted with right
   ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and AF with RVR now POD 1
   s/p ORIF of right ankle.
   # AF with RVR: patient now successfully transitioned from diltiazem gtt
   to PO and has remained in NSR most of night.  14 beat run of isolated
   asymptomatic VT in setting of normal electrolytes likely do to
   combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with irritable myocardium.
   - rate control: PO Diltiazem and consider transitioning to 60-80 mg PO
   QID (max 360 mg daily), consider transitioning to B-
     blockade for perioperative mortality benefit
   - ETOH withdrawal: continue CIWA as discussed below
   - pain control: as discussed below.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal:  last drink on [**12-21**] now nearing 72 hours out
   anticipating withdrawal symptoms to subside throughout day, patient
   with decreasing CIWA requirements.
   - continue CIWA scale Diazepam 5-10 mg PO q 1 hour PRN, may space to 2
   hours as requirements decrease
   .
   # Ankle fracture: POD 1 s/p ORIF right ankle
   - pain control: Dilaudid 1 mg IV q 4 hours PRN for pain control, will
   add PO pain medicines as CIWA requirement abate for
     improved long term control
   - anticoagulation: lovenox 40 mg SQ daily
   .
   # Anemia: macrocytic anemia in setting of ETOH abuse likely
   representing nutritional deficiency.  B12 level on low end of normal as
   suspected culprit.  Remaining Fe studies WNL.
   - consider B12 supplementation
   - continue to guiac stools in setting of anticoagulation and GIB [**1-29**]
   PUD in PMH

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, admitted with a right ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He underwent ORIF of the right ankle and was given antibiotics peri-operatively. He has been experiencing some bleeding around the surgical site, which is expected. He has also been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which has been successfully transitioned to PO Diltiazem, and has been in sinus rhythm most of the day. He had a 14-beat run of asymptomatic VT, which is likely due to the combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with an irritable myocardium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg. He is receiving hydration and has a normal fluid balance. His lab results show a mild anemia, likely due to ETOH abuse, and thrombocytopenia, which is likely related to his alcoholism. His electrolytes are normal, and his blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of infection due to the surgical site and the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Bleeding: The patient has experienced some bleeding around the surgical site, which may continue to occur.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced atrial fibrillation and a 14-beat run of asymptomatic VT, which may continue to occur.
4. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is nearing 72 hours out from his last drink, and may experience withdrawal symptoms.
5. Pain: The patient is experiencing pain due to his ankle fracture and may require further pain management.
6. Anemia: The patient has a mild anemia, which may worsen if not treated.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Nutritional deficiency: The patient's anemia may be related to a nutritional deficiency, which may worsen if not treated.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results.
2. Continue to provide hydration and pain management as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's arrhythmias and adjust anti-arrhythmic therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's ETOH withdrawal symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider B12 supplementation to treat the patient's anemia.
7. Continue to trend the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider nutritional supplementation to treat the patient's anemia."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by ethanol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient underwent an open reduction with external fixation (OR) of the right ankle fracture, and received antibiotics peri-operatively. He was started on anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C) at 17:00, which is likely a result of surgical site bleeding. His blood cultures were sent earlier that day, so no further cultures were repeated. His heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. His electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated temperature and the presence of blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his anticoagulation therapy and immobilization.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): DVT can lead to PE, which can be life-threatening.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Flare-Ups: The patient's AF may worsen or lead to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Wound Infection: The patient's surgical site bleeding and potential contamination can lead to wound infection.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain from the ankle fracture need to be managed to prevent pain-related complications.
7. Delirium: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and withdrawal can increase the risk of developing delirium tremens (DTs).

The patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and cardiovascular status. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and the patient's pain and withdrawal symptoms should be managed aggressively."
