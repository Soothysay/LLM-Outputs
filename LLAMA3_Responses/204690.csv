   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old  with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, now with some difficulty breathing,
   leukocytosis and non-anion cap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis - hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses
   -- hold IVF for now as to maintain MAP > 60
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
   -- f/u urology recs re: abx and effect on renal function (trend Cr)
   -- followup urine culture and blood cultures
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   2. Difficulty breathing- satting well on 3 L NC, could be [**2-18**]
   aggressive IVF hydration. Will monitor pt today, if continues to be
   afebrile, will consider 1x 10mg IV lasix
   3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis- HCO3 is 17 today,
   Cl 112
 likely all from NS, as > 4 L given.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's progress note, the patient, an 80-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for urosepsis, likely caused by the disintegration of an infected stone during lithotripsy. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been resolving with fluid boluses, and has a non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis likely related to the large volume of normal saline (NS) administered.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
* Heart rate: 68 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 cm, and her cardiac output is normal.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* A systolic ejection murmur radiating to the carotid arteries
* A JVP of 7 cm
* Normal lung examination
* No edema or calf pain
* 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 37.0%
* Platelet count: 185 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
* Sodium: 137 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.2 mEq/L
* Chloride: 112 mEq/L
* Bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamycin
* Fluid boluses as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg
* Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels
* Consideration of furosemide (Lasix) if the patient continues to experience difficulty breathing
* Monitoring of the patient's renal function and potential adjustment of antibiotic therapy based on creatinine levels
* Holding of coumadin and ASA until the patient recovers and is cleared by urology
* Holding of sotalol and lisinopril due to hypotension
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with SQ heparin

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypotension
* Thrombocytopenia
* Coagulopathy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from disintegration of an infected stone. She has developed difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. She is being treated with antibiotics and fluid boluses to manage her hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ failure and increased risk of mortality.
2. Difficulty Breathing: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, but she may require more aggressive IVF hydration and consideration of diuretics to manage her fluid status.
3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not closely monitored, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. Close monitoring of her CBC is necessary to determine if the leukocytosis is resolving or worsening.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's cardiac rhythm is abnormal, which may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she may require further management to maintain a stable blood pressure.
7. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of her renal function is necessary to determine if her kidney function is improving or worsening.
8. Infection: The patient's urosepsis may lead to a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which would require prompt treatment.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a large volume of fluid, which may lead to fluid overload and increased risk of cardiac complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
   -- f/u urology recs re: abx and effect on renal function (trend Cr)
   -- follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   2. Difficulty breathing- satting well on 3 L NC, could be [**2-18**]
   aggressive IVF hydration. Will monitor pt today, if continues to be
   afebrile, will consider 1x 10mg IV lasix
   3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis- HCO3 is 17 today,
   Cl 112
 likely all from NS, as > 4 L given.
   -- continue to follow renal function
   -- likely will resolve as approaches euvolemia
   4. Leukocytosis - -- monitor daily CBC, likely due to post-operative

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy. The patient is suspected to have urosepsis due to the disintegration of an infected stone. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving hypotension, but they still experience difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), a heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 94/48 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% on 3 L of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 7 cm and a cardiac output of 4.5 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, with a bicarbonate level of 17 mmol/L and a chloride level of 112 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is significant for mild chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a regular rhythm, normal rate, and normal S1 and S2 sounds. The patient's lung examination shows clear lung fields with good air movement bilaterally.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest urosepsis, which requires prompt antibiotic therapy and source control.
2. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient's laboratory results show non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which may be due to the large volume of normal saline administered. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored to ensure that the acidosis resolves as they approach euvolemia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to post-operative inflammation. The patient's complete blood count should be monitored daily to ensure that the leukocytosis resolves.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and they require close monitoring to ensure that it remains under control.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm, normal rate, and normal S1 and S2 sounds. However, the patient's history of cardiac disease and the potential for cardiac complications due to the urosepsis and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis should be closely monitored.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their urosepsis, non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and hypertension. The patient's cardiac status should also be closely monitored to ensure that they do not develop any cardiac complications."

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old Caucasian female, is admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy. She has a history of urosepsis from disintegration of an infected stone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/48 mmHg. She is receiving aggressive IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. Antibiotics have been initiated to control the source of infection, and blood cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but she remains at risk for recurrent sepsis and hypotension.
2. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which may be due to a lab error or a transient response to bacteremia/sepsis.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows an irregular rhythm, which may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, which may be a sign of underlying hypertension or a response to the sepsis.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications.
6. Bloodstream infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of bloodstream infection.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate underlying kidney disease or acute kidney injury.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to sepsis and pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive IV fluids to maintain a MAP greater than 60 mmHg.
2. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
3. Consider placing a central venous line (CVL) if the patient's hypotension persists.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust IV fluids accordingly.
6. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent bloodstream infection.
7. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust medications as necessary.
8. Consider intubating the patient if respiratory failure develops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely leading to urosepsis from disintegration of infected stone. The patient has been experiencing difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has been experiencing difficulty breathing, which may be related to dehydration and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFib-RVR). She is currently receiving oxygen therapy and has been given IV diuresis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has AFib-RVR, which is being managed with IV Diltiazem and Lopressor. Her blood pressure is being closely monitored, and she has been given small IV fluid boluses as needed to control her blood pressure and heart rate.
* Renal: The patient has been experiencing non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which has been resolved. Her electrolyte levels are being closely monitored.
* Hematological: The patient has leukocytosis, which has been resolving. She is being treated with antibiotics for urosepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty breathing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's AFib-RVR may lead to cardiac complications such as atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to renal failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis may worsen, leading to sepsis.
* Dehydration: The patient's dehydration may worsen, leading to further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IVF to maintain MAP > 60
* Antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
* Follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
* Tylenol for fevers
* Zofran prn nausea
* Small IVF as needed to control HR and BP
* Restarted Sotalol
* IV Dilt or Lopressor for BP control
* F/u Troponins, CK, CK-MB given concern for demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia
* Continue ASA
* Hold lisinopril and HCTZ given concern for hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, now with some difficulty breathing,
   leukocytosis and non-anion cap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis - hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses
   -- hold IVF for now as to maintain MAP > 60
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
   -- f/u urology recs re: abx and effect on renal function (trend Cr)
   -- follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   2. Difficulty breathing- satting well on 3 L NC, could be [**2-18**]
   aggressive IVF hydration. Will monitor pt today, if continues to be
   afebrile, will consider 1x 10mg IV lasix
   3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis- HCO3 is 17 today,
   Cl 112
 likely all from NS, as > 4 L given.
   -- continue to follow renal function
   -- likely will resolve as approaches euvolemia
   4. Leukocytosis - -- monitor daily CBC, likely due to post-operative
   inflammation.
   -- not on any meds that could cause BM suppression
   .
   #. Afib - coumadin has been on hold for procedure today
   -- holding coumadin until recovers and is ok'ed by urology.
   -- hold sotalol given hypotension
   -- restart ASA
   #. Hypertension
   -- hold lisinopril and HCTZ given hypotension

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely leading to urosepsis from disintegration of infected stone. The patient has developed hypotension, difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 127 bpm
* Blood pressure: 117/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130-140 beats per minute
* Hypotension with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg
* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL
* Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 17 mmol/L and a chloride level of 112 mmol/L

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count: WBC 7.1, Hct 37.0, Plt 185
* Electrolytes: Na 140 mmol/L, K 3.3 mmol/L, Cl 112 mmol/L, PO4 1.7 mmol/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT 16.1, PTT 37.6, INR 1.4, differential count: Neuts 71.0%, Band 11.0%, Lymph 4.0%, Mono 4.0%, Eos 0.0%, Ca++ 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.1 mg/dL, PO4 1.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Hold IV fluids for now to maintain a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg
* Antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
* Follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
* Tylenol for fevers
* Zofran prn nausea
* Consider 1x 10mg IV lasix if the patient continues to be afebrile
* Continue to follow renal function and monitor for signs of urosepsis
* Restart ASA and hold sotalol given hypotension
* Hold lisinopril and HCTZ given hypotension

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Urosepsis with septic shock
* Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis leading to acute kidney injury
* Atrial fibrillation with embolic complications
* Hypotension leading to organ hypoperfusion
* Leukocytosis with potential for bone marrow suppression

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of urological manipulation with lithotripsy, resulting in urosepsis, likely due to the disintegration of an infected stone. The patient has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (83-134 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 154/95 mmHg (103-154/113 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (14-25 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF)

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 7.1 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 145 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL (normal range: <0.01-0.1 ng/mL)
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient is receiving antibiotics for urosepsis and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The patient is also experiencing difficulty breathing, which may be related to dehydration and/or atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of urosepsis: The patient may continue to experience fevers, hypotension, and difficulty breathing, which could lead to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.
3. Electrolyte disturbances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia, may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Dehydration: The patient may continue to experience dehydration, which could lead to worsening of atrial fibrillation, electrolyte disturbances, and other complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty breathing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's urosepsis may lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, which could result in heart failure and other cardiac complications.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's urosepsis and dehydration may lead to kidney injury, which could result in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications and to adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely leading to urosepsis from disintegration of an infected stone. The patient has developed fever, hypotension, difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 154/95 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,810 mL of IV fluids, with a net fluid balance of 1,340 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient has leukocytosis, non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's difficulty breathing and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Renal complications: The patient's urosepsis and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can lead to acute kidney injury and increased risk of sepsis.
* Neurological complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can lead to increased risk of stroke and seizures.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IVF to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg.
* Antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin.
* Follow-up urine culture and blood cultures.
* Tylenol for fevers.
* Zofran for nausea.
* Re-started Sotalol for atrial fibrillation.
* Holding coumadin until the patient recovers and is cleared by urology.
* Re-started IV Dilt or Lopressor for blood pressure control.
* F/u Troponins, CK, and CK-MB given concern for demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia.
* Continue ASA."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis following lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown some improvement in her clinical condition. However, she still has some potential medical complications that need to be monitored and addressed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, which is curious given her clinical improvement. Her renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 33.8 mL/min. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia (potassium level of 2.7 mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia (magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL).

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with diltiazem. She also has a history of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and is being followed by urology.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not yet fully resolved, and she may still be at risk for further complications.
2. Kidney damage: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she may be at risk for further kidney damage.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Ureteral stent complications: The patient's ureteral stent may become infected or cause further complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition, due to her prolonged hospitalization and altered nutritional intake.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, and she may be at risk for further glucose fluctuations.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and be monitored closely for signs of sepsis. Her renal function should be closely monitored, and her electrolyte levels should be repleted as needed. She should also be monitored for signs of atrial fibrillation and have her ureteral stent removed as soon as possible. Her nutritional status should be closely monitored, and she should be provided with a balanced diet and supplements as needed. Finally, her glycemic control should be closely monitored, and she should be provided with insulin and other medications as needed to maintain euglycemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, here with atrial fibrillation in the
   120s-140s and difficulty breathing.
   1. Atrial fibrillation- could be due to intense diuresis/ dehydration
   stress as pt is 3L negative O/N.
   -- Increased sotalol from 80mg [**Hospital1 7**] to 120mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- IV lopressor 5mg as needed for rate control
   -- can consider IV diltiazem before dilt gtt
   -- correct w/ small boluses of fluid, 250cc NS over 15min at a time
   -- hold further diuresis for now
   -- consider starting dilt gtt if needed
   -- restarted coumadin as per urology recs
   -- ct ASA
   2. Difficulty breathing- could be [**2-18**] volume status, holding lasix for
   now. Can
t do albuterol nebs b/c pt is on beta blocker. Unlikely flash
   pulmn edema, given stable clinical presentation.
   3. Urosepsis
 WBC somewhat increased today, the patient is afebrile ad
   normotensive.  CXR unremarkable.  Pt complaining of dysuria upon
   voiding and a tingling feeling.
   -- U/A and UCx for possible UTI
   -- added Pyridium for urinary analgesia/ sx relief
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin (day 5 of a
   7 day total course)
   -- f/u urology recs
   -- f/u UCx if bug not sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add 3^rd [**Doctor Last Name **]
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   4. Electrolyte disturbances
   -- check PO lytes and replete K, Mg and Phos as needed
   6. [**Name (NI) 11388**] pt had SBPs in 180s-200s o/n and previously had home
   anti-HTN meds held d/t hypotension on initial arrival
   -- hold lisinopril 40mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120s-140s
* Hypotension with SBP in the 200s
* Difficulty breathing
* Fever
* Dysuria and tingling sensation upon voiding
* Increased WBC
* Electrolyte disturbances (K, Mg, Phos)

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Sotalol 120mg IV
* Lopressor 5mg IV as needed
* Diltiazem 10mg IV and 30mg PO QID
* Pyridium for urinary analgesia
* Antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamycin) for urosepsis
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis
* PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Zofran for nausea

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 36.4°C
* HR: 129 bpm
* BP: 113/57 mmHg
* RR: 19 insp/min
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 15.2 K/uL
* Hct: 35.2%
* Plt: 193 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: alert and responsive
* HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic
* Neck: supple, no LAD
* CARDIAC: irregular rhythm, tachycardic rate
* LUNGS: expiratory wheeze B/L, decreased air movement at b/l bases and bibasilar crackles
* ABDOMEN: NABS, soft, NT, ND
* EXTREMITIES: no edema or calf pain
* SKIN: no rashes or lesions
* NEURO: A&Ox3, appropriate, CN 2-12 grossly intact

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Atrial fibrillation: increased sotalol, IV lopressor as needed, and consider IV diltiazem
* Difficulty breathing: holding lasix, consider starting dilt gtt if needed
* Urosepsis: U/A and UCx for possible UTI, added Pyridium for urinary analgesia, and antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
* Electrolyte disturbances: check PO lytes and replete K, Mg, and Phos as needed
* [**Name (NI) 11388**] pt had SBPs in 180s-200s o/n and previously had home anti-HTN meds held d/t hypotension on initial arrival: hold lisinopril and continue HCTZ

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Respiratory failure due to difficulty breathing
* Sepsis or septic shock due to urosepsis
* Electrolyte imbalances due to medication or underlying conditions
* Renal failure due to hypotension or underlying kidney disease
* Worsening of underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, here with atrial fibrillation in the
   120s-140s and difficulty breathing.
   1. Atrial fibrillation- could be due to intense diuresis/ dehydration
   stress as pt is 3L negative O/N.
   -- Increased sotalol from 80mg [**Hospital1 7**] to 120mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- IV lopressor 5mg as needed for rate control
   -- can consider IV diltiazem before dilt gtt
   -- correct w/ small boluses of fluid, 250cc NS over 15min at a time
   -- hold further diuresis for now
   -- consider starting dilt gtt if needed
   -- restarted coumadin as per urology recs
   -- ct ASA
   2. Difficulty breathing- could be [**2-18**] volume status, holding lasix for
   now. Can
t do albuterol nebs b/c pt is on beta blocker. Unlikely flash
   pulmn edema, given stable clinical presentation.
   3. Urosepsis
 WBC somewhat increased today, the patient is afebrile ad
   normotensive.  CXR unremarkable.  Pt complaining of dysuria upon
   voiding and a tingling feeling.
   -- U/A and UCx for possible UTI
   -- added Pyridium for urinary analgesia/ sx relief
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin (day 5 of a
   7 day total course)
   -- f/u urology recs
   -- f/u UCx if bug not sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add 3^rd [**Doctor Last Name **]
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   4. Electrolyte disturbances
   -- check PO lytes and replete K, Mg and Phos as needed
   6. [**Name (NI) 11388**] pt had SBPs in 180s-200s o/n and previously had home
   anti-HTN meds held d/t hypotension on initial arrival
   -- restarted lisinopril 40mg daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily (outpatient
   meds)
   -- monitor BP, now in 160s

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, here with atrial fibrillation in the
   120s-140s and difficulty breathing.
   1. Atrial fibrillation- could be due to intense diuresis/ dehydration
   stress as pt is 3L negative O/N.
   -- Increased sotalol from 80mg [**Hospital1 7**] to 120mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- IV lopressor 5mg as needed for rate control
   -- can consider IV diltiazem before dilt gtt
   -- correct w/ small boluses of fluid, 250cc NS over 15min at a time
   -- hold further diuresis for now
   -- consider starting dilt gtt if needed
   -- restarted coumadin as per urology recs
   -- ct ASA
   2. Difficulty breathing- could be [**2-18**] volume status, holding lasix for
   now. Can
t do albuterol nebs b/c pt is on beta blocker. Unlikely flash
   pulmn edema, given stable clinical presentation.
   3. Urosepsis
 WBC somewhat increased today, the patient is afebrile ad
   normotensive.  CXR unremarkable.  Pt complaining of dysuria upon
   voiding and a tingling feeling.
   -- U/A and UCx for possible UTI
   -- added Pyridium for urinary analgesia/ sx relief
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin (day 5 of a
   7 day total course)
   -- f/u urology recs
   -- f/u UCx if bug not sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add 3^rd [**Doctor Last Name **]
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   4. Electrolyte disturbances
   -- check PO lytes and replete K, Mg and Phos as needed
   6. [**Name (NI) 11388**] pt had SBPs in 180s-200s o/n and previously had home
   anti-HTN meds held d/t hypotension on initial arrival
   -- restarted lisinopril 40mg daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily (outpatient
   meds)
   -- monitor BP, now in 160s

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, difficulty breathing, and urosepsis. She has a history of urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely causing the urosepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 129 bpm (with a range of 68-129 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/57 mmHg (with a range of 84-200/129 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-30 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120s-140s.

The patient has been receiving treatment for atrial fibrillation, including increased sotalol and IV lopressor. She has also been receiving fluids to help control her heart rate.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.1 K/uL (with a range of 4.1-15.2 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL (with a range of 9.4-14.1 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 185 K/uL (with a range of 107-193 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL (with a range of 0.5-1.6 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL (with a range of 0.01-0.1 ng/mL)
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL (with a range of 100-150 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: The patient is an elderly female who is alert, responsive, and has no acute distress.
* HEENT: The patient has no signs of trauma or bleeding, and her eyes are normal.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120s-140s, and her blood pressure is 113/57 mmHg.
* Lungs: The patient has expiratory wheeze and decreased air movement at both bases, with bibasilar crackles.
* Abdomen: The patient has no signs of abdominal distension or tenderness.
* Extremities: The patient has no edema or calf pain, and her pulses are normal.
* Neurological: The patient has normal sensation and strength throughout, with preserved reflexes and coordination.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated with increased sotalol and IV lopressor to control her heart rate.
* Difficulty breathing: The patient is being treated with fluids to help control her volume status, and she is being monitored for signs of respiratory distress.
* Urosepsis: The patient is being treated with antibiotics and is being monitored for signs of infection.
* Electrolyte disturbances: The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored and repleted as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty breathing can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ failure and death.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte disturbances can lead to life-threatening complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory failure.
* Kidney damage: The patient's urosepsis can lead to kidney damage, which can cause chronic kidney disease or even kidney failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is serious and requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Ectopy improved with stopping dilatiazem
   drip.  Increased sodolol, on po diltiazem. Rate adequately controoled.
   On ASA.
 NEPHROLITHIASIS (KIDNEY STONES): s/p lithotripsy and ureteral stent
   placement.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION:  Urosepsis in relation to the
   recent procedure.  On amp/gent.  Follow up on urine culture.  WBC
   trending down.
 DYSPNEA:  Secondary to component of fluid overload, improved with
   aggressive diuresis overnight.  Hold on further diuresis.
 HYPERTENSION:  Restart HCTZ.  Hold on restarting lisinopril for now.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman who presented with sepsis following lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. She has been experiencing fever and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 129 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which was controlled with stopping the dilatiazem drip and increasing the dose of metoprolol. She also has nephrolithiasis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, dyspnea secondary to fluid overload, and hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.1 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 185 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for anemia, and her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis progressing to septic shock
* Atrial fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest
* Nephrolithiasis causing further kidney damage or obstruction
* Hypertension leading to cardiovascular events
* Fluid overload causing respiratory distress or cardiac failure
* Anemia worsening to the point of requiring transfusion
* Infection from the ureteral stent or lithotripsy procedure

The patient's plan includes continued antibiotics, close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results, and management of her atrial fibrillation and hypertension."
