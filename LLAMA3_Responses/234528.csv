   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714    and CK-MB of
   19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute renal failure, and was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two balloon angioplasty (BMS) to the mid-LAD 90% stenosis.

The patient's condition is currently unstable, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and a troponin level of 80 ng/mL, indicating ongoing cardiac damage. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260 mmHg, indicating hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, troponin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating ongoing cardiac damage and potential kidney injury. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated, requiring insulin therapy.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which may contribute to his current condition. The patient's current medications include lopressor, lipitor, and atrovent, which may be contributing to his hypotension and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing cardiac damage may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory acidosis, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to further kidney damage, potentially requiring dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to further infectious complications, such as sepsis or septic shock.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further metabolic complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is unstable, and further close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications and optimize his outcome."

   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714  and CK-MB of 19
   -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.  Last night the
   radiologist from the OSH called and reported that the head CT he had
   there showed no bleed, but that the left maxillary sinus was completely
   opacified with thickening of the walls and soft tissue expanding into
   the cavity with a hyperdensity at the anterior aspect of the soft
   tissue.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. On cath,
   Fick CO 6.73, CI 3.20. Anatomy also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/
   robust collaterals.
   - daily ASA and Plavix
   - high-dose statin
   - lopressor TID, titrate up PRN
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves
   - Insulin SS for blood sugar control
   - Lasix boluses PRN
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).
   - cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
    #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Pt intubated at OSH for CO2 >100
   on ABG. The patient continues to remain CO2 on the ventilator.  The
   patient does not have a history of COPD, but had smoked in the past.
   - Ipratropium q6h
   - would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   - serial ABGs
   - Abx as above for pneumonia
   - Consider steroids for a possible COPD exacerbation
   - repeat CXR
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   -
   - Consider renal US to rule out postrenal causes of ARF.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.

   - Abx as above for pneumonia
   - Consider steroids for a possible COPD exacerbation
   - repeat CXR
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure (ARF). He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of two bare-metal stents in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient remains intubated and sedated, with a recent increase in his respiratory rate (RR) due to CO2 retention and acidosis on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated creatinine (1.4 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (29 mg/dL)
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) (14.5 K/uL) with a left-shifted differential
* Elevated troponin-T (1.24 ng/mL) and creatine kinase (CK) (714 U/L)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (106 U/L)
* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) (68 U/L)

The patient's medical history includes:

* Hypertension
* Diabetes
* Hyperlipidemia
* History of smoking

The patient's current medications include:

* Lopressor (metoprolol) 12.5 mg tid
* Lipitor (atorvastatin) 80 mg daily
* Lasix (furosemide) 20 mg IV q12h
* Fentanyl 75 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed) 4 mg/hour
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg daily
* Insulin sliding scale

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to STEMI
	* Heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure due to CO2 retention and acidosis
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis or contrast-induced nephropathy
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to diabetes and hypertension
4. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures due to hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalance
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to atherosclerosis or embolism
5. Infectious complications:
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration or hospital-acquired infection
	* Sepsis due to pneumonia or other sources
6. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes or stress
	* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy or other medications

Based on the patient's current condition, the following potential medical complications are considered high-risk:

1. Cardiac complications: Cardiogenic shock, heart failure
2. Respiratory complications: Respiratory failure, VAP
3. Renal complications: AKI, CKD

The patient's management plan should focus on:

1. Cardiovascular stability: Monitor for signs of cardiogenic shock and heart failure, and adjust therapy accordingly.
2. Respiratory support: Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Renal function: Monitor for signs of AKI and CKD, and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent further deterioration.
4. Infection control: Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of sepsis.
5. Glycemic control: Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511
   --> 714  and CK-MB of 19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8
   -->11.2.  Last night the radiologist from the OSH called and reported
   that the head CT he had there showed no bleed, but that the left
   maxillary sinus was completely opacified with thickening of the walls
   and soft tissue expanding into the cavity with a hyperdensity at the
   anterior aspect of the soft tissue.  The patient was weaned off the
   nitro gtt as his pressures decreased overnight.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511
   --> 714  and CK-MB of 19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8
   -->11.2.  Last night the radiologist from the OSH called and reported
   that the head CT he had there showed no bleed, but that the left
   maxillary sinus was completely opacified with thickening of the walls
   and soft tissue expanding into the cavity with a hyperdensity at the
   anterior aspect of the soft tissue.  The patient was weaned off the
   nitro gtt as his pressures decreased overnight.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)

   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. Subsequent to his admission, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was found to have a 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.

The patient's condition has been stable, with a peak creatine kinase (CK) level of 714 IU/L and a troponin level of 1.24 ng/mL. His cardiac function is being monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter, which has been removed today.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including beta-blockers, statins, and anticoagulants. His blood sugar levels have been controlled with insulin, and his electrolytes have been monitored and replaced as needed.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 104 mmHg. His oxygen saturation has been maintained at 96% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's neurologic status is stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12. He has been sedated and paralyzed, but his pupils are reactive to light.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.5 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 94 x 10^9/L, and a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his liver function tests are normal.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of STEMI and PCI may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's ARF and pneumonia may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, or pneumonia.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's sedation and paralysis may increase his risk of neurologic complications, such as delirium, seizures, or brain injury.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may increase his risk of renal complications, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and ARF may increase his risk of infection, such as sepsis, bacteremia, or pneumonia.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage, hematoma, or bleeding diathesis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may increase his risk of electrolyte-related complications, such as arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and his treatment plan is focused on managing his cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic status. However, he is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 PA CATHETER - STOP [**2190-12-30**] 09:15 AM
   R groin line removed and tip sent for culture. Pt extubated
   successfully in the afternoon.  Was wheezy on exam but mostly upper
   airway, treated with nebs.  MS [**First Name (Titles) 3347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3348**] but PCO2 okay.
   Sputum shows 4+ GPCs on gram stain.  Had elevated blood pressures in
   the 180s in the afternoon.  Got Labetolol 20mg IV, then Hydralazine
   10mg IV X 1, then nitro gtt.  BPs trended down to 150s-160s on nitro.
   At 1am was more tachycardic with HR in the 100s, got Metoprolol 12.5mg
   PO X 1 w/o significant improvement.  Pt responded well to Captopril
   12.5mg w/ SBP in 120s, off nitroglycerin now.
   Nurse noted at midnight that pt had a L facial droop after taking off
   face mask.  Speech garbled but coherent.  Neuro exam per covering
   intern
pupils equal, L facial droop with asymmetry of forehead.
   Diffuse muscle weakness upper and lower extremities, strong hand grasp
   and equal on both sides. Hyperactive reflexes with clonus of lower
   extremities bl.  Upgoing Babinskis.  No focal deficits
.  ABG checked
   for concerns for hypercarbia and was 7.44/40/73/28.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. He also had a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of two bare-metal stents.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is extubated and has wheezing and rhonchi on examination, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.
* Cardiovascular: He has a history of STEMI and underwent PCI with placement of two bare-metal stents. His creatine kinase (CK) levels peaked at 714 and are currently 644.
* Neurological: He has left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which is consistent with possible cerebral vasculature accident (CVA).
* Renal: He has acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.1 and urine output less than 50 cc/hr.
* Diabetes: He is being treated with insulin and metformin.
* Pneumonia: He has a right lower lobe pneumonia that is improving on Levofloxacin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of STEMI and PCI with placement of bare-metal stents increases his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes may be due to CVA, which can lead to further neurological deterioration, including stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury can lead to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.
5. Pneumonia complications: The patient's pneumonia can lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, and increase his risk of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment, including:

1. Respiratory support: The patient requires oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to manage his COPD exacerbation.
2. Cardiovascular management: The patient requires close monitoring of his cardiovascular status, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO), to detect any signs of cardiovascular complications.
3. Neurological management: The patient requires close monitoring of his neurological status, including neuroimaging studies, to detect any signs of neurological deterioration.
4. Renal management: The patient requires close monitoring of his renal function, including creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, to detect any signs of renal deterioration.
5. Pneumonia management: The patient requires continued treatment with Levofloxacin and close monitoring of his pneumonia, including chest X-ray and blood cultures, to detect any signs of pneumonia complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and a STEMI. He has undergone two balloon angioplasties to the mid-LAD with 90% stenosis and has been intubated since admission.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently intubated and on pressure support ventilation with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 40 mmHg, and pO2 of 197 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone two balloon angioplasties. His cardiac enzymes have peaked, and he is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose statin.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure has been trending downward, and he is currently off nitroglycerin. His systemic vascular resistance (SVR) has decreased, which is concerning for possible sepsis.
* Neurologic: The patient is sedated and unresponsive to voice. He has a right facial droop and asymmetry of his forehead, as well as diffuse muscle weakness in his upper and lower extremities.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count has risen to 14.5, and his differential is left-shifted. His creatinine has increased to 1.4, and his urine output has decreased.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current status include:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe pneumonia, and his sputum culture shows 4+ Gram-positive cocci. He is currently on Levofloxacin, but his pneumonia may not be fully treated.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased, and his urine output has decreased. He may require further diuresis with lasix, and his antibiotic coverage may need to be broadened if he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever.
* Sepsis: The patient's SVR has decreased, and his white blood cell count has risen. He may be at risk for sepsis, and his antibiotic coverage may need to be broadened.
* Right eye gaze and RUE weakness: The patient has a right facial droop and asymmetry of his forehead, as well as diffuse muscle weakness in his upper and lower extremities. He may have a right-sided stroke or a neurological condition that needs to be further evaluated.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, acute renal failure, and a STEMI. He is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, right eye gaze and RUE weakness, and may require further evaluation and treatment."

   lasix, and diuresed ~ 1.5L up to MN.  Echo showed LVEF 55%, no apical
   akinesis, mild symmetric LVH, Mild PAH.   Given continued wheezing, pt
   started on Prednisone 60mg PO and standing Xopenex.   O/n Sputum Cx
   noted w/ ASPERGILLUS SPECIES, rare growth. Significance of this is
   unclear.  Pt not on LT steroids.  Given recent AMI and concern for
   thrombus, pt was started on heparin gtt w/ transition to coumadin.
   Seen by speech and swallow, who recommended nectar thick, w/ pureed and
   crushed tabs.  Pt noted o/n to have L facial droop and on exam in AM w.
   LUE weakness, LLE weakness, w/ upgoing toes, thus concern regarding
   stroke.  Carotid U/S w/ 60-69% R ICA stenosis, 40-59% L ICA stensosis.
   Neuro consulted: ddx ICH, embolic stroke vs. TIA.  CTA of head/neck
   ordered, showing no ICH, no old CVA, b/l carotid stenosis. Goal SBP
   140-180 per neuro  Holding on Coumadin and heparin gtt for now.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute renal failure. He was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of two bare-metal stents in the mid-left anterior descending artery. He was also found to have a left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which is consistent with a possible cerebral vascular accident (CVA). The patient's sputum culture grew Aspergillus species, which is a rare and potentially invasive fungal infection. He is currently being treated with antifungal medications and is awaiting further workup and consultation with infectious disease and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspergillus infection: This rare and potentially invasive fungal infection can cause respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated disease.
2. Cerebral vascular accident (CVA): The patient's left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes is consistent with a possible CVA, which can lead to permanent neurological deficits and death.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for developing AKI, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and nephrotoxins.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and STEMI puts him at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and COPD exacerbation put him at risk for developing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antifungal therapy for the Aspergillus infection.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider imaging studies to rule out a CVA.
3. Manage the patient's blood pressure carefully to avoid further kidney injury and cardiovascular complications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if AKI develops.
5. Consider consulting with infectious disease and ENT specialists to further evaluate and treat the patient's Aspergillus infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider adjusting his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further evaluate the patient's left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure.
* He was diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the mid-LAD artery.
* He is currently extubated and has left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which is consistent with possible stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
* He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and is being treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
* He has elevated blood pressures and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.
* He has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is being treated with diuretics and other medications to manage his fluid status.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Stroke or TIA:** The patient's left-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and upgoing toes are concerning for possible stroke or TIA. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be necessary to determine the etiology of these symptoms.
2. **Hemorrhagic Conversion:** The patient is receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke or TIA. Close monitoring of his neurological status and laboratory values is necessary to detect any changes.
3. **COPD Exacerbation:** The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen if not adequately managed with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. **Acute Kidney Injury:** The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not adequately managed with fluid and electrolyte replacement, as well as medication adjustments. Close monitoring of his renal function and laboratory values is necessary to detect any changes.
5. **Diabetic Ketoacidosis:** The patient's diabetes may worsen if not adequately managed with insulin and other medications. Close monitoring of his blood glucose levels and laboratory values is necessary to detect any changes.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and laboratory values to detect any changes.
* Perform imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, to determine the etiology of the patient's left-sided hemiparesis and facial droop.
* Adjust the patient's medications and treatment plan as necessary to manage his COPD exacerbation, AKI, and diabetes.
* Consider consulting with a neurologist or other specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.
* Continue to educate the patient and his family about his condition, treatment options, and potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and acute renal failure. He was transferred to the ICU due to a STEMI, which was treated with two balloon angioplasties to the mid-LAD 90% stenosis. The patient also has a sinus mass and aspergillus in his sputum, which is a potential source of invasive aspergillosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which is consistent with a possible CVA, especially in the setting of a persistent NLF deficit.
* Asymptomatic CAD with a proximally occluded RCA and robust collaterals.
* Elevated BPs, which are being managed with antihypertensive medications.
* Mildly overloaded on exam with crackles, which is being treated with diuretics.
* Acute renal failure, which is being managed with continued diuretic therapy and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
* Diabetes, which is being managed with insulin therapy.
* Depression, which is being treated with Celexa.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Invasive aspergillosis, which can carry up to 50% mortality in ICU patients.
* Cerebral edema or hemorrhage due to the patient's left-sided hemiparesis.
* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, due to the patient's CAD.
* Renal failure, which can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
* Hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
* Hypertension, which can lead to complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy or hypertensive heart disease.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing antihypertensive medications to manage BPs.
* Diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload.
* Insulin therapy to manage diabetes.
* Antibiotic therapy to treat pneumonia and aspergillus infection.
* Anticoagulant therapy to prevent thrombosis.
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
* VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* DVT prophylaxis to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis, now extubated w/ resolved leftsided hemiparesis.
   #. COPD exacerbation/CAP
 Pt. w/ wheezes and rhonchi on exam
   consistent w/ COPD exacerbation.  Now w/ stable oxygen requirement (on
   2L).
   - Will start spirivia daily; continue Xopenex standing Q6h and
   Ipratropium q6h.
   - Continue levofloxacin for 3 more days for CAP (pt. had received 4d
   already)
   # Aspergillus in the sputum
Patient found to have aspergillus in his
   sputum, pt. also w/ sinus disease w. dehissence of medial sinus wall.
   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  Elevated BPs o/n.
   Mildly overloaded on exam, crackles.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%, symmetric LVH
   suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and diagnosed with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing two percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He also developed a left ventricular thrombus, which was treated with heparin and coumadin. The patient's sinus mass was found to be a soft tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, and was referred to an outpatient workup. The patient's neurologic findings, including left hemiparesis with facial droop, were found to be consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a previous neurologic injury, rather than an acute stroke.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspergillosis: The patient has Aspergillus in his sputum, which may indicate invasive aspergillosis. Further evaluation, including an induced sputum and a non-contrast chest CT, is recommended to assess for evidence of aspergillosis.
2. Sinus mass: The patient's sinus mass is concerning for malignancy and requires an outpatient workup, including a biopsy, to determine the cause.
3. CAD: The patient's STEMI and PCI may have caused damage to the coronary arteries, leading to long-term complications, such as angina or heart failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and further monitoring is necessary to assess for signs of worsening kidney function.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is not well-controlled, and further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
6. Depression: The patient is taking Celexa for depression, and further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure that his depression is being adequately treated.
7. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's ECHO shows evidence of diastolic dysfunction, which may increase his risk of heart failure.
8. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to his immobilization and the presence of a central line.
9. Wound infection: The patient's sinus mass and the presence of Aspergillus in his sputum increase his risk of developing a wound infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's Aspergillus sputum and sinus mass for signs of worsening infection or malignancy.
2. Perform an induced sputum and a non-contrast chest CT to assess for evidence of aspergillosis.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin dosing as necessary to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's depression and adjust his medications as necessary to ensure that his depression is being adequately treated.
7. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis, now extubated w/ resolved leftsided hemiparesis.
   #. COPD exacerbation/CAP
 Pt. w/ wheezes and rhonchi on exam
   consistent w/ COPD exacerbation.  Now w/ stable oxygen requirement (on
   2L).
   - Will start spirivia daily; continue Xopenex standing Q6h and
   Ipratropium q6h.
   - Continue levofloxacin for 3 more days for CAP (pt. had received 4d
   already)
   # Aspergillus in the sputum
Patient found to have aspergillus in his
   sputum, pt. also w/ sinus disease w. dehissence of medial sinus wall.
   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%,
   symmetric LVH suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.  No edema on
   exam.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and diagnosed with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with a 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two balloon angioplasty procedures. The patient also has a history of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and aspergillus in his sputum.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no signs of heart failure or respiratory distress. He is on oxygen therapy and has a stable oxygen requirement. His blood sugar levels are under control, and he is receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4-9.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.5-11.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 179-177 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30-32 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+ 140-145 mmol/L, K+ 4.2-4.5 mmol/L, Ca++ 8.7-9.1 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.1-2.3 mg/dL, PO4 3.8-4.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.02 ng/mL
* CK-MB: 71 IU/L
* ALT: 27 IU/L
* AST: 47 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 68 IU/L
* Amylase: 84 IU/L
* Lipase: 84 IU/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Invasive aspergillosis: The patient has aspergillus in his sputum, and the mass in his left maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.
2. Malignancy: The mass in the patient's left maxillary sinus is concerning for malignancy, and a biopsy may be necessary.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and PCI, and he is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and he is at risk for respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, respiratory distress syndrome, and pneumonia.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of stroke/TIA, and he is at risk for neurological complications such as stroke, TIA, and seizures.
6. Kidney complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and he is at risk for kidney complications such as chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Blood sugar complications: The patient has diabetes, and he is at risk for blood sugar complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Further evaluation and treatment for invasive aspergillosis, including a chest CT scan and sinus aspiration.
2. Biopsy of the mass in the patient's left maxillary sinus.
3. Cardiovascular management, including anticoagulation therapy and beta-blocker therapy.
4. Respiratory management, including oxygen therapy and bronchodilator therapy.
5. Neurological management, including monitoring for signs of stroke or TIA.
6. Kidney management, including monitoring for signs of kidney failure or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Blood sugar management, including monitoring for signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now).  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He was transferred to the ICU with a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent two balloon angioplasty procedures to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Aspergillus infection: The patient has Aspergillus in his sputum, which may be an invasive fungal infection. The ID team has recommended further workup, including sinus aspiration smear/culture, and treatment may be necessary.
2. Stroke/TIA: The patient has a left hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which may be consistent with a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). A MRI is recommended to further evaluate the patient's neurological status.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has received dye during the catheterization procedure, which may have contributed to AKI.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is receiving insulin therapy.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone two balloon angioplasty procedures. He is at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, which may be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin sodium
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Lantus
* Insulin
* Plavix
* Captopril
* Lopressor
* High-dose statin
* Metformin (held)

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 62 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 116/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 9.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 179 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 143 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Coarse breath sounds and wheezing on lung examination
* Left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes
* Mildly overloaded on examination with crackles
* Sinus disease with dehiscence of the medial sinus wall

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is recommended that he be closely monitored in the ICU for potential medical complications and that his medications be adjusted as necessary to optimize his care."
