   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   1. Tachycardia and hypotension: Patient initally hypertensive in the
   ED, and has been getting metoprolol and Hydralazine for hypertension.
   Now intubated, on sedatives, and hypotensives. Differential includes
   hypovolemia, medication effect, hypotension secondary to Afib with RVR,
   PE, MI, sepsis. Given that inital hypotensive episode was this morning
   in the context of a rapid heart rate in the 150s, Afib is likely
   etiology. However, given concern for LE thrombus yesterday which seems
   to have resolved, tachypnea requiring intubation, PE is on the

   resolving. Sepsis is possible since patient had a fever of 100.8 in the
   ED. However since admission patient has remained afebrile. It is
   reassuring that CSF results do not support infection.
   -continue heparin gtt empirically for PE
   -consider CTA this evening or tomorrow as renal function improves
   -obtain LENI of LLE (R negative)
   -consider echo
   -control atrial fibrillation with amiodarone gtt
   -start low dose po metoprolol for rate control. Wean up as BP
   tolerates.
   -rule out MI
   -rule out infection: obtain urine culture, follow up blood cultures,
   follow up CSF cultures
   -culture if spikes; consider antibiotic coverage. Would hold off for
   now given no localizing sources of infection.
   .
   2. Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for tachypnea in the ER.
   Currently with good O2 saturations on PS 5/5. Would favor extubation to
   avoid sedating medications that may be contributing to hypotension.
   -d/c Propofol
   -optimize for extubation

   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.9. Cr on admission was 2.0, down
   to 1.6 today. Would consider CTA tomorrow assuming renal function woudl
   improve further. However if becomes tachycardic or hypoxic, could
   consider CTA earlier.
   -obtain urine lytes
   -avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   .
   #. Seizures: Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed
   shows no seizure activity since admission.
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Disontinue Ativan 1mg IV BID
   -f/u neurology recs

   # h/o MCA stroke:
   -continue plavix, pravastatin per outpatient regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (LCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures. He was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. ABG shows a pH of 7.20, PaCO2 of 20 mmHg, and PaO2 of 80 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 107 bpm and blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg.
* Neurological: Altered mental status with ability to follow commands and respond to stimuli, but unable to speak or move.
* Renal: Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.
* Hematology: White blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, platelet count of 285 K/uL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1.

The patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's tachypnea, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation, PE is a possible diagnosis. The patient is being treated with heparin empirically for PE.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent seizures and a recent fever of 100.8°F in the emergency department. Although the patient's CSF results do not support infection, the patient is at risk for developing an infection.
3. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may increase the risk of developing an MI.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV, but may still be at risk for developing respiratory failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and further deterioration may occur.
6. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of recurrent seizures and may be at risk for developing another seizure.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and further episodes of hypotension may occur.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing heparin empirically for PE.
2. Considering a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) later today or tomorrow if the patient's renal function improves.
3. Obtaining a leg venous ultrasound (LENI) to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
4. Controlling atrial fibrillation with amiodarone and starting low-dose oral metoprolol for rate control.
5. Ruling out MI and infection by obtaining urine and blood cultures, and following up with CSF cultures.
6. Monitoring the patient's renal function and avoiding nephrotoxins.
7. Continuing the patient's anticonvulsant medication and following up with neurology recommendations.
8. Monitoring the patient's circulation and pulses in both legs.
9. Providing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension. Likely neurologic given primary
   presenting complaint AMS. Will obtain MR [**First Name (Titles) 1646**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11359**] stable.
   #. Tachycardia and hypotension
   Still in AF with some rate control of otherwise RVR with diltiazem PO.
   Pressures now better. LENIs negative and no little suspicion for PE
   would not explain seizure and AMS, and hemodynamic fluctuations not
   consistent with.
   -continue heparin gtt empirically for PE
   - Increase diltaizem to 45 mg QID (from 30 mg)
   #. AMS
   Likely brainstem stroke given possible emboli to left leg,
   hypertension, seizure, posturing of limbs. Not evident on CT but this
   was early and posturing of left arm more consistent with subcortical
   infarction. Therefore MRI with stroke protocol as above. Not likely
   that seizures are contributing given that these were not seen before
   and are typically motor.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications
   - NR as above when stable
   - Continue anticonvulsants
   - Restart EEG monitoring after MRI
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   # Acute renal failure
   Improving. Possible embolic now on heparin and improving. Versus
   prerenal with increased viscosity and dislodging of clot or increased
   clotting in small vessel. Possible component of etiology.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   -avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   #. Seizures
   Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed shows no seizure
   activity since admission. Continue Mx as above
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Disontinue Ativan 1mg IV BID
   -f/u neurology recs
   # h/o MCA stroke:
   -continue plavix, pravastatin per outpatient regimen
   - Determine full risk of using coumadin
   # Concern for hypoperfused RLE: R LENI negative. Vascular evaluated the
   patient and has signed off. Currently both LEs have good circulation
   and pulses.
   -continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension. Likely neurologic given primary
   presenting complaint AMS. Will obtain MR [**First Name (Titles) 1646**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11359**] stable.
   #. Tachycardia and hypotension
   Still in AF with some rate control of otherwise RVR with diltiazem PO.
   Pressures now better. LENIs negative and no little suspicion for PE
   would not explain seizure and AMS, and hemodynamic fluctuations not
   consistent with.
   -continue heparin gtt empirically for PE
   - Increase diltaizem to 45 mg QID (from 30 mg)
   #. AMS
   Likely brainstem stroke given possible emboli to left leg,
   hypertension, seizure, posturing of limbs. Not evident on CT but this
   was early and posturing of left arm more consistent with subcortical
   infarction. Therefore MRI with stroke protocol as above. Not likely
   that seizures are contributing given that these were not seen before
   and are typically motor.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications
   - NR as above when stable
   - Continue anticonvulsants
   - Restart EEG monitoring after MRI
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   # Acute renal failure
   Improving. Possible embolic now on heparin and improving. Versus
   prerenal with increased viscosity and dislodging of clot or increased
   clotting in small vessel. Possible component of etiology.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   -avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   #. Seizures
   Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed shows no seizure
   activity since admission. Continue Mx as above
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Disontinue Ativan 1mg IV BID
   -f/u neurology recs
   # h/o MCA stroke:
   -continue plavix, pravastatin per outpatient regimen
   - Determine full risk of using coumadin
   # Concern for hypoperfused RLE: R LENI negative. Vascular evaluated the
   patient and has signed off. Currently both LEs have good circulation
   and pulses.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Summary:**

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures. He presented with a witnessed seizure and altered mental status (AMS). The patient is intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He has a rigid and wasted right leg, left more flaccid, and upper limbs rigid with right greater than left.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of ARF. The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and he is receiving heparin therapy, which may improve his renal function.
2. **Stroke:** The patient has a history of left MCA stroke, and his current condition suggests a possible brainstem stroke. The patient's MRI with stroke protocol is pending to confirm this diagnosis.
3. **Seizures:** The patient has a history of recurrent seizure disorder, and his current condition suggests that he may be experiencing seizures. The patient is receiving anticonvulsant therapy, but the EEG monitoring is pending to confirm seizure activity.
4. **Hypoperfusion:** The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of hypoperfusion. The patient's right leg is hypoperfused, and the vascular evaluation has signed off on the patient's circulation.
5. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient is receiving heparin therapy empirically for PE, but the patient's clinical presentation does not suggest a high risk of PE.
6. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
7. **Infection:** The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of invasive lines and devices.

**Plan:**

1. Continue heparin therapy empirically for PE.
2. Increase diltiazem to 45 mg QID to control atrial fibrillation.
3. Hold sedating medications and continue to monitor the patient's mental status.
4. Restart EEG monitoring after MRI.
5. Continue anticonvulsant therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy accordingly.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust therapy accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which revealed an acute infarct involving the entire right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with a small amount of hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, and a 4mm right-to-left midline shift with near complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). The patient was previously on heparin and plavix, which were discontinued based on the MRI findings. The patient is expected to be made comfort measure only (CMO) in the morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/62 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a endotracheal tube and is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and a troponin level of 0.11 ng/mL. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of stroke symptoms: The patient's stroke symptoms may worsen due to the occlusion of the right ICA, which could lead to further neurological damage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the stroke, which could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of a central line and the risk of DVT and stress ulcer.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to renal failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the presence of a central line and the risk of stress ulcer.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a central line and the risk of DVT and stress ulcer."

   Imaging: MRI shows new stroke of right MCA territory with very small
   preserved cortex at midline.
   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension.
   Full right MCA territory stroke now, on top of previous left MCA. Only
   viable cortex supplied by anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral on
   right. No meaningful recovery expected, therefore need to discuss
   further with family, who wanted time to think about transition to CMO.
   He is presentely DNR/do not re-intubate.
   #. Discussion with family
   - Plan to meet with them again to determine whether to continue
   treatment or transition to CMO
   #. Tachycardia and hypotension
   Stroke team want BP to autoregulate at present.
   - If BP > 200 mmHg then hydralazine.
   - Keep rate controlled enough to prevent myocardial ischemia.
   - Stop anticoagulants given small hemorrhagic conversion
   #. AMS
   Secondary to very large cortical infarction now with great some of
   fractional loss of cortical function.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications
   - Continue anticonvulsants
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   - Discuss further with family
   # Acute renal failure
   Continues to improve. Versus prerenal with increased viscosity and
   dislodging of clot or increased clotting in small vessel. Possible
   component of etiology.
   - Continue maintenance fluids only for now
   - Avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   #. Seizures
   Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed shows no seizure
   activity since admission. Continue Mx as above
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male who has suffered a stroke involving the entire right MCA territory with small hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, resulting in a mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and a 4mm right to left midline shift with near complete occlusion of the right ICA. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has had recurrent seizures.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, indicating a severe altered mental status. The patient has a rigid and wasted right leg, a flaccid left leg, and is non-responsive to verbal stimuli.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm (normal range: 89-128 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/62 mmHg (normal range: 77-151/64-107 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-23 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 11.4 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 285 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.11 ng/mL (normal range: 0.00-0.04 ng/mL)

The patient's imaging studies show a large cortical infarction involving the right MCA territory, with some preserved cortex at the midline.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Stroke: The patient has suffered a severe stroke involving the entire right MCA territory, resulting in a mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and a 4mm right to left midline shift with near complete occlusion of the right ICA.
2. Seizures: The patient has a history of recurrent seizures and has had several seizures since admission.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute renal failure.
4. Tachycardia and hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is tachycardic.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has a severe altered mental status, with a GCS score of 3.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Further stroke: The patient is at risk for further stroke due to the underlying condition and the presence of atrial fibrillation.
2. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of recurrent seizures and is at risk for further seizures.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for further respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his altered mental status and the presence of indwelling catheters.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and sedation.
2. Monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate.
3. Administration of anticonvulsants to prevent seizures.
4. Management of acute renal failure, including maintenance fluids and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
5. Monitoring of cardiac status, including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.
6. Discussion with the family regarding the patient's code status and potential for transition to comfort care."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initially presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the
   MICU with tachycardia and hypotension and found to have full right MCA
   territory stroke with only viable cortex supplied by anterior cerebral
   and posterior cerebral on right. No meaningful recovery expected and
   family is in agreement with plans to transition to CMO. He is presently
   DNR/do not re-intubate.
   # Left MCA stroke. Likely etiology of patient
s seizure presentation
   and AMS secondary to very large cortical infarction now with greater
   loss of cortical function.
   - Plan to make CMO after formal discussion with family
   - Comfort measure only; start morphine drip
   - Continue supportive care for comfort
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with tegretol
   - Appreciate neurology, stroke, palliative care recommendations
   # Autonomic lability. Likely etiology of patient
s labile BP secondary
   to continued autoregulation.
   - Continue rate control prn
   - Continue fluid boluses prn
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation given small hemorrhagic conversion
   # A fib. Episode last night of a. fib with RVR that responded well to
   lopressor.
   - Continue rate control prn
   # Acute renal failure. Improving. Consider prerenal with increased
   viscosity and dislodging of clot or increased clotting in small vessel.
   - Continue maintenance fluids
   - Continue to renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   # Seizures. Likely secondary to new L MCA stroke.
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with tegretol
   # Concern for hypoperfused RLE.
   - Continue to monitor
   # FEN: Supportive maintenance fluids, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Boots only, famotidine
   # Access: PIV x3
   # Communication: Patient and daughter
   # Code:  DNR/DNI (discussed with daughter, family); will be made CMO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures. He was admitted to the MICU with tachycardia and hypotension and was found to have a full right MCA territory stroke with only viable cortex supplied by anterior and posterior cerebral arteries on the right. He is expected to have no meaningful recovery and his family is in agreement with plans to transition to comfort measures only (CMO).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is labile, with a range of 80s/40s to 116/75 mmHg. He has been bolused with 500cc of fluid to stabilize his blood pressure.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
* Neurological status: The patient is non-responsive, with only eye opening without fixation or movement on physical stimulation. He has no response to voice and is completely non-verbal.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results are as follows: white blood cell count 11.4, hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL, platelet count 285, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T 0.11.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Autonomic lability: The patient's labile blood pressure may continue to be a problem, and further interventions may be necessary to stabilize his blood pressure.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to be a problem, and further interventions may be necessary to control his heart rate.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, and further interventions may be necessary to support his kidney function.
4. Seizures: The patient's seizures may continue to be a problem, and further interventions may be necessary to control them.
5. Hypoperfused right leg and left upper extremity: The patient's hypoperfused right leg and left upper extremity may worsen, and further interventions may be necessary to improve perfusion to these areas.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged hospitalization and immobility.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to his immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk for malnutrition due to his prolonged hospitalization and inability to eat.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and further interventions may be necessary to manage his various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male who presented with a witnessed seizure and was found to have a large cortical infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. He has been in the MICU for several days with tachycardia, hypotension, and labile blood pressure. He is currently on comfort measures only and has been deemed DNR/do not re-intubate. The patient has been experiencing seizures, which are likely secondary to the new left MCA stroke. He has also developed acute renal failure, which is improving, and has been given hydralazine for labile blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFib) and labile blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's ongoing seizures and potential for further neurological deterioration may lead to increased risk of neurological complications such as status epilepticus, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebral edema.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis, increasing the risk of electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and cardiovascular complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and potential for further respiratory deterioration may lead to increased risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and tracheostomy.
6. Hemorrhagic Conversion: The patient's small hemorrhagic conversion may increase the risk of further bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and epistaxis.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of malnutrition, leading to decreased immune function, muscle weakness, and poor wound healing.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and potential for prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection, prolonged healing, and decreased quality of life.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities increase the risk of various medical complications. Close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team are essential to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left MCA stroke, and recurrent seizures. He initially presented after a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the MICU with tachycardia and hypotension. A full right MCA territory stroke with only viable cortex supplied by anterior and posterior cerebral arteries on the right was found. No meaningful recovery is expected, and the patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
* Heart rate: 160 bpm (tachycardic)
* Blood pressure: 107/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 65%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 265 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 11.4 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.11 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Sedated and comfortable appearance
* Pale and clearly hemiparetic elderly man
* Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
* Soft, non-tender, and non-distended abdomen
* Warm, well-perfused, and 1+ pulses in extremities

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Autonomic instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of autonomic instability, which can lead to further cardiovascular complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL suggests acute renal failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizures and recent MCA stroke increase the risk of further seizure activity, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest, if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 65% suggests respiratory failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent MCA stroke increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further complications.
7. Infection: The patient's history of stroke and recent MCA stroke increase the risk of infection, which can worsen if not properly managed.

Based on these findings, it is recommended to continue comfort measures only, continue morphine drip, and continue seizure prophylaxis with tegretol. The patient's autonomic instability should be managed with rate control prn and fluid boluses prn. The patient's atrial fibrillation should be managed with rate control prn. The patient's acute renal failure should be managed with maintenance fluids and renally dosed medications. The patient's seizure activity should be managed with continued seizure prophylaxis with tegretol."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures. He initially presented with a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the MICU with tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a full right MCA territory stroke with only viable cortex supplied by anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral on the right, and no meaningful recovery is expected.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate 160 bpm, blood pressure 107/63 mmHg, respiratory rate 7 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 65%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm with tachycardia.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,417 mL of fluids, with a balance of 902 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving mechanical ventilation, but is receiving oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 40%.
* Neurological status: The patient is non-responsive, with only eye opening without fixation or movement in response to physical stimulation. He has rigid and wasted right leg, left more flaccid, and upper limbs rigid with right greater than left.

The patient has the following medical complications:

* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 20 mEq/L.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm with a heart rate of 160 bpm.
* Autonomic lability: The patient has exhibited tachycardia and hypotension, which may be secondary to continued autoregulation.
* Seizures: The patient has had a seizure, and is receiving prophylaxis with tegretol.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue comfort measures only
* Continue morphine drip
* Continue seizure prophylaxis with tegretol
* Appreciate neurology, stroke, and palliative care recommendations
* Continue rate control prn
* Continue fluid boluses prn
* Continue to hold anticoagulation given small hemorrhagic conversion
* Continue maintenance fluids
* Continue to renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
* Continue seizure prophylaxis with tegretol

The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, with plans to continue supportive maintenance fluids, replete electrolytes as needed, and maintain NPO status."
