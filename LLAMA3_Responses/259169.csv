   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # SIRS/Septic Shock: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.
   Leukocytosis increased today to 35 with bandemia on admission.  Likely
   represent biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam, will add genta or ciprofloxacin for added
   coverage if patient decompensates
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - ERCP for stone extraction.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.
   - Decrease Tv to [**5-22**] ml/kg
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Secondary to obstructing stone.
   - ERCP for stone removal, will follow-up with ERCP team, will need FFP
   prior to procedure.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   - NGT/OGT placement today. [**Month (only) 8**] need to be IR guided or help from ERCP
   team.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K.  She also has a low normal fibrinogen in setting of
   acute illness, suggestive of relative deficiency.  Split products also
   elevated, all of which suggest that patient may be heading towards DIC
   even without low platelets.  Patient also may have a coagulopathy in
   setting of antibiotic use while on coumadin.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100

   # Anion Gap acidosis: Likely lactic acidosis with AG of 14 this AM.
   Likely secondary to lactic acidosis.
   - trend lytes
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient. INR this AM 2.1.
   - hold anticoagulation for ERCP, will need FFP prior to procedure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis is a significant concern, and the plan is to continue antibiotics, monitor fever curve and WBC, and consider adding genta or ciprofloxacin for added coverage if the patient decompensates.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's bilateral infiltrates and PO2/FiO2 <300 indicate respiratory distress, which may require further intervention such as decreasing TV to 5-22 ml/kg, and following up with ABG and sputum cx.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is secondary to an obstructing stone, and the plan is to perform ERCP for stone removal, followed by FFP prior to the procedure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, particularly in the setting of antibiotic use while on coumadin. The plan is to monitor DIC labs Q6H, and consider cryo if fibrinogen <100.
5. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis is likely due to lactic acidosis, and the plan is to trend lytes.
6. Afib: The patient's afib is a concern, particularly in the setting of coumadin use. The plan is to hold anticoagulation for ERCP, and consider FFP prior to the procedure.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern, particularly in the setting of sepsis and coagulopathy. The plan is to wean levophed with a goal MAP >65.
8. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL suggests possible renal insufficiency, which may require further monitoring and intervention.
9. Hepatic Insufficiency: The patient's elevated ALT and AST levels suggest possible hepatic insufficiency, which may require further monitoring and intervention.
10. Nutritional Deficiency: The patient's NPO status and lack of oral intake may lead to nutritional deficiency, which may require consideration of parenteral nutrition.

In summary, the patient's ongoing sepsis, respiratory distress, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, anion gap acidosis, afib, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, and potential nutritional deficiency are significant medical complications that require close monitoring and intervention."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with sepsis, pancreatitis, and respiratory failure. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking warfarin. She has a gallstone obstructing the ampulla, which is likely causing biliary sepsis/cholangitis. The patient is hypotensive and has a coagulopathy, with an increased INR and low normal fibrinogen. She also has an anion gap acidosis and is at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may progress to pancreatic necrosis, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.
5. DIC: The patient's risk of DIC is high, and if not properly managed, it may lead to life-threatening complications, including bleeding and organ dysfunction.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Afib: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further cardiac complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
2. Monitor the patient's pancreatitis and consider ERCP for stone removal.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider FFP and cryoprecipitate if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's DIC risk and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's anion gap acidosis and consider NaHCO3 therapy if necessary.
7. Consider holding anticoagulation therapy due to supratherapeutic INR.
8. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if necessary.

These are just some of the potential medical complications and recommendations for the patient. A more detailed and comprehensive plan should be developed in consultation with the patient's healthcare team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy, ? DIC.
   .
   # SIRS/Septic Shock: Hypotensive, on levophed with WBC 35 and bandemia.
   Likely biliary sepsis/cholangitis given gall stone obstructing ampulla
   on OSH MRCP.
   - Continue with amp/sulbactam
   - monitor fever curve, WBC count
   - CVL placement and bolus for goal CVP > 8
   - continue levophed
   - F/U Blood cultures, urine cx
   - ERCP for stone extraction
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion.
   - Currently on vent support
   - CXR s/p line placement and ETT
   - On unasyn for GI source which will treat aspiration pneumonia
   - Sputum cx from ETT
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Secondary to obstructing stone. Currently with [**Last Name (un) 1718**]
   score of 3 and 15% predicted mortality
   - ERCP for stone removal
   - IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis
   - Keep NPO
   - NGT/OGT placement today. [**Month (only) 8**] need to be IR guided.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K, but continues to have an increase in her INR.  She
   also has a low normal fibrinogen in setting of acute illness,
   suggestive of relative deficiency.  Split products also elevated, all
   of which suggest that patient may be heading towards DIC even without
   low platelets.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - FFP prior to ERCP, will discuss with ERCP fellow.
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100

   # Anion Gap acidosis: Likely lactic acidosis with AG of XXX this AM.
   - Recheck ABG and lactate this AM.
   - trend lytes
   - consider NaHCO3 for IVFs
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient. Now with supratherapeutic INR.
   - hold anticoagulation given INR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 91-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with sepsis, pancreatitis, and respiratory failure. She has a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and gallstone pancreatitis. She is currently hypotensive and on levophed support, with a WBC count of 35 and bandemia. She has a high risk of developing septic shock and DIC. She is also experiencing respiratory distress, anion gap acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, high WBC count, and bandemia increase her risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulopathy, elevated split products, and low fibrinogen suggest that she may be heading towards DIC, which can lead to bleeding and organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, high PEEP, and FiO2 suggest that she is at risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis, may worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of death.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis, secondary to obstructing stone, may worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of death.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, anticoagulated with Coumadin, may increase her risk of bleeding and organ failure.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, may increase her risk of stroke and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, WBC count, and coagulation parameters to assess the severity of her sepsis and coagulopathy.
2. Consider increasing the dose of levophed to maintain a blood pressure of 80-100 mmHg.
3. Continue to provide respiratory support with a high PEEP and FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Consider adding a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, to support the patient's blood pressure.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adding sodium bicarbonate to her IV fluids to correct her anion gap acidosis.
6. Continue to provide anticoagulation therapy, such as FFP and vitamin K, to correct her coagulopathy.
7. Consider performing an ERCP to remove the obstructing stone and improve the patient's pancreatitis.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider adding a sedative, such as midazolam, to manage her agitation.
9. Consider adding a diuretic, such as furosemide, to manage her fluid overload.
10. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider adding an antipyretic, such as acetaminophen, to manage her fever."

   [**Age over 90 **]F transferred from OSH with septic shock from biliary source,
   subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation; remains
   critically ill with hemodynamic instability; plans to undergo ERCP this
   morning.
   1) Septic Shock:  Currently requiring levophed for hemodynamic support,
   she has metabolic acidosis with lactate of 2.5.  Currently cultures are
   pending; abdominal imaging at OSH with biliary stone.
   - Continue unasyn; will consider addition of quinolone or gentamicin if
   clinical deterioration.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics
   - CVP currently 13, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   - Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure:  hypoxemic failure related to aspiration
   event.  PaO2 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 .60.
   - Will titrate PEEP today to decrease FiO2 following ERCP.
   - Also given aspiration event and sepsis, also P/F < 200, will place on
   low tidal volume ventilation 6-8cc/kg Vt to prevent VILI.
   3) Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, DIC given
   elevated INR.
   - follow coags, fibrinogen today; no indication for replacement
   currently (fibrinogen 169)
   4) Pancreatitis:  Amylase/Lipase trending down from OSH
   - will monitor fluid balance, recognizing risk of third spacing.

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for biliary sepsis, which has progressed to septic shock. The patient has undergone intubation due to an aspiration event and is currently receiving vasopressors for hemodynamic support. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is likely to cause organ dysfunction, which may manifest as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or coagulopathy.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, requiring further vasopressor support or even cardiac arrest.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, requiring further interventions to correct the acid-base imbalance.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics and awaiting culture results to tailor antibiotic therapy.
2. Monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status and adjusting vasopressor support as needed.
3. Planning for ERCP to relieve the biliary obstruction.
4. Titrating PEEP to decrease FiO2 and placing the patient on low tidal volume ventilation to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
5. Monitoring the patient's coagulation status and fibrinogen levels.
6. Monitoring the patient's fluid balance and recognizing the risk of third spacing.
7. Providing prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F transferred from OSH with septic shock from biliary source,
   subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation; remains
   critically ill with hemodynamic instability; plans to undergo ERCP this
   morning.
   1) Septic Shock:  Currently requiring levophed for hemodynamic support,
   she has metabolic acidosis with lactate of 2.5.  Currently cultures are
   pending; abdominal imaging at OSH with biliary stone.
   - Continue unasyn; will consider addition of quinolone or gentamicin if
   clinical deterioration.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics
   - CVP currently 13, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   - Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure:  hypoxemic failure related to aspiration
   event.  PaO2 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 .60.
   - Will titrate PEEP today to decrease FiO2 following ERCP.
   - Also given aspiration event and sepsis, also P/F < 200, will place on
   low tidal volume ventilation 6-8cc/kg Vt to prevent VILI.
   3) Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, DIC given
   elevated INR.
   - follow coags, fibrinogen today; no indication for replacement
   currently (fibrinogen 169)
   4) Pancreatitis:  Amylase/Lipase trending down from OSH
   - will monitor fluid balance, recognizing risk of third spacing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis, septic shock, and aspiration event requiring intubation. The patient is currently receiving vasopressors and has a central line in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/74 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a number of laboratory results that are concerning, including:

* Metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 2.5 mmol/L
* Elevated white blood cell count (32.4 K/uL)
* Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (68 mg/dL)
* Elevated troponin-T level (0.02 ng/mL)
* Elevated D-dimer level (5051 ng/mL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (486 IU/L)

The patient's radiology results include a chest X-ray showing bibasilar hazy opacities with effusion and evidence of consolidation or atelectasis at the right base.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics (Unasyn) and awaiting culture results to tailor antibiotic therapy
* Planning for ERCP today to relieve obstruction
* Titrating PEEP to decrease FiO2 following ERCP
* Placing on low tidal volume ventilation (6-8cc/kg Vt) to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
* Monitoring coagulation parameters and following coags, fibrinogen, and INR today
* Monitoring fluid balance and recognizing risk of third spacing
* Providing nutrition support with a current NPO status
* Maintaining glycemic control with insulin sliding scale
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or cardiovascular instability)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Pneumonia-related respiratory failure
* Pancreatitis-related complications (e.g., pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or secondary infections)
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding or thrombosis
* Metabolic acidosis-related complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, or coma)
* Hypoxemic failure-related respiratory failure
* Aspiration-related respiratory failure
* Biliary sepsis-related septic shock
* Obstruction-related complications (e.g., cholangitis, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis)"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F transferred from OSH with septic shock from biliary source,
   subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation; remains
   critically ill with hemodynamic instability; plans to undergo ERCP this
   morning.
   1) Septic Shock:  Currently requiring levophed for hemodynamic support,
   she has metabolic acidosis with lactate of 2.5.  Currently cultures are
   pending; abdominal imaging at OSH with biliary stone.
   - Continue unasyn; will consider addition of quinolone or gentamicin if
   clinical deterioration.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics
   - CVP currently 13, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   - Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure:  hypoxemic failure related to aspiration
   event.  PaO2 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 .60.
   - Will titrate PEEP today to decrease FiO2 following ERCP.
   - Also given aspiration event and sepsis, also P/F < 200, will place on
   low tidal volume ventilation 6-8cc/kg Vt to prevent VILI.
   3) Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, DIC given
   elevated INR.
   - follow coags, fibrinogen today; no indication for replacement
   currently (fibrinogen 169)
   4) Pancreatitis:  Amylase/Lipase trending down from OSH
   - will monitor fluid balance, recognizing risk of third spacing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for septic shock due to biliary sepsis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including central line placement, intubation, and vasopressor support.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic instability: requiring increasing doses of vasopressors
* Respiratory failure: hypoxemic failure related to aspiration event, with PaO2 of 84 on PEEP 8 and FiO2 of 0.60
* Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, and DIC, with an elevated INR
* Pancreatitis: trending down from OSH, with amylase/lipase levels decreasing
* Metabolic acidosis: with a lactate level of 2.5

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening septic shock: leading to further hemodynamic instability and potential organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure: potentially progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure
* Coagulopathy: potentially leading to bleeding or hematoma formation
* Pancreatitis: potentially worsening to acute pancreatitis or pancreatic necrosis
* Metabolic acidosis: potentially leading to further organ dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics and await culture results to tailor antibiotic therapy
* Monitor for fluid responsiveness and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
* Titrate PEEP to decrease FiO2 following ERCP
* Place on low tidal volume ventilation to prevent VILI
* Monitor coagulation parameters and fibrinogen levels
* Monitor fluid balance and pancreatic enzymes to prevent third spacing and pancreatitis progression
* Continue insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - RSBI this AM deferred.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin and smear.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year old female with a significant medical history, including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and a recent ERCP procedure. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral infiltrates and a PO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300, indicating respiratory failure. The patient has also aspirated in the setting of central venous line (CVL) insertion, which may have contributed to the development of bilateral infiltrates. The patient's sputum culture revealed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a secondary infection.

The patient's sepsis is likely biliary in origin, given the gallstone pancreatitis and successful ERCP procedure. Blood cultures from the operating room (OSH) speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli, and the patient is currently receiving antibiotics.

The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, with a platelet count of 84 and a fibrinogen level in the 300s. The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, and DIC labs are being monitored every 6 hours.

The patient's acidosis is likely a combination of metabolic and non-gap acidosis, with an anion gap of 10. The patient's lactate level is elevated, and an ABG with lactate will be checked later today.

The patient's anemia is concerning, with a hematocrit (Hct) of 25.6, down from 29.3 on admission. The patient may have a dilutional component to the anemia, although the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is within normal limits.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being held, and the patient's anticoagulation medication is being discontinued.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Coagulopathy-related bleeding or thrombosis.
3. Acidosis-related metabolic derangements, such as hyperkalemia or hypophosphatemia.
4. Anemia-related cardiovascular instability or bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure-related need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Pancreatitis-related pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
7. Central venous line-related infection or thrombosis.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is currently receiving ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - RSBI this AM deferred.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin and smear.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
   .
   # PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV, a-line, CVL
   .
   # CODE: Full for now per family
   .
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 310**] [**Name (NI) 1717**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1719**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - RSBI this AM deferred.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin and smear.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including:

1. Pancreatitis with gallstone pancreatitis and sepsis
2. Respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates and PO2/FiO2 <300
3. Coagulopathy with anticoagulation on coumadin, low platelet count, and elevated D-dimer
4. Acidosis with metabolic acidosis and anion gap
5. Anemia with Hct 25.6 from 29.3 on admission
6. Afib on coumadin as outpatient
7. CAD with holding ASA and lisinopril
8. Hx of CVA with no residual deficits and holding ASA
9. FEN with NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
10. PPX with SCDs, bowel regimen
11. Access with PIV, a-line, and CVL

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation
2. Respiratory failure, including worsening hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis
3. Coagulopathy, including bleeding, thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation
4. Acidosis, including worsening metabolic acidosis, anion gap, and potential for cardiac arrhythmias
5. Anemia, including worsening hypoxia, fatigue, and potential for cardiac arrhythmias
6. Afib, including worsening arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and potential for stroke
7. CAD, including worsening angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure
8. Hx of CVA, including worsening neurologic deficits, stroke, and potential for hemorrhagic conversion
9. FEN, including worsening electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and potential for cardiac arrhythmias
10. PPX, including worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potential for mortality

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these complications to prevent further deterioration and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - Lighten sedation and assess neuro status.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   - Decrease FiO2 as PaO2 was 151
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
   .
   # PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV, a-line, CVL
   .
   # CODE: Full for now per family

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 90+ year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
* She underwent ERCP yesterday and had a successful stone removal and stent placement.
* She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
* Her blood cultures from OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
* She has a history of coagulopathy and is receiving FFP and vitamin K.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's sepsis is likely biliary in origin, given the gallstone pancreatitis and successful ERCP. She requires continued monitoring of her fever curve and WBC count, as well as weaning of levophed with a goal MAP > 65.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration in the setting of CVL insertion. She requires continued mechanical ventilation with a focus on weaning and improving her oxygenation.
3. **Pancreatitis:** The patient's pancreatitis is likely to continue to cause transaminase elevation and lipase increase. She requires continued monitoring of her lipase and LFTs, as well as PRN IVFs to manage probable third spacing.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue to require management with FFP and vitamin K. Her platelets are trending down, and she requires continued monitoring of her coagulation status.
5. **Acidosis:** The patient's acidosis is likely due to a combination of gap and non-gap acidosis. She requires continued monitoring of her ABG and lactate levels.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is likely due to a dilutional component, although her LDH is WNL. She requires continued monitoring of her haptoglobin and Hct levels.
7. **Cardiovascular Status:** The patient's cardiovascular status is complicated by her atrial fibrillation and history of CAD. She requires continued monitoring of her cardiovascular status and management of her anticoagulation.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, acidosis, anemia, and cardiovascular status.
* Wean levophed and improve oxygenation.
* Continue to manage the patient's coagulation status with FFP and vitamin K.
* Monitor the patient's acidosis and anemia, and manage accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and manage her anticoagulation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with biliary obstruction and cholangitis. She underwent ERCP with stent placement for an obstructing stone and was found to have ecoli bacteremia, which is pansensitive to Unasyn. She remains in vasodilatory septic shock requiring levophed support and is on ventilatory support for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her condition has been stable over the last 24 hours, with maintained urine output and improvement in lactic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's continued vasodilatory septic shock and leukocytosis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, likely related to coumadin and possible early DIC, may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's biliary obstruction may lead to further complications, such as cholangitis or pancreatitis, if the stent becomes occluded or dislodged.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's continued vasodilatory septic shock may lead to further hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output.
6. Infection: The patient's ecoli bacteremia may lead to further infection, including sepsis, if not adequately treated with antibiotics.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's biliary obstruction may lead to malnutrition if enteral feeds are not restarted or if the patient is not able to tolerate oral nutrition.
8. Psychological complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and critical illness may lead to psychological complications, including anxiety, depression, and delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female admitted with biliary obstruction and cholangitis, who underwent ERCP with stent placement for an obstructing stone. She has been treated with antibiotics tailored to Unasyn, but continues to exhibit hemodynamic instability with stable pressor requirement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.9°C, Tcurrent of 36.2°C, HR of 92 bpm, BP of 83/54 mmHg, RR of 24 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 95%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 10 mmHg, and she has maintained urine output with improvement in lactic acidosis.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 33.4 - 24.8 K/uL
* Hct: 29.8 - 25.6%
* Plt: 136 - 84
* Cr: 1.2 mg/dL
* TCO2: 15 - 18 mmol/L
* Glucose: 68 - 47 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.1/40.4/1.4, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 131/5/0.02, ALT / AST: 107/159, Alk Phos / T Bili: 106/0.6, Amylase / Lipase: 145/26, Differential-Neuts: 86.0%, Band: 11.0%, Lymph: 3.0%, Mono: 0.0%, Eos: 0.0%, D-dimer: 5862 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 387 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.6 g/dL, LDH: 243 IU/L, Ca++: 7.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued sepsis and bacteremia, which can lead to organ failure and increased mortality
* Hemodynamic instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or stroke
* Respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest or prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Renal failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease
* Hepatic failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased mortality
* Neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy, which can be caused by sepsis, bacteremia, or medication toxicity
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, which can be caused by sepsis, bacteremia, or medication toxicity
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure, which can be caused by sepsis, bacteremia, or medication toxicity

The patient's critical illness and ongoing medical complications require close monitoring and management by the ICU team to prevent and treat potential complications, and to optimize her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with biliary obstruction and cholangitis, who underwent ERCP with stent placement for an obstructing stone. She has been treated with antibiotics tailored to pansensitive ecoli and has continued hemodynamic instability requiring pressor support. Her condition has remained stable over the last 24 hours, with evidence of adequate perfusion and improvement in lactic acidosis. She is currently intubated and receiving ventilatory support for hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing sepsis and bacteremia may lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support or extrusion.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy related to coumadin and possible early DIC may lead to bleeding complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's biliary obstruction and cholangitis may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, including pancreatitis, bowel ischemia, or perforation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ongoing sepsis and bacteremia may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's ongoing vasopressor support and sepsis may lead to cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's ongoing sepsis and bacteremia may lead to neurological complications, including seizures, encephalopathy, or meningitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust vasopressor support as needed.
2. Continue to provide ventilatory support for hypoxemic respiratory failure and consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider transfusion of cryo or fibrinogen if necessary.
4. Follow LFTs and bilirubin levels to monitor the patient's biliary obstruction and cholangitis.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a higher-level care facility if her condition worsens or if she requires more advanced medical interventions.
6. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and review the need for restraints regularly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to gallstone pancreatitis and biliary sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates and PO2/FiO2 < 300, which can lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of anticoagulation with coumadin and has received FFP and vitamin K, which can lead to bleeding complications.
4. Acidosis: The patient has a history of acidosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is taking anticoagulation therapy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient has a history of kidney disease and is at risk for renal failure due to sepsis and other underlying medical conditions.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis and other complications if not managed properly.
9. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient has sepsis, which can lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and decreased cardiac function.
10. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of afib and is at risk for neurological complications such as stroke and seizures.

The patient's current condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.
   .
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding lisinopril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.
   .
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   - Cont ASA

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 90+ year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. She has undergone ERCP and has been treated with antibiotics, but remains critically ill.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, and she is on CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a Vt of 350 mL and RR of 24.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis trending down, with a WBC count of 23.1 K/μL
* Anemia, with a Hct of 24.2%
* Coagulopathy, with an INR of 1.1 and a fibrinogen level of 339 mg/dL
* Elevated lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L
* Elevated D-dimer level of 5367 ng/mL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continue amp/sulbactam for a total of 14 days
* Monitor fever curve and WBC count
* Follow up blood and urine cultures
* Monitor UOP, MAP, and CVP, and bolus as necessary
* Set goal balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary
* Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness
* Assess mental status
* Consult ENT if blood in oropharynx persists
* Transfuse 1u PRBC and recheck post-transfusion Hct
* Start TF today
* Trend coags with AML
* Hold anticoagulation
* Continue ASA

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Anemia and bleeding
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis
* Acidosis and electrolyte imbalance
* Atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias
* Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure

These complications can be managed by closely monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition, and adjusting the medical plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and has received various treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and blood products.

The patient's condition is stable, with her levophed requirement decreased to 0.03 and her MAP stable at 65-70 mmHg. Her WBC count is trending down, and her lactate level is 1.7 mmol/L, suggesting that her sepsis is improving. However, she remains at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure and coagulopathy.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral infiltrates and a PO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300. She has been receiving prn sedation and is currently minimally responsive. A SBT/PS trial is planned for today to assess her responsiveness.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to antibiotic administration, and she has received FFP and vitamin K to correct her INR. Her platelet count is stable at 80, and her fibrinogen level is 339 mg/dL. However, her D-dimer level remains elevated, and she has been restarted on heparin.

The patient's acidosis has resolved, and her most recent pH is 7.37. However, she remains at risk for anemia, with a current Hct of 24.2. She has been transfused with 1 unit of PRBC, and her post-transfusion Hct will be rechecked.

The patient's anticoagulation therapy has been held, and she is being monitored for bleeding complications. Her ASA and lisinopril have been held, and she is being repleted with IVFs as necessary.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and she may require further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to antibiotic administration, and she may require further treatment with FFP or cryoprecipitate.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and she may require further transfusions or erythropoietin therapy.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, and she may require further antibiotics or other treatments.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, and she may require further treatment with IVFs or other medications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is concerning, and she may require further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or coronary angioplasty.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is concerning, and she may require further interventions, such as neuroimaging or neurosurgery.

In summary, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history and multiple ongoing medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.
   .
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding lisinopril
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, given the presence of bacteria in the blood cultures and the patient's continued febrile response. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, which may indicate a response to antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, given the presence of blood in the oropharynx and the patient's continued need for mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, which may indicate a need for further respiratory support.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue, given the patient's continued blood loss and the lack of significant blood transfusion. The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.1 g/dL, which is low and may indicate a need for further transfusion.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, given the patient's continued bleeding and the lack of significant improvement in coagulation parameters. The patient's platelet count is 80, which is low and may indicate a need for further transfusion.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely to continue, given the patient's continued abdominal pain and the lack of significant improvement in pancreatic enzymes. The patient's lipase level is WNL, which may indicate a need for further treatment.
6. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely to continue, given the patient's continued respiratory failure and the lack of significant improvement in acid-base parameters. The patient's pH is 7.34, which is slightly acidic and may indicate a need for further treatment.

The patient's medical history is significant for afib, gallstone pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient's current medications include coumadin, lisinopril, and ASA.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a thin, elderly female with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's neurological examination is significant for a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10, with the patient opening her eyes and moving all four extremities.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for a white blood cell count of 30.1 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 80 x 10^9/L. The patient's coagulation parameters are significant for an international normalized ratio (INR) of 13.2, a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 33.6 seconds, and a fibrinogen level of 339 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies are significant for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, which showed a gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's microbiology results are significant for a blood culture that grew pan-sensitive E. coli.

Based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory results, the patient's potential medical complications include sepsis, respiratory failure, anemia, coagulopathy, pancreatitis, and acidosis. The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and further evaluation and management of the patient's pancreatitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - When patient is off levophed, will set goal balance at -1000cc and
   diurese as necessary.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are noted:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is trending down, but the patient remains at risk for further complications. The patient has a high lactate level (1.7 mmol/L) and is receiving antibiotics. The patient's WBC count is trending down, but the patient may still be at risk for further infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates and is receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is less than 300, indicating that the patient is not receiving adequate oxygenation. The patient's RSBI is 79, indicating that the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. The patient's transaminases are trending down, but the patient's lipase levels are still elevated.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient is anticoagulated with coumadin and has received FFP and vitamin K. The patient's platelet count is stable, but the patient's fibrinogen level is elevated. The patient may be at risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 24.2%, which is lower than the patient's admission Hct of 29.3%. The patient may be at risk for further anemia.
6. Acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.37, which is within normal limits. However, the patient's ABG results indicate that the patient may be at risk for further acidosis.
7. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of CAD and is receiving ASA and lisinopril. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that the patient is at risk for further cardiac complications.
8. History of CVA: The patient has a history of CVA with no residual deficits. The patient is receiving ASA, which may be contraindicated in patients with a history of CVA.
9. FEN: The patient is NPO and is receiving IV fluids and electrolyte repletion. The patient may be at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
10. PPX: The patient is receiving SCDs and bowel regimen. The patient may be at risk for further bowel complications.

Based on these complications and concerns, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Continued monitoring of the patient's sepsis, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, anemia, acidosis, cardiovascular disease, and history of CVA.
2. Continued treatment of the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and IV fluids.
3. Continued respiratory support with oxygen therapy and possibly mechanical ventilation.
4. Continued treatment of the patient's pancreatitis with IV fluids and antibiotics.
5. Continued monitoring of the patient's coagulopathy and anemia, with possible transfusions as needed.
6. Continued monitoring of the patient's acidosis and cardiovascular disease, with possible treatment with medications as needed.
7. Continued treatment of the patient's history of CVA with ASA and lisinopril.
8. Continued monitoring of the patient's FEN and PPX, with possible treatment with medications as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
   .
   # PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV, a-line, CVL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, anemia, and a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 144/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 80 K/μL, and lactate of 1.7 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures have grown pan-sensitive E. coli, and the urine culture has been negative. 

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral infiltrates and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300 after an aspiration event. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to antibiotic administration, and the patient is receiving heparin prophylaxis. The patient's anemia is likely due to a combination of factors, including blood loss, hemolysis, and dilutional anemia. 

The patient's pancreatitis is stable, with transaminases trending down and lipase levels within normal limits. The patient is receiving IV fluids and is likely experiencing third spacing due to the pancreatitis. 

The patient's acidosis has resolved, but the patient's electrolytes are still abnormal. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a normal blood pressure and heart rate. 

Based on the patient's complex medical status, potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory decline due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of bilateral infiltrates.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and the patient may require further antibiotic therapy.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, and the patient may require further anticoagulation therapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue, and the patient may require further transfusions.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely to continue, and the patient may require further IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
6. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, but the patient may be at risk for further instability due to the patient's complex medical status.

Based on the patient's complex medical status, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor [**Age over 90 **], MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   - Cont ASA
   # CAD:
   - holding lisinopril
   - Cont ASA
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor [**Age over 90 **], MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.
   - Trend coags with AML.
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/83 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's mental status is improved since sedation was discontinued, and she is tolerating a peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.1, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 80. The patient's liver function tests are trending down, and her lipase levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing antibiotics for 14 days, monitoring her fever curve and white blood cell count, and following up on blood and urine cultures. The patient will also receive transfusions of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to her gallstone pancreatitis, and her white blood cell count is trending down.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy due to her Coumadin therapy and may require further transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to her pancreatitis and may require transfusions of packed red blood cells.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis due to her gallstone and may require further management with antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis has resolved, but she may still require close monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with Coumadin, but she may require further management with anti-coagulation therapy.
8. Hypovolemia: The patient may have hypovolemia due to her pancreatitis and may require fluid resuscitation.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including sepsis, coagulopathy, anemia, and pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her respiratory status is improving. However, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, coagulopathy, anemia, pancreatitis, acidosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypovolemia."

   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation reduced over past [**12-16**]
   days with improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema overnight after 250ml bolus given
   possible given that patient has been hypertensive (increased afterload)
   and chest radiograph consistent with fluid overload. Given 1 dose of
   furosemide 10mg IV x1 with good diuresis. Patient with blood in
   oropharynx today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will
   observe today and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc. Consider additional 1
   dose of furosemide today.
   - If unable to wean off of ventilator today, consider increasing
   sedation to increase comfort
 hypertensive and tachycardic overnight
   likely secondary to discomfort on ventilator.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation reduced over past [**12-16**]
   days with improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema overnight after 250ml bolus given
   possible given that patient has been hypertensive (increased afterload)
   and chest radiograph consistent with fluid overload. Given 1 dose of
   furosemide 10mg IV x1 with good diuresis. Patient with blood in
   oropharynx today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will
   observe today and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc. Consider additional 1
   dose of furosemide today.
   - If unable to wean off of ventilator today, consider increasing
   sedation to increase comfort
 hypertensive and tachycardic overnight
   likely secondary to discomfort on ventilator.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 18.2. Likely biliary sepsis given gallstone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor [**Month/Year (2) **], MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 27.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets slowly falling. Previous fibrinogen 339, D-dimer in 5000s,
   and recent smear with occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given
   course, coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and
   acute stress. Coags currently within normal range.
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been sedated, but the sedation has been reduced over the past 12-16 days with improvement in mental status. She has had a traumatic NGT placement, resulting in blood in her oropharynx. She has also had a 250ml bolus given, which has led to flash pulmonary edema and hypertension. She has been treated with furosemide and has had a good diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue if she is unable to be weaned off the ventilator. This could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and cardiac arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with antibiotics. This could lead to further complications such as organ failure, septic shock, and death.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with blood products and anticoagulants. This could lead to further complications such as bleeding, hematoma, and organ failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with blood transfusions. This could lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and organ failure.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with antibiotics and supportive care. This could lead to further complications such as organ failure, sepsis, and death.
6. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with diuretics and vasodilators. This could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely to continue if she is not adequately treated with antihypertensives. This could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and death.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, coagulopathy, anemia, pancreatitis, flash pulmonary edema, and hypertension. It is essential that the patient receives appropriate medical treatment and supportive care to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation. Pt was diuresed and negative 1.9L yesterday.  Pt did have
   a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  No new blood in
   oropharynx.
   - will attempt to extubate this AM
   - cont gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc.
   - Assess mental status, improving
   .
   # Sepsis: Off pressors, Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Afebrile.
   Leukocytosis trending down today to 14.2. Likely biliary sepsis given
   gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Pt sputum grew rare GNR.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   given diltiazem and 250cc and pressures dropped, was on levophed for
   several minutes and pt reverted back to sinus.  Started on low dose
   metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  Will hold on restarting anti-coagulation and
   discuss with patient and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] at high risk given co-morbities, but
   patient high risk for fall given age and mental status.
   - cont metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold anticoagulation, pt on ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 28.8.
   - Continue to monitor.
    .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Started TF yesterday.
   - can restart diet if extubated, given pt is able to swollow
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets slowly falling. Previous fibrinogen 339, D-dimer in 5000s,
   and recent smear with occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given
   course, coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and
   acute stress. Coags currently within normal range.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant past medical history, including atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has been off sedation with improvement in mental status. She is currently on prn sedation and is expected to be extubated this morning.
* Sepsis: The patient has been off pressors, and her fever has been trending down. She has leukocytosis, which is trending down, and is likely experiencing biliary sepsis given her gallstone pancreatitis and ERCP with blood cultures that grew pan-sensitive E. coli.
* A-fib: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was given diltiazem and 250cc to control her heart rate. She was on levophed for several minutes and reverted back to sinus rhythm. She is currently on low-dose metoprolol and will hold on restarting anticoagulation and discuss with her patient and PCP.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable around 28.8%.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and is being treated with TF.
* Coagulopathy: The patient is anticoagulated with Coumadin and has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission. Her platelets are slowly falling, and her coagulopathy is likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress, such as increased oxygen requirements or need for mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient may experience further septic shock, organ dysfunction, or death.
* A-fib: The patient may experience further atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, or arrhythmias.
* Anemia: The patient may experience further anemia, which can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
* Pancreatitis: The patient may experience further pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis, abscesses, or sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient may experience further bleeding or thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Diltiazem
* Fentanyl
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis)
* Metoprolol
* Augmentin
* ASA

The patient's laboratory results include:

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation. Pt was diuresed and negative 1.9L yesterday.  Pt did have
   a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  No new blood in
   oropharynx.
   - will attempt to extubate this AM
   - cont gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc.
   - Assess mental status, improving
   .
   # Sepsis: Off pressors, Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Afebrile.
   Leukocytosis trending down today to 14.2. Likely biliary sepsis given
   gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Pt sputum grew rare GNR.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   given diltiazem and 250cc and pressures dropped, was on levophed for
   several minutes and pt reverted back to sinus.  Started on low dose
   metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  Will hold on restarting anti-coagulation and
   discuss with patient and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] at high risk given co-morbities, but
   patient high risk for fall given age and mental status.
   - cont metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold anticoagulation, pt on ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 28.8.
   - Continue to monitor.
    .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Started TF yesterday.
   - can restart diet if extubated, given pt is able to swollow
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets slowly falling. Previous fibrinogen 339, D-dimer in 5000s,
   and recent smear with occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given
   course, coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and
   acute stress. Coags currently within normal range.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant past medical history, including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who developed gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient has undergone ERCP and has been treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40%. She has been diuresed and has a negative fluid balance of 1.9L. She is expected to be extubated today.
* Sepsis: The patient has been off pressors and is afebrile. Her leukocytosis is trending down, and she has a likely biliary sepsis given her gallstone pancreatitis and positive blood cultures. She is being treated with Augmentin for a total of 14 days.
* A-fib: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) yesterday after aggressive diuresis. She was given diltiazem and 250cc of fluid, and her pressures dropped. She was also started on low-dose metoprolol. Her anticoagulation has been held, and she is at high risk for fall given her age and mental status.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable around 28.8%.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and is being treated with TF. Her transaminases are trending down, and her lipase is within normal limits.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and acute stress. Her coags are currently within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.
* A-fib: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis can worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if she develops further complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive aggressive treatment for her respiratory failure, sepsis, and coagulopathy. Her anticoagulation should be held, and she should be monitored closely for any signs of deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent:  35 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 93-year-old female admitted with biliary sepsis and subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation. She has a history of Afib RVR and transient hypertension from diltiazem. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for biliary source, and her laboratory results show elevated WBC count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/85 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating possible cardiac injury. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated calcium level.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 98%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin general appearance, with symmetric chest expansion and crackles in the posterior fields. Her abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of biliary sepsis, and her laboratory results show elevated WBC count and LDH, indicating possible sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of Afib RVR and elevated troponin-T levels suggest possible cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of biliary sepsis and abdominal pain suggest possible gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of aspiration event and possible sepsis suggest possible neurological complications such as seizures, altered mental status, or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for signs of respiratory failure.
3. Continue antibiotics for biliary source and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely for signs of cardiac complications.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely for signs of gastrointestinal complications.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely for signs of neurological complications.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to optimize her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 critically ill
   Total time spent:  35 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 93-year-old female admitted with biliary sepsis and subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of urosepsis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/85 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%. Her respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, with a set Vt of 400 mL and PS of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR) yesterday, which was treated with diltiazem and is now in normal sinus rhythm. She is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, consistent with sepsis. Her liver function tests are trending down, and her kidney function is stable.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin patient with a soft, non-tender abdomen and clear breath sounds. She is able to follow simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli, but her movement and tone are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis and biliary sepsis can lead to further organ dysfunction and death if not adequately treated.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of aspiration event and biliary sepsis can increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and inability to move or assess tone can increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill 93-year-old female with a complex medical condition requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 93-year-old female admitted with biliary sepsis and subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation. She has been diagnosed with urosepsis, Afib RVR, and E. coli bacteremia. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia and concerns about secretions. She is receiving diuresis and is hemodynamically stable. The patient's cardiovascular status has improved after treatment with diltiazem, and her gastrointestinal status is trending down with no abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, and she may require further treatment for hypoxemia and secretions.
2. Biliary Sepsis: The patient's biliary sepsis may lead to further complications, such as septic shock, organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
3. E. coli Bacteremia: The patient's E. coli bacteremia may lead to septicemia, septic shock, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's Afib RVR may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. GI Complications: The patient's GI status may deteriorate, leading to further complications, such as GI bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, such as VAP, DVT, and UTI, due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
7. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and any imbalance may lead to further complications, such as hypotension, shock, and organ failure.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status may deteriorate due to her compromised gut function and prolonged hospitalization, leading to further complications, such as malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation.  Extubatation initially complicated by pulmonary edema and
   then afib with RVR.  RSBI this AM 40.
   - SBT and extabate this AM if tolerated.
   - Goal TBB even today
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient febrile yesterday to 102 with blood and sputum
   cultures sent.  Leukocytosis trending down today to 12.6. Likely
   biliary sepsis given gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood
   cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days ([**5-28**])
 antibiotic start
   date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR two days ago in setting of aggressive
   diuresis that broke with diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension
   requiring brief period of levophed.  She was then started on metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given supratherapeutic
   INR on presnetation and will be deferred to outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 27.4.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   - Continue TF
   - can restart diet if extubated, given pt is able to swollow
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin
   on admission. She has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission
   for INR >5. Platelets currently stable at 73 up from 65 yesterday.
   - Trend coags, CBC
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding lisinopril
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - Cont ASA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. She was admitted to the ICU after being intubated for respiratory failure and developed sepsis with a fever of 102°F. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors, and has shown improvement in her mental status and respiratory status. However, she remains at risk for complications such as pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and bleeding due to her coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory failure and sepsis increase her risk of developing pulmonary edema, which can lead to worsening respiratory status and cardiac complications.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) increases her risk of developing cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and stroke.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis increases her risk of developing organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases her risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding from invasive procedures.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases her risk of bleeding, including petechiae, ecchymoses, and bleeding from invasive procedures.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis increases her risk of developing pancreatic complications, including pancreatic necrosis, abscess, and fistula.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia increases her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, including cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and decreased tolerance to stress.
8. Infection: The patient's sepsis increases her risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed to prevent pulmonary edema.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed to prevent stroke and cardiac complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent organ dysfunction.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia and adjust her blood product therapy as needed to prevent bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's pancreatitis and adjust her therapy as needed to prevent pancreatic complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusion therapy as needed to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent secondary infections.
8. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or a gastroenterologist, to optimize the patient's care and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51 kg, 58-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.0°F (38.9°C) at 12:00 PM, with a current temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C)
* Heart rate: 79 bpm (72-96 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 148/81 mmHg (108-155/73-89 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (13-24 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient has a fever, which is being monitored, and has had blood cultures sent. A sputum culture was also sent, but the results are not yet available. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows no new consolidations.

The patient is receiving several medications, including antibiotics (Ampicillin/Sulbactam), lasix (furosemide), heparin (prophylaxis), and fentanyl. The patient is also receiving oxygen therapy via an endotracheal tube and is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 18.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 63 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20 mg/dL
* Sodium: 142 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
* Chloride: 110 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.4 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Blood culture (BCx): Not growing (NGTD)
* Sputum culture: Not growing (NGTD)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* ICU care
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is being monitored and managed as needed
* Lines: The patient has an arterial line and a multi-lumen line
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)

Based on the patient's lab results and medical history, it is recommended that the patient's antibiotics be continued and that the patient's glucose level be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored to prevent electrolyte imbalances."

   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation.  Extubatation initially complicated by pulmonary edema and
   then afib with RVR.  RSBI this AM 40.
   - SBT and extabate this AM if tolerated.
   - Goal TBB even today
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient febrile yesterday to 102 with blood and sputum
   cultures sent.  Leukocytosis trending down today to 12.6. Likely
   biliary sepsis given gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood
   cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR two days ago in setting of aggressive
   diuresis that broke with diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension
   requiring brief period of levophed.  She was then started on metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given supratherapeutic
   INR on presnetation and will be deferred to outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 27.4.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   - Continue TF
   - can restart diet if extubated, given pt is able to swollow
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin
   on admission. She has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission
   for INR >5. Platelets currently stable at 73 up from 65 yesterday.
   - Trend coags, CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation.  Extubatation initially complicated by pulmonary edema and
   then afib with RVR.  RSBI this AM 40.
   - SBT and extabate this AM if tolerated.
   - Goal TBB even today
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient febrile yesterday to 102 with blood and sputum
   cultures sent.  Leukocytosis trending down today to 12.6. Likely
   biliary sepsis given gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood
   cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR two days ago in setting of aggressive
   diuresis that broke with diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension
   requiring brief period of levophed.  She was then started on metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given supratherapeutic
   INR on presnetation and will be deferred to outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Respiratory Status:** The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, SpO2 of 97%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and there is a risk of reintubation due to pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

**Sepsis:** The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 102°F, and blood and sputum cultures have been sent. The patient has likely biliary sepsis given the gallstone pancreatitis and blood cultures that have been speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli. The patient is being treated with Augmentin for a total of 14 days.

**Cardiovascular Status:** The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with RVR, which has been complicated by pulmonary edema and transient hypotension. The patient is currently on metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily and is being monitored for AFib with RVR.

**Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia:** The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K for an international normalized ratio (INR) >5. The patient's platelet count is currently stable at 73, up from 65 yesterday.

**Anemia:** The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 9.2 g/dL.

**Pancreatitis:** The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of reintubation due to pulmonary edema and AFib with RVR.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFib with RVR and may develop other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has a coagulopathy and may be at risk of bleeding complications.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and may develop complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscesses.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and transfusions may be necessary.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and coagulation status, as well as to continue treatment for sepsis and pancreatitis. The patient's anemia and coagulopathy should also be closely monitored, and transfusions or other interventions may be necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, pancreatitis, and a history of gallstone pancreatitis. She was intubated due to aspiration during central venous line insertion and has been weaned off sedation. She has been treated with antibiotics for biliary sepsis and has been monitored for fever, WBC, and blood and urine cultures. Her atrial fibrillation has been managed with metoprolol and anticoagulation has been deferred due to a supratherapeutic INR. She has been receiving furosemide for fluid management and has been monitored for electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further respiratory support or mechanical ventilation if she does not tolerate spontaneous breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely biliary in origin, and she may require continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring for fever and WBC.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may require further management with antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion, and anticoagulation should be restarted once the INR is within a therapeutic range.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further evaluation and management, and she may require blood transfusions if her hemoglobin level becomes critically low.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may require continued monitoring and management, and she may require further treatment with antibiotics or other medications if her condition does not improve.
6. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may require further management with blood products and platelet transfusions if necessary.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may require further management with electrolyte replacement therapy and monitoring.
8. CVA: The patient's history of CVA may require further evaluation and management, and she may require further treatment with anticoagulation or other medications if her condition does not improve.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated
   yesterday. Yesterday afternoon had increasing secretions and difficulty
   clearing airway with temporary increase in oxygen requirement that
   resolved with suctioning.  Has been stable from respiratory standpoint
   overnight.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam yesterday
   as patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam or amox/clav ([**6-27**])
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv yesterday. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given
   supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a significant medical history, including atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who has developed gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and respiratory failure. She was recently extubated and has been stable overnight. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen of 180 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 73. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 96 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 81 IU/L. 

The patient's medical plan includes continuing antibiotics, monitoring for fever and white blood cell count, and monitoring urine output, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, mentation, and intravenous fluids as necessary. She is also to be weaned from supplemental oxygen as tolerated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her recent extubation and history of gallstone pancreatitis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has resolved, but she is at risk for recurrence if her antibiotics are not effective or if she develops a new infection.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is stable, but she is at risk for developing a thrombus or experiencing a cardiac event.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is stable, but she is at risk for developing anemia due to her ongoing bleeding or transfusion requirements.
5. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but she is at risk for developing a coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia due to her ongoing bleeding or transfusion requirements.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is stable, but she is at risk for developing a pancreatic abscess or pancreatic necrosis.
7. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she is at risk for developing a cardiac arrest due to her atrial fibrillation, anemia, or coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient is at risk for developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a significant past medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable from a respiratory standpoint overnight. However, she had increasing secretions and difficulty clearing her airway yesterday afternoon, requiring suctioning and temporary increase in oxygen requirement.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 59 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 134/66 mmHg
* SpO2: 96%
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 1 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 14.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 73 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.0 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 18 mmol/L
* Glucose: 82 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Gallstone pancreatitis
* Biliary sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation
* Anemia
* Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia
* History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with no residual deficits
* History of coronary artery disease (CAD) with holding of lisinopril and continuing ASA

The patient's current medications include:

* Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid (converted to IV yesterday)
* Amox/clav (converted to amp/sulbactam yesterday)
* Fentanyl
* Lasix (furosemide)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Aspiration pneumonia due to the risk of aspiration with eating and drinking
* Sepsis due to the ongoing biliary sepsis
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying respiratory disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation
* Bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to the patient's history of CVA and CAD

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning supplemental oxygen as tolerated
* Continuing amp/sulbactam or amox/clav
* Monitoring fever curve and WBC
* Monitoring UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation, and bolus IVF as necessary
* Continuing metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
* Holding anticoagulation and continuing ASA
* Trending hct and transfusing for hct < 25
* Continuing ASA and holding lisinopril
* Replete as necessary
* Starting clears and ADAT today and placing a speech and swallow consult

The patient's disposition is pending hemodynamic stability, and she will be transferred to the hemodynamics unit if stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated
   yesterday. Yesterday afternoon had increasing secretions and difficulty
   clearing airway with temporary increase in oxygen requirement that
   resolved with suctioning.  Has been stable from respiratory standpoint
   overnight.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam yesterday
   as patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam or amox/clav ([**6-27**]) depending on ability to
   tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv yesterday. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given
   supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV yesterday as patient NPO, but
   will switch back if tolerating PO today.
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's current status is:

* Respiratory: The patient has been stable overnight, but was made NPO due to concern of aspiration risk. The plan is to wean supplemental oxygen as tolerated.
* Sepsis: The patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with leukocytosis now resolved. The antibiotics have been converted to amp/sulbactam, and the plan is to continue monitoring for fever, WBC, UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation, and bolus IVF as necessary.
* A-fib: The patient developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis, which was broken with diltiazem. The patient has been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid, converted to IV yesterday. Anticoagulation has been held due to supratherapeutic INR on presentation.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 27.2. The plan is to trend Hct and transfuse for Hct <25.
* LUE swelling: The patient has concerning swelling in the left hand, which may be due to DVT. A LUE US is planned to rule out DVT.
* HTN: The patient's BP has been normal to elevated overnight. The plan is to restart lisinopril 5 mg daily today.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which was treated with ERCP. The plan is to continue clears and ADAT.
* Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5. The platelet count is currently stable at 73 up from 65 yesterday. The plan is to trend coags and CBC.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and ASA has been continued.
* Hx of CVA: The patient has a history of CVA without residual deficits, and ASA has been continued.
* FEN: The patient has been NPO yesterday after inability to clear secretions and weak cough. The plan is to start clears and ADAT today, and a speech and swallow consult has been placed.
* PPX: The patient has been given heparin SQ and PPI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to continued respiratory distress, or aspiration of secretions.
* Sepsis: The patient may experience sepsis due to continued bacteremia or secondary infections.
* A-fib: The patient may experience A-fib due to continued arrhythmia or electrolyte imbalance.
* Anemia: The patient may experience anemia due to continued bleeding or hemolysis.
* LUE swelling: The patient may experience LUE swelling due to continued DVT or cellulitis.
* HTN: The patient may experience HTN due to continued hypertension or electrolyte imbalance.
* Pancreatitis: The patient may experience pancreatitis due to continued inflammation or obstruction.
* Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient may experience coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia due to continued bleeding or hemolysis.
* CAD: The patient may experience CAD due to continued atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease.
* Hx of CVA: The patient may experience a CVA due to continued atherosclerosis or embolism.
* FEN: The patient may experience FEN due to continued inflammation or infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated
   yesterday. Yesterday afternoon had increasing secretions and difficulty
   clearing airway with temporary increase in oxygen requirement that
   resolved with suctioning.  Has been stable from respiratory standpoint
   overnight.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam yesterday
   as patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam or amox/clav ([**6-27**]) depending on ability to
   tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv yesterday. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given
   supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV yesterday as patient NPO, but
   will switch back if tolerating PO today.
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable overnight. However, she has been made NPO due to concerns of aspiration risk and has been converted to IV medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. She has decreased breath sounds at the right base and is able to converse, but has difficulty clearing secretions.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable overnight, but has had increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway.
* Sepsis: The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable overnight, but has leukocytosis that has resolved.
* A-fib: The patient developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis and was started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid, which was converted to IV yesterday.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 27.2%.
* LUE swelling: The patient has concern for DVT, which is unlikely to be cellulitis given the absence of erythema.
* HTN: The patient's BP has been normal to elevated overnight.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis that was successfully treated with ERCP.
* Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient is anticoagulated with coumadin and has received FFP and vitamin K for an INR >5.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is taking ASA.
* Hx of CVA: The patient has a history of CVA with no residual deficits and is taking ASA.
* FEN: The patient has been NPO due to concerns of aspiration risk and will start clears and ADAT today.
* PPX: The patient is taking heparin SQ and PPI.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning supplemental O2 as tolerated
* Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix
* Continuing amp/sulbactam or amox/clav depending on ability to tolerate PO
* Monitoring fever curve and WBC
* Monitoring UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation, and bolus IVF as necessary
* Continuing metoprolol
* Holding anticoagulation and continuing ASA
* Trending Hct and transfusing for Hct <25
* Performing LUE US to r/o DVT
* Restarting lisinopril 5 mg daily
* Clearing ADAT
* Continuing ASA
* Continuing FEN
* Continuing PPX

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to be called out if hemodynamically stable this morning."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - will hold on lasix for now given hypernatermia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits on history.  Fmaily concerned
   yesterday that pt was not using left hand.  Pt was examined yesterday
   and today and pt has no obvious deficits.  Pt is using her left hand
   and there was no neglect on left side.
   - cont to monitor and image if symtpoms appear
   - Cont ASA
   .
   #Hypernatermia: Pt w/ sodium 148.  Free water deficit is 1.5L.  Will
   get S&S  and if patient passes will replete via po intake.  If patient
   does not pass will give through IVF.
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 26.6.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25. Has received 1u PRBC during
   admission.
   .
   # LUE Swelling: No evidence of DVT on U/S. Unlikely to be cellulitlis
   as hand without erythema.
   -cont to monitor
   .
   # HTN: BP overnight normal to elevated.
   - pt on BB
   - will hold po lisinopril 5 mg daily until S&S.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successful
   ERCP.
   - Clears - ADAT.
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin
   on admission. She has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission
   for INR >5. Platelets currently stable at 106.
   - Trend coags, CBC
   .
   # CAD:
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO yesterday after inability to clear secretions and weak
   cough. Speech and swallow consult placed. Replete as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Access: Arterial line, RIJ
   - will pull a-line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - will hold on lasix for now given hypernatermia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits on history.  Fmaily concerned
   yesterday that pt was not using left hand.  Pt was examined yesterday
   and today and pt has no obvious deficits.  Pt is using her left hand
   and there was no neglect on left side.
   - cont to monitor and image if symtpoms appear
   - Cont ASA
   .
   #Hypernatermia: Pt w/ sodium 148.  Free water deficit is 1.5L.  Will
   get S&S  and if patient passes will replete via po intake.  If patient
   does not pass will give through IVF.
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 90+ year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and sepsis. She has been in the ICU for an extended period, with multiple complications. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, with aspiration and difficulty clearing her airway. She has been made NPO and converted to IV meds. Her sepsis is currently stable, with a resolving leukocytosis.

The patient has also shown signs of hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 148 and a free water deficit of 1.5L. Her anemia is stable, with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL. She has a history of CVA, but has shown no residual deficits.

The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are being monitored, with platelet levels currently stable at 106. She has a history of CAD and is taking ASA. Her pancreatitis is stable, with a successful ERCP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of aspiration and difficulty clearing her airway may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrence or progression.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level of 148 and free water deficit of 1.5L may lead to further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet levels may continue to decline, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring further transfusions.
6. CVA: Although the patient has shown no residual deficits, there is a risk of further neurological decline.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may continue to progress, leading to further complications.

Based on this assessment, I recommend close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits on history.  Fmaily concerned
   yesterday that pt was not using left hand.  Pt was examined yesterday
   and today and pt has no obvious deficits.  Pt is using her left hand
   and there was no neglect on left side.
   - cont to monitor and image if symtpoms appear
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 26.6.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25. Has received 1u PRBC during
   admission.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

* The patient is a 90+ year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
* She was extubated successfully and is currently on IV medications due to concerns of aspiration risk.
* The patient has a history of CVA, but there are no residual deficits on examination.
* She has developed RVR in the setting of aggressive diuresis, which was broken with diltiazem, complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period of levophed.
* The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a heart rate of 60-76 bpm, blood pressure of 168/87-171/92 mmHg, and SpO2 of 100%.
* She has a fluid balance of -725ml, with a urine output of 50ml/hour.
* The patient's neurological examination is significant for minimal left hand and extensor weakness, as well as decreased cerebellar function (finger to nose), but this improved on follow-up examination.
* Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, which has resolved, and anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with lisinopril, and is also taking aspirin for atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV antibiotics.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications.
* Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk of developing various medical complications due to her underlying condition and the use of IV medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 26.6.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25. Has received 1u PRBC during
   admission.
   .
   # LUE Swelling: No evidence of DVT on U/S. Unlikely to be cellulitlis
   as hand without erythema.
   -cont to monitor
   .
   # HTN: BP overnight normal to elevated.
   - Restart lisinopril 5 mg daily today.

   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successful
   ERCP.
   - Clears - ADAT.
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin
   on admission. She has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission
   for INR >5. Platelets currently stable at 106.
