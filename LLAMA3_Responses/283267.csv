   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and

   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which can worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of recurrent ischemic events and cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or bone marrow dysfunction. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
6. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or other underlying conditions.
7. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, which can exacerbate the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PTT), which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
10. Infection: The patient has a central line and urinary catheter, which increases the risk of catheter-related infections.
11. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and is at risk for cardiovascular complications, including heart block, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive management of hypotension and oliguric renal failure, and further investigation into the etiology of leukocytosis and fever of unknown origin. The patient also requires close monitoring of electrolyte imbalances and coagulopathy, as well as prophylactic measures to prevent catheter-related infections and cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.

   be expedited for soon after d/c.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and recent NSTEMI. She was admitted to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. She has a dual-chamber pacemaker and is currently in atrial fibrillation with heart block.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/47 mmHg. She has a central venous catheter and a PICC line in place. Her laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications. The main concerns are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk of further hypotension, particularly if she becomes volume-depleted or has a sudden drop in cardiac output.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss, and she is at risk of further bleeding if she is not properly managed.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and she is at risk of further kidney damage if she is not properly managed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to infection, and she is at risk of developing sepsis if she is not properly managed.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is a significant risk factor for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis if her infection is not properly managed.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation make her at risk of cardiac arrest if her cardiac function is not properly managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury is a significant risk factor for renal failure if she is not properly managed.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet dysfunction make her at risk of bleeding if she is not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and anemia make her at risk of developing an infection if she is not properly managed.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Fluid management: The patient's fluid status will be closely monitored to prevent volume depletion and hypotension.
2. Blood transfusion: The patient will receive blood transfusions as needed to manage her anemia and blood loss.
3. Antibiotics: The patient will receive antibiotics to manage her infection and prevent further complications.
4. Cardiac management: The patient's cardiac function will be closely monitored to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Renal management: The patient's kidney function will be closely monitored to prevent further kidney damage.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's potential medical complications are numerous, and she requires careful management to prevent sepsis, cardiac arrest, renal failure, bleeding, and infection."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. That said, etiology is most likely hypovolemic given
   physical exam, urine sodium of 11, decreased po intake, and
   orthostasis. SVO2 of 60 argues against sepsis but does not reliably
   distinguish btw hypovolemia and cardiogenic. Flat neck veins argue
   against cardiogenic.  Pt is s/p 2.5L fluid resusication and 1U pRBC
   with adeqaute effect on BP, but dissapointing UOP.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 28: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime, also will give po vanco
   for empiric c.diff covg.
   --Blood cultures, urine culture (UA mildly+), low suspicion for
   parenchymal lung process given imaging and resp status, although
   effusion is a possible source
   --repeat CDIFF
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --would prefer to avoid pressor given SVO2, but would choose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down compared to prior, slow
   decline not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs.
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung as above
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation
   today. Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is
   part of rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley.
   Would benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowere as she is fairly inactive at
   baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes tomorrow
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, recent NSTEMI, and is currently on empiric antibiotics for a suspected infection. The patient's leukocytosis and anion gap may indicate a septic process. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture are pending, and the physician is considering diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out an effusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and the current respiratory status is not improving despite fluid resuscitation and diuresis. The patient's SpO2 is 98%, but the ABG results indicate a mixed respiratory acidosis.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, recent NSTEMI, and is currently on empiric antibiotics for a suspected infection. The patient's cardiac rhythm is AFIB, and the physician is concerned about the potential for cardiac complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of oliguric renal failure, and the current urine output is still <30. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and the physician is considering a renal consult if the urine output does not improve.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the current guaiac test is positive. The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and a recent NSTEMI. The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
7. Inflammatory Response: The patient has a history of inflammatory response, including leukocytosis and anion gap. The patient's inflammatory response may be exacerbated by the current infection and the use of empiric antibiotics.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and recent NSTEMI. The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for the suspected infection.
2. Consider diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out an effusion.
3. Continue fluid resuscitation and diuresis to improve the patient's respiratory status.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adjusting the patient's medications as necessary.
5. Consider a renal consult if the patient's urine output does not improve.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider adjusting the patient's medications as necessary.
7. Consider a bleeding consult if the patient experiences any bleeding complications.
8. Monitor the patient's inflammatory response and consider adjusting the patient's medications as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider adjusting the patient's medications as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a blood culture from the left wrist, PICC line inserted, and ongoing fluid resuscitation. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, anemia, and unknown origin fever. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 83/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.40, pCO2 of 37 mmHg, and pO2 of 95 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for right lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture from the left wrist and ongoing fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's ongoing fluid resuscitation and hypotension (blood pressure of 83/47 mmHg) indicate the possibility of hypovolemic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and ABG results suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death if not promptly treated.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia, secondary to blood loss, can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, potentially exacerbating other medical complications.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
6. Infection: The patient's unknown origin fever and ongoing respiratory support increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death if not promptly treated.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's ongoing fluid resuscitation and fluid balance data suggest the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, and death if not promptly treated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and asthma, who was initially admitted to the MICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure, ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia, and afib with RVR. She was intubated and required a temporary pacer wire. After being discharged to the floor, she was readmitted to the ICU with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which is likely due to hypovolemia, but cannot be ruled out as septic physiology given the elevated WBC count. The patient is receiving IV fluids and norepinephrine to maintain a MAP > 55.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which must consider infectious etiology/septic shock given the pressor requirement. Recent instrumentation with pacer placement and elevated LFTs are contributing factors.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, with a urine sodium of 11, suggesting a pre-renal etiology. Contrast nephropathy is also a possibility.
4. CAD: The patient has 3VD of both native vessels and grafts, and is receiving aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor. ACE and metoprolol have been held.
5. CHF: The patient has mild pulmonary edema and elevated JVP, and is receiving judicious IV fluids and pressors or hypotension.
6. Arrhythmia: The patient has afib with RVR and is receiving a dual-chamber pacer. The EP team has recommended restarting coumadin in the long run, but has deferred it for now due to persistently low Hct and guaiac+.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be related to hypotension. Unlikely to be an indication of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's elevated WBC count, recent instrumentation, and elevated LFTs, septic shock is a possibility.
2. Contrast nephropathy: The patient's oliguric renal failure and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of contrast nephropathy.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure increases the risk of pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and CHF increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and elevated LFTs increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and a recent CABG. She was initially admitted to the MICU for pneumonia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and bradycardia requiring temporary pacing.

The patient's current condition is critical, with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. She has been treated with IV fluids, norepinephrine, and empiric antibiotics, and has undergone a range of diagnostic tests, including blood cultures, troponin levels, and electrocardiograms.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia, but septic physiology cannot be ruled out. She has been treated with IV fluids and norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 55 mmHg.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to an infectious etiology or septic shock. She has been treated with empiric antibiotics and is undergoing further evaluation, including abdominal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy if necessary.
3. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely due to a pre-renal etiology, although contrast nephropathy is also a possibility. She has been treated with judicious IV fluids and is undergoing further evaluation, including renal ultrasound and creatinine levels.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG. She is currently being treated with aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient has mild pulmonary edema and elevated jugular venous pressure, consistent with congestive heart failure. She has been treated with diuretics and is undergoing further evaluation, including echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization.
6. Arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rate-responsive pacemaker. She has undergone electrophysiology study and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy.
7. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to hypotension, infection, or congestive hepatopathy. She is being monitored and treated accordingly.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to bleeding, hemolysis, or chronic disease. She is being treated with blood transfusions and is undergoing further evaluation, including endoscopy and colonoscopy.

Based on this information, the patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and oliguric renal failure may be due to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury if not managed appropriately.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's congestive heart failure and arrhythmia may increase her risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may progress to liver failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and elevated liver enzymes may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's congestive heart failure may lead to pulmonary edema, which may worsen her respiratory status.
7. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may be due to an underlying infection, which may not have been fully evaluated.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address her complex medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's imaging results show normal-sized kidneys with no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
* Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance.
* Coronary artery disease can lead to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
* Fever, unknown origin, can lead to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Renal consultation to rule out acute tubular necrosis and to consider additional interventions to improve renal function.
* Blood transfusions to treat anemia.
* Cardiac monitoring to monitor for signs of coronary artery disease.
* Respiratory support to manage respiratory failure.
* Antibiotics to treat potential infections.
* Fluid management to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
* Nutritional support to manage malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
* Glycemic control to manage hyperglycemia.
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension, decreased urine output, and increased leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 96 bpm, BP 99/39 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%
* Laboratory results: WBC 24.3 x 10^9/L, Hct 26.9%, Plt 295 x 10^9/L, Cr 2.1 mg/dL, Trop-T 2.02 ng/mL, Glucose 155 mg/dL
* Imaging: Renal US showed normal-sized kidneys with no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis
* Assessment and plan:
	+ Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
	+ Hypotension (not shock)
	+ Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
	+ Coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease)
	+ Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia)
	+ Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's current renal function is compromised, and further deterioration can lead to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI puts her at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure, requiring long-term oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and anemia puts her at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Sepsis: The patient's infection can progress to sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions, including optimization of her cardiac function, management of her respiratory status, and treatment of her infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic etiologies must be considered in the
   pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked leukocytosis.  Currently
   appears fluid overloaded, though may be intravascularly depleted.
   Patient is tachycardic with low EF, with likely poor forward flow.
   --check albumin
   --low dose digoxin in an attempt to rate control Afib
   --diurese with lasix gtt with goal -500cc as BP tolerates.
   --consider cardioversion with EP if continues to be hypotensive
   --d/c Vanc and Cefepime given that this is more likely cardiogenic in
   etiology. Would restart abx if patient spikes fevers.
   --continue neo to keep MAPs>60
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear. C diff negative.
   Less likely would be acute rxn to pacer implantation --too early to
   invoke infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --d/c Vanc and Cefepime for now given no localizing signs of infection.
   Restart if develops fevers or worsening hypotension.
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Add
   on LFTs for today.
   --f/u culture data
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently fluid overloaded. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but
   will resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   - diuresis with lasix gtt
goal -500cc today

   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Changed to VVI set at 60.

   --d/w EP re: potential cardioversion
   --speak with EP prior to d/c so they can reset pacer

   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement increased. This morning renal thinks this
   may be [**1-29**] poor forward flow given low EF.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not properly managed. The patient's urine output is still low, and the renal consultant suspects that the patient may have prerenal azotemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and the patient is at risk of developing shock if not properly managed. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and the patient may require further interventions to improve cardiac output.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia, which may be secondary to blood loss. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and the patient may require transfusions to improve oxygen delivery.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying cardiopulmonary disease. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and the patient may require further interventions to improve respiratory function.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation. The patient's differential count shows a predominance of neutrophils, which may indicate an infectious process.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may be secondary to the patient's underlying disease or treatment. The patient's potassium level is low, and the patient may require supplementation to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated, which may be a sign of bleeding diathesis. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is normal, but the patient may still be at risk of bleeding.
8. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation. The patient's temperature is elevated, and the patient may require further evaluation and treatment to determine the cause of the fever.

To manage these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team. The patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Fluid management: The patient requires careful fluid management to prevent fluid overload and improve cardiac output.
2. Vasopressor support: The patient may require vasopressor support to improve blood pressure and cardiac output.
3. Diuresis: The patient requires diuresis to improve urine output and prevent fluid overload.
4. Blood transfusions: The patient may require blood transfusions to improve anemia and oxygen delivery.
5. Antibiotic therapy: The patient may require antibiotic therapy to treat potential infections.
6. Electrolyte supplementation: The patient may require electrolyte supplementation to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Coagulopathy management: The patient may require coagulopathy management to prevent bleeding.
8. Fever management: The patient may require fever management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and asthma, admitted to the ICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure, ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, and bradycardia. She was initially intubated and required a temporary pacemaker wire due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was later transferred to the floor for a cardiac catheterization and pacemaker placement, but was readmitted to the ICU due to acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, hypotension, decreased urine output, and increased leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension, requiring pressor support
* Decreased urine output, with a goal of increasing diuresis
* Increased leukocytosis, with a suspicion of cardiorenal syndrome
* Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, requiring digoxin therapy
* Left upper extremity swelling, with a plan for Doppler ultrasound
* Transaminitis, with a plan for repeat testing
* Guaiac-positive stools, with a need for colonoscopy prior to discharge

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiorenal syndrome, with a risk of worsening renal function and cardiac compromise
* Contrast nephropathy, due to the recent cardiac catheterization
* Sepsis, despite the lack of symptoms and signs of infection
* Low oncotic pressure, due to the patient's cardiorenal syndrome and hypotension
* Respiratory failure, due to the patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* GI bleeding, due to the patient's guaiac-positive stools and history of anticoagulation therapy
* Thrombosis, due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and low EF

Plan:

* Continue pressor support to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 55 mmHg
* Increase diuresis with Lasix and monitor for response
* Maintain low-dose neostigmine to aid diuresis
* Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, and resume antibiotics if necessary
* Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis
* Address colonoscopy prior to discharge
* Monitor for respiratory failure and adjust therapy accordingly
* Monitor for GI bleeding and adjust therapy accordingly
* Continue to monitor for cardiorenal syndrome and adjust therapy accordingly"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, CABG, HTN, and asthma, admitted to the MICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia, and afib with RVR. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

The patient's condition is critical, and the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's hypotension, decreased urine output, and increased leukocytosis suggest a cardiorenal syndrome, which can lead to acute kidney injury and worsening of cardiac function.
2. Contrast nephropathy: The patient's recent catheterization and pacer placement may have caused contrast nephropathy, which can further compromise renal function.
3. Heart block and afib: The patient's afib and heart block may require further management, including adjustment of medications and possible pacemaker intervention.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require continued mechanical ventilation and possible adjustment of oxygen therapy.
5. Infection: Although the patient's antibiotics were stopped due to low suspicion of infection, the patient's leukocytosis and anion gap may suggest an underlying infection.
6. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and increased leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's increased JVD and bibasilar crackles may suggest cardiac tamponade, which can compromise cardiac function and lead to cardiac arrest.
8. Pulmonary edema: The patient's increased JVD and bibasilar crackles may also suggest pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis: 24.3 K/uL
* Anion gap: 20 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 49 mg/dL
* Electrolyte imbalance: Na 138 mEq/L, K 4.0 mEq/L
* Troponin-T: 2.02 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 517 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: L > R effusion, cardiomegaly
* Renal ultrasound: unremarkable
* Echocardiogram: EF 25%, mild to moderate MR, inferobasal LV aneurysm, PASP est 48, nl RV size and function

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue Lasix gtt and monitor pressor requirement for diuresis
* Adjust cardiac regimen as outlined above
* Continue monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis
* Consider colonoscopy prior to discharge due to long-term anticoagulation therapy."

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially volume depleted as suported by physical exam
   (flat neck veins , clear lungs, skin tenting, dry tongue) and urine
   sodium of 11.  Volume repletion overshot and resulted in some degree of
   failure. At peak was 5.5 L positive, with lasix drip, ended 3.5 L
   positive length of stay. Crackles only at bases, JVP now at clavicle at
   90 degrees, likely approaching euvolemia. Off pressors
   --started on dig yesterday for failure and rate control
   --d/c lasix drip as approaching euvolemia
   --consider cardioversion as seems to have done better hemodynamically
   when in sinus
   --d/c
ed Vanc and Cefepime given that this is more likely cardiogenic
   in etiology. Would restart abx if patient spikes fevers.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear. C diff negative.
   Less likely would be acute rxn to pacer implantation --too early to
   invoke infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --d/c
ed Vanc and Cefepime for now given no localizing signs of
   infection. Restart if develops fevers or worsening hypotension.
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. LFTS
   now trending down, was likely acute injury [**1-29**] hypotension.
   --f/u culture data
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently fluid overloaded. Holding ACEI given  ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   ***Need to discuss with cardiology re: inferior LV aneurysm seen on
   second echo. Per read in system, unclear if this is new s/p NSTEMI, if
   that is the case, anticoagulation would be indiacted in the acute
   setting to avoid LV thrombus. If this is an old finding, no acute
   anti-coag needed, pt would require it only for AFIB with high CHADS.
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Changed to VVI set at 60.
   --speak with EP prior to d/c so they can reset pacer
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Initial Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  This rose to 84 with volume repletion (prior to receiving
   lasix) further suggesting prereanl etiology of initial oliguria. Also
   some likely contribution from contrast as [**Last Name (un) **] seems [**Last Name (un) 9131**] have occurred
   48-72 hrs post cath
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She was transferred to the ICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. The patient's condition has been managed with volume repletion, digoxin for heart failure and rate control, and discontinuation of antibiotics. The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure and oliguric renal failure. The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss. The patient's cardiac status is monitored closely, and the possibility of elective cardioversion is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and oliguric renal failure put her at risk for further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased mortality.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to stress.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure, exacerbated by her low ejection fraction, may lead to further decompensation and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and heart block put her at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Infection: The patient's recent NSTEMI and prolonged hospitalization put her at risk for nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent bleeding may increase her risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise and increased risk of mortality.
8. Sepsis: The patient's infection and immunosuppression put her at risk for sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status, including her atrial fibrillation and heart block, may lead to further cardiovascular instability and increased risk of cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including her heart rate, blood pressure, and rhythm.
2. Continue to manage the patient's renal function with fluid repletion and electrolyte management.
3. Consider elective cardioversion to restore atrial kick and improve forward flow.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
7. Consider sepsis protocols if the patient develops signs of sepsis.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and consider cardiovascular support measures if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall, 69.4 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, anemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has been receiving furosemide (Lasix) infusion at 5 mg/hour, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 91/42 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and their laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and their laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels. These factors increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has coronary artery disease, and their laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. This increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which increases the risk of infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, indicating possible infection.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of bleeding, and their laboratory results show anemia, which increases the risk of hemorrhage.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which increases the risk of further kidney damage and potential long-term complications.
7. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin, elevated white blood cell count, and anemia increase the risk of sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels, which increase the risk of pneumonia.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* The patient is a 76-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and a recent NSTEMI.
* She has been transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
* The patient has a low EF (25-30%), and her rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a dual-chamber pacemaker.
* She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, anemia, and coronary artery disease.

**Potential Complications:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock:** Given the patient's low EF and history of NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock is a concern. The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output may be indicative of poor forward flow, which can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's oliguric renal failure and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI. This can worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
3. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. This can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
4. **Thromboembolic Events:** The patient's history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.
5. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid overload and decreased urine output may lead to further complications, including respiratory failure and worsening cardiac function.
6. **Electrical Instability:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of NSTEMI increase her risk of electrical instability, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding or perforation.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Maintain a high index of suspicion for cardiogenic shock and AKI.
3. Consider cardioversion with EP if the patient's hypotension persists.
4. Restart antibiotics if the patient develops fevers or worsening hypotension.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize the patient's cardiac care.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy as needed.

**Recommendations:**

1. Consider adding a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the patient's cardiac output and filling pressures.
2. Consider adding a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and detect any potential complications.
3. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's renal care.
4. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed to maintain tight glycemic control."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o, female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma visiting
   from [**Location (un) 9832**], originally admitted to MICU for PNA, hypercarbic
   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   Hypotension- I suspect more of a cardiorenal picture at this point,
   clinically better after diuresis of ~1L in last 24h. Doubt sepsis given
   lack of symptoms, signs suggsting infxn. Weaned off pressors with
   diuresis and improved renal fxn
   -TTE demonstrates stable ICM, EF 25% and likely Class II pHTN
   -back off diuress today,goal TBB -500 today and plan to maintain MAP >
   55, reasonable UOP
   -HR control as below
   -f/u cx and resume ABX if any sign/ symptom suggesting infxn
   Oliguric acute renal failure- suspect cardiorenal plus poss contrast
   nephropathy; slowly improving
   -diuresis today and trend
   -renal US yest unremarkable
   Transaminitis- mild and increased yest; will re-check. Benign abd exam.
   CAD/ICM- 3VD of both native vessels and grafts, EF 25% as above
   - Continue Asa, Plavix, Lipitor
   - Resume BB today and cont to hold ACE-I
   Afib and heart block- s/p pacer w/ interrogation yest and pacer set
   -cont dig renally dosed to aid HR control
   Guaiac + stools
   - will need to address colonoscopy prior to dc since long-term anticoag
   will be likely (if not for afib then for low EF and LV aneurysm)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o, female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma visiting
   from [**Location (un) 9832**], originally admitted to MICU for PNA, hypercarbic
   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   Hypotension- I suspect more of a cardiorenal picture at this point,
   clinically better after diuresis of ~1L in last 24h. Doubt sepsis given
   lack of symptoms, signs suggsting infxn. Weaned off pressors with
   diuresis and improved renal fxn
   -TTE demonstrates stable ICM, EF 25% and likely Class II pHTN
   -back off diuress today,goal TBB -500 today and plan to maintain MAP >
   55, reasonable UOP
   -HR control as below
   -f/u cx and resume ABX if any sign/ symptom suggesting infxn
   Oliguric acute renal failure- suspect cardiorenal plus poss contrast
   nephropathy; slowly improving
   -diuresis today and trend
   -renal US yest unremarkable
   Transaminitis- mild and increased yest; will re-check. Benign abd exam.
   CAD/ICM- 3VD of both native vessels and grafts, EF 25% as above
   - Continue Asa, Plavix, Lipitor
   - Resume BB today and cont to hold ACE-I
   Afib and heart block- s/p pacer w/ interrogation yest and pacer set
   -cont dig renally dosed to aid HR control
   Guaiac + stools
   - will need to address colonoscopy prior to dc since long-term anticoag

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104**], MD
   on:[**2131-11-18**] 15:30 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and asthma, admitted to the MICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure, ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia, and afib with RVR. The patient has undergone several interventions, including catheterization, pacer placement, and diuresis.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 104 bpm
* Blood pressure: 133/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%
* Heart rhythm: AF

Physical examination:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no JVD at 85 degrees
* Respiratory: Crackles bibasilar, improved since yesterday
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 1+, left lower extremity edema 1+, 2+ LUE edema
* Skin: Cool
* Neurologic: Not assessed

Laboratory results:

* WBC: 16.0-24.3 K/uL
* Hct: 26.7-33.3%
* Plt: 163-310 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2-2.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 2.01-2.02 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 104-163 mg/dL
* Other labs: Elevated ALT, AST, and LDH, decreased albumin, and increased fibrinogen

Imaging:

* LUE Dopplers: Negative for DVT

Assessment and plan:

* Hypotension: Suspect cardiorenal picture, clinically better after diuresis of ~1L in the last 24 hours. Weaned off pressors with diuresis and improved renal function.
* Oliguric acute renal failure: Suspect cardiorenal plus possible contrast nephropathy; slowly improving.
* Transaminitis: Mild and increased yesterday; will re-check. Benign abdominal examination.
* CAD/ICM: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts, EF 25%.
* Afib and heart block: s/p pacer w/ interrogation yesterday and pacer set; continue digoxin renally dosed to aid HR control.
* Guaiac + stools: Will need to address colonoscopy prior to discharge since long-term anticoagulation will be likely (if not for afib then for low EF and LV aneurysm).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output may worsen if not properly managed.
* Contrast nephropathy: The patient's recent contrast exposure may lead to further kidney damage.
* Transaminitis: The patient's mild and increased transaminitis may worsen if not monitored and treated accordingly.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's afib and heart block may lead to further cardiac complications if not properly managed.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
* Sepsis: The patient's lack of symptoms and signs of infection may mask the development of sepsis.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's LUE Dopplers were negative, but it is essential to continue monitoring for DVT.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac + stools may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be addressed.
* Colonoscopy: The patient will need to undergo colonoscopy prior to discharge to evaluate for any potential gastrointestinal complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o, female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma visiting
   from [**Location (un) 9832**], originally admitted to MICU for PNA, hypercarbic
   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   Hypotension- I suspect more of a cardiorenal picture at this point,
   clinically better after diuresis of ~1L in last 24h. Doubt sepsis given
   lack of symptoms, signs suggsting infxn. Weaned off pressors with
   diuresis and improved renal fxn
   -TTE demonstrates stable ICM, EF 25% and likely Class II pHTN
   -back off diuress today,goal TBB -500 today and plan to maintain MAP >
   55, reasonable UOP
   -HR control as below
   -f/u cx and resume ABX if any sign/ symptom suggesting infxn
   Oliguric acute renal failure- suspect cardiorenal plus poss contrast
   nephropathy; slowly improving
   -diuresis today and trend
   -renal US yest unremarkable
   Transaminitis- mild and increased yest; will re-check. Benign abd exam.
   CAD/ICM- 3VD of both native vessels and grafts, EF 25% as above
   - Continue Asa, Plavix, Lipitor
   - Resume BB today and cont to hold ACE-I
   Afib and heart block- s/p pacer w/ interrogation yest and pacer set
   -cont dig renally dosed to aid HR control
   Guaiac + stools
   - will need to address colonoscopy prior to dc since long-term anticoag
   will be likely (if not for afib then for low EF and LV aneurysm)

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma, admitted to the ICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia, and afib with RVR. She was previously transferred from the MICU to the floor and then back to the ICU due to acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 104 bpm
* Blood pressure: 133/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 104 bpm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no JVD at 85 degrees
* Respiratory: Crackles in the bibasilar region, improved since yesterday
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: 1+, left lower extremity edema: 1+, 2+ LUE edema
* Skin: Cool
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, tone, and reflexes not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 16.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 163 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.01 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.1/41.3/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 97/5/2.02, ALT/AST: 185/276, Alk Phos/T Bili: 134/0.5, Amylase/Lipase: 89/0, Differential-Neuts: 89.1%, Lymph: 5.8%, Mono: 3.6%, Eos: 1.2%, Fibrinogen: 560 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.0 g/dL, LDH: 517 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's cardiorenal syndrome may worsen due to the presence of acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, and increased leukocytosis.
2. Contrast nephropathy: The patient's recent contrast exposure may have contributed to her acute kidney injury, and further deterioration of renal function is possible.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's mild transaminitis may progress to more severe liver damage if not addressed promptly.
4. Atrial fibrillation with heart block: The patient's atrial fibrillation with heart block may lead to hemodynamic instability, and further management is necessary to control her heart rate and rhythm.
5. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient's oliguric acute renal failure may progress to anuria if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
6. Sepsis: Although the patient does not exhibit symptoms or signs of infection, the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out, and further monitoring is necessary.
7. DVT: The patient's history of CAD and recent immobilization make her susceptible to developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and prophylactic measures should be continued.

Based on the patient's current condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue diuresis and monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels.
2. Adjust the patient's heart rate and rhythm management to ensure optimal hemodynamic stability.
3. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue prophylactic measures to prevent DVT and other complications.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider further imaging studies to rule out other underlying conditions contributing to the patient's symptoms.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her complex medical condition. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent potential complications and optimize her clinical outcomes."
