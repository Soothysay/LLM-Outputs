You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent right cecal mass resection. She presented post-operatively with fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath, and was found to have an abscess at the anastomosis site and a right pleural effusion. She underwent thoracentesis and insertion of posterior drains, and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She remains sedated and intubated, with ongoing leukocytosis and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's ongoing leukocytosis and abscess at the anastomosis site suggest that there may be ongoing infection and abscess formation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and her respiratory acidosis suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fever, leukocytosis, and abscess formation suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing hypotension and fluid overload suggest that she may be at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac failure.
6. Wound complications: The patient's ongoing abscess at the anastomosis site suggests that she may be at risk for wound complications, including infection and dehiscence.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ongoing need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and her potential for malnutrition suggest that she may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. She will also be monitored for signs of cardiac complications, wound complications, and nutritional deficiencies. The patient's antibiotics will be continued and adjusted as necessary. She will also be started on a diuretic to help manage her fluid overload. The patient's TPN will be continued and adjusted as necessary to ensure she is receiving adequate nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 75Fw/ hx AML and R cecal mass s/p R colectomy [**9-5**] presenting
   post-op with fever/leukocytosis/SOB found to have an abscess at the
   anastamosis site and R pleural effusion, underwent thoracentesis and IR
   guided placement of 2 posterior drains with persistent leukocytosis,
   now post-op diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal abscess/post-op: As above. Pt on mechanical ventilation. BP
   is stable without the need for pressors. Pt remains sedated with
   propofol.
   - cont. to bolus prn low uop (UOP >30cc/hr) or hypotension (MAP >65)
   - pain control with IV Dilaudid
   - cont. broad spectrum abx - Vanc/Pip-tazo (holding Vanco due to
   suprotherapeutic trough - repeat level in am)
   - Monitor drain outpt
   - Follow-up blood and fluid cultures
   - Trend Hct and transfuse <25
   - Cont. TPN
   .
   # Respiratory: Pt intubated on transfer. Pt is on PS 5/0 this AM
   - Monitor O/N, attempt to wean in am if possible
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely contrast nephropathy/ATN as creatinine
   bump [**9-18**] after IR placement of percutaneous drains. Baseline creat
   0.9, stabilized at 2.4, lytes has been wnl. Intraop w/ poor uop, now
   with approx 30cc/hr after small bolus which may indicate recovering
   renal fxn
   - cont. to monitor uop, bolus for low uop
   - follow lytes
   - renally dose meds (holding Vanco as above)
   .
   # R pleural effusion: Thoracentesis shortly after admission. Exudative.
   No evidence of infection or malignant cells, however appears to have
   reaccumulated. [**Month (only) 8**] require repeat thoracentesis if respiratory sx after
   extubation.
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology still pending
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed NO
   blast, c/w her known dx of MDS. Felt that her elevated WBC count was
   more likely due to known infection.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - appreciate Heme/Onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent right colectomy for a cecal mass. She developed an abscess at the anastomosis site and a right pleural effusion, which was treated with thoracentesis and insertion of posterior drains.

The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a stable blood pressure and normal sinus rhythm. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she has a mild respiratory alkalosis. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, but the peripheral smear does not show any blasts, which suggests that her elevated WBC count is likely due to an infection rather than a recurrence of her AML.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and a right pleural effusion that has reaccumulated. She also has a history of type II diabetes and is being treated with insulin.

The patient's current medications include propofol for sedation, heparin for prophylaxis, and antibiotics for the abscess. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has an abscess at the anastomosis site and a history of infection, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a mild respiratory alkalosis, which may increase her risk of developing ARDS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure and is at risk of developing AKI, especially if her creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, which increases her risk of developing pneumonia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and the presence of central lines.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and the presence of central lines.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk of developing further bleeding due to her anticoagulant therapy.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk of developing further infections, especially if her immune system is compromised.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical complications to prevent further deterioration and ensure her safe recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old female with history of AML with right cecal mass s/p R
   colectomy [**9-5**] presenting post-op with fever, leukocytosis, and SOB
   found to have an abscess at the anastamosis site as well as a right
   pleural effusion, who underwent thoracentesis and IR guided placement
   of 2 posterior drains with persistent leukocytosis, now post-op
   diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal abscess/post-op: Patient on mechanical ventilation post op
   with stable BP without the need for pressors. Pt remains sedated with
   propofol.  Pt with cont leukocytosis likely [**1-4**] intra-abdominal
   abscess, on broad spectrum abx. Initial path report shows lymphoid
   tissue, not malignant tissue. Further stains pending.
   - Continue to bolus prn low uop (UOP >30cc/hr) or hypotension (MAP >65)
   - Pain control with IV Dilaudid
   - Continue broad spectrum abx - Vanc/Pip-tazo.
     - Hold vancomycin due to elevated trough. Will redose according to
   worsening renal function
   - Monitor drain output
   - Follow-up blood and fluid cultures
 currently no growth to date
   - Trend Hct and transfuse <25
   - Continue TPN
   - Consult ID regarding possible infectious etiology for cecal mass
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated on transfer. Patient is comfortable on
   PS 10/5 this AM.  CXR appears pt with cont R pleural effusion and
   pulmonary edema.  Pt fluid overload.
   - Attempt to wean if possible, but could be limited by effusion
   - Consider gentle diuresis of 0.5-1 Liter. Check daily weights.
   - Consider thorocentesis if unable to wean off vent
   .
   # R pleural effusion: Thoracentesis shortly after admission. Exudative.
   No evidence of infection or malignant cells, however appears to have
   reaccumulated. [**Month (only) 8**] require repeat thoracentesis if respiratory symptoms
   after extubation or if unable to wean off the vent.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely contrast nephropathy/ATN as creatinine
   bump [**9-18**] after IR placement of percutaneous drains. Baseline creat
   0.9, continuing to trend up with Cr=2.7, BUN=38 today. Intraop w/ poor
   uop, with minimally improved foley output
   - Continue to monitor uop, bolus for low uop
   - Follow lytes. Get urine lytes.
   - Renally dose meds (holding Vanco as above)
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology still pending
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed NO
   blast, consistent with her known diagnosis of MDS. Felt that her
   elevated WBC count was more likely due to known infection.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has a persistently elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The initial path report shows lymphoid tissue, but further stains are pending. This suggests that the patient may still have an intra-abdominal abscess, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.7 mg/dL, which is consistent with ATN. This could be related to contrast nephropathy or another underlying condition. The patient's urine output is minimal, and they are not responding to fluid boluses.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has a right pleural effusion, which may be contributing to their respiratory distress. The CXR shows pulmonary edema, which could be related to fluid overload. The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further if they are unable to be weaned off the ventilator.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and ongoing infection may put them at risk for sepsis. This could lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal failure.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of AML and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. This may increase their risk of bleeding complications, particularly if they have an underlying coagulopathy.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which may not be providing adequate nutrition. This could lead to malnutrition and further compromise their immune function.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not addressed.

Based on these potential complications, the patient's care plan should focus on:

1. Managing the intra-abdominal abscess and sepsis.
2. Improving the patient's renal function and urine output.
3. Weaning the patient off the ventilator and managing their respiratory status.
4. Monitoring the patient's bleeding risk and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
5. Providing adequate nutrition and managing electrolyte imbalances.
6. Monitoring the patient's overall condition and adjusting their care plan as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a cecal mass diagnosed as lymphoid. They have a history of allergies to Lisinopril, Aspirin, and Antibiotics. The patient has been receiving various medications, including Propofol, Hydromorphone, and Heparin. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/46 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 383 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, indicating potential kidney and liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. This may lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's lymphoid cecal mass and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. This could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate and tidal volume may indicate respiratory failure. This could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate cardiac dysfunction. This could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cecal mass and lack of bowel sounds may indicate gastrointestinal dysfunction. This could lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and increased risk of sepsis.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yr old woman with hx of AML tx with chemo [**2173**], right cecal mass
   resected [**2177-9-5**]. Postop presented with fever, SOB, leukocytosis. CT
   abd showed air around anastomosis and a right pleural effusion.
   Thoracentesis c/w exudate, cultures negative. Wbc progressively
   increased. Yesterday had diverting loop enterostomy with drain inserted
   at site of anastomosis. Operative course with low u/o. Postop
   hypotension, administered LR and transfused 2 u prbc, ffp. Transferred
   intubated, on vanco/zosyn/fluconazole. Currently responding to IV
   crystaloid with improved u/o.
   Complicated case with hx of AML, MDS, now cecal mass resected (lymphoid
   tissue, no malignancy per prelim report) with post-op course
   complicated by hypotension, likely hypovolemic, acute renal failure,
   exudative pleural effusion (LDH 1154, no organisms, cytology neg), and
   acute resp failure.
   - Acute respiratory failure
 remains vent dependent, will check SBT
   today, will likely need repeat thoracentesis, possible extubation next
   24 hrs.
   - CVS - echo pending
   Acute renal failure - felt to be contrast-induced, renal service
   consulted, u/o improving, will diurese gently and aim for negative
   fluid balance.
   - ID
 etiology of lymphoid mass unclear but suggests systemic
   infection. Will ask ID to get involved. Continue vanco (dose by level,
   keep 15-20) and Zosyn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and resection of a right cecal mass. She developed postoperative complications, including fever, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis. Thoracentesis revealed an exudative pleural effusion, and she was transferred to the ICU intubated and on vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole. She has been responding to IV crystalloid with improved urine output. Current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator-dependent and may require repeat thoracentesis and possible extubation in the next 24 hours.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has experienced postoperative hypotension and may require further management to stabilize her blood pressure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, which may be related to contrast-induced nephropathy. Renal service has been consulted, and the patient will be managed with gentle diuresis and aimed at negative fluid balance.
4. Infection: The patient has a lymphoid mass with unclear etiology, which may suggest systemic infection. Infectious disease consultation has been requested, and the patient will continue to receive vancomycin and zosyn.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a diverting loop enterostomy with a drain inserted at the site of anastomosis, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or obstruction.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is critically ill and may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and may be at risk for metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address her various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment with chemotherapy, who underwent resection of a right cecal mass. Postoperatively, she developed fever, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed air around the anastomosis and a right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis revealed an exudate, and cultures were negative. She was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma due to postoperative hypotension. She was intubated and received vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole.

The patient's current condition is complicated by acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and acute renal failure, with a pending echo for cardiac evaluation. She also has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which may require therapeutic thoracentesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress, requiring increased ventilator support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis.
3. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and respiratory failure increase the risk of infection, which may require antibiotic therapy and further evaluation.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is pending echo evaluation, but may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of AML and recent surgery increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and requirement for mechanical ventilation may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can impact her overall health and recovery.
7. Psychological and emotional distress: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay may cause psychological and emotional distress, which can impact her recovery and quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old female with history of AML with right cecal mass s/p R
   colectomy [**9-5**] presenting post-op with fever, leukocytosis, and SOB
   found to have an abscess at the anastamosis site as well as a right
   pleural effusion, who underwent thoracentesis and IR guided placement
   of 2 posterior drains with persistent leukocytosis, now post-op
   diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal abscess/post-op: Patient on mechanical ventilation post op
   with stable BP without the need for pressors. Pt remains sedated with
   propofol.  Pt with cont leukocytosis likely [**1-4**] intra-abdominal
   abscess, on broad spectrum abx. Initial path report shows lymphoid
   tissue, not malignant tissue. Further stains pending.
   - Continue to bolus prn low uop (UOP >30cc/hr) or hypotension (MAP >65)
   - Pain control with IV Dilaudid
   - Continue broad spectrum abx - Vanc/Pip-tazo.
     - Hold vancomycin due to elevated trough. Will redose according to
   worsening renal function
   - Monitor drain output
   - Follow-up blood and fluid cultures
 currently no growth to date
   - Consult ID regarding possible infectious etiology for cecal mass
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient intubated on transfer. Patient is comfortable on
   PS 10/5 this AM.  CXR show unchanged to slightly improved right pleural
   effusion and pulmonary edema.  Pt fluid overloaded.
   - SBT this morning, followed by possible thoracentesis.
   - Attempt to wean if possible, but could be limited by effusion
   - Gentle diuresis of 0.5-1 Liter. Check daily weights.
   .
   # R pleural effusion: Thoracentesis shortly after admission. Exudative.
   No evidence of infection or malignant cells, however appears to have
   reaccumulated. [**Month (only) 8**] require repeat thoracentesis if respiratory symptoms
   after extubation or if unable to wean off the vent.
   - Likely thoracentesis today in PM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely contrast nephropathy/ATN as creatinine
   bump [**9-18**] after IR placement of percutaneous drains. Baseline creat
   0.9, continuing to trend up with Cr=2.7, BUN=38 today. Intraop w/ poor
   uop, with minimally improved foley output
   - Continue to monitor uop, bolus for low uop
   - Follow lytes. Get urine lytes.
   - Renally dose meds (holding Vanco as above)
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology still pending
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed NO
   blast, consistent with her known diagnosis of MDS. Felt that her
   elevated WBC count was more likely due to known infection.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 75-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a right cecal mass. She underwent right colectomy and was found to have an abscess at the anastomosis site and a right pleural effusion. The patient was intubated on transfer and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/46 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a history of acute renal failure, likely due to contrast nephropathy/ATN, and is currently being treated with renally dosed medications. Her urine output is being closely monitored, and she is receiving gentle diuresis of 0.5-1 liter daily.

The patient's abdominal abscess is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pathology reports indicate lymphoid tissue, not malignant tissue. Further stains are pending.

The patient's pleural effusion is being managed with thoracentesis, and she is at risk for reaccumulation. The patient's cecal mass is pending pathology results.

The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is being managed with insulin sliding scale therapy. She is also being monitored for potential infectious etiologies for her cecal mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's cecal mass and abscess may be infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pleural effusion and respiratory compromise may lead to respiratory failure, requiring further ventilatory support.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed effectively.
4. Sepsis: The patient's infection may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal abscess and cecal mass may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications that can arise, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.
   - If resp status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. The patient is currently extubated and off supplemental oxygen, but has a large right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC trending down to 36
* Creatinine stable at 2.9
* Electrolytes within normal range
* Albumin 2.2 g/dL
* Calcium 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* AML with cecal mass
* Anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation
* Right pleural effusion
* Acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and ATN rather than CIN
* Type II diabetes
* FEN (fistula-in-ano)

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin (hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose when level <15)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) (renally dosed)
* Furosemide (Lasix) (avoided due to ARF)
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis)
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Insulin in TPN

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of ARF
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count of 97
* Further complications from the pleural effusion
* Recurrence of AML
* Development of secondary infections due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression

The patient's current plan of care includes:

* Monitoring drain output
* Continuing broad antibiotic coverage
* Following up on cultures
* Monitoring UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP, and bolus IVF as necessary
* Avoiding diuresis
* Renally dosing medications
* Avoiding nephrotoxins
* Discussing with pathology and ID consult to determine the cause of the cecal mass
* Following up on final path report
* Transfusing HCT <25
* Appreciating Heme/Onc recs

I recommend that the patient's care be continued in the ICU with close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.
   - If resp status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction
   .
   # Access: PICC RAC, PIV LAC, R radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. She has been extubated and is currently off supplemental oxygen. The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which is consistent with an exudative process with culture and cytology negative results. Her creatinine level is stable at 2.9 mg/dL, and the renal team suspects that acute renal failure is likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation: The patient's cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy is complicated by anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation, which increases the risk of infection and sepsis.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's creatinine level is stable, but the renal team suspects that ATN is contributing to her acute renal failure. ATN can lead to chronic kidney disease and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to infection or may be a sign of recurrence of her AML. Leukocytosis can increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient's large right-sided pleural effusion may be causing respiratory distress and may require repeat thoracentesis.
5. Type II diabetes: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is receiving insulin in her total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This increases the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status may decline, and she may develop ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
7. Sepsis: The patient's infection and abscess formation increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

**Plan:**

1. Monitor drain output and adjust antibiotic coverage as necessary.
2. Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn).
3. Hold vancomycin dose until the level is <15.
4. Follow-up cultures to determine the presence of infection.
5. Monitor urine output, mentation, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and bolus IV fluid as necessary.
6. Monitor creatinine, electrolytes, and UOP to assess kidney function.
7. Avoid diuresis and nephrotoxins.
8. Consider repeat thoracentesis if respiratory status declines.
9. Discuss with pathology to add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and Yersenia, and follow-up final path report.
10. Recommend transfusing HCT <25 to manage leukocytosis.
11. Appreciate Heme/Onc recs and continue to monitor the patient's AML/MDS status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.
   - If resp status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction
   .
   # Access: PICC RAC, PIV LAC, R radial arterial line
   .
   # PPx: heparin SQ and PPI
   .
   # Code: Full, confirmed with husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1904**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1907**], ICU
   .
   # Dispo: Can likely call out this afternoon.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation.
* She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath.
* The patient is extubated and off supplemental oxygen, but has a large right-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis.
* Her creatinine is stable at 2.9 mg/dL, and acute renal failure is likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).
* The patient has a history of type II diabetes, and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with insulin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient has a history of abscess formation and is at risk for further infection, particularly with the presence of a cecal mass and anastomosis site leakage.
2. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN):** The patient's creatinine is stable, but ATN is a potential complication of intraoperative fluid shifts and may require further management.
3. **Pleural Effusion:** The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis, which may require repeat thoracentesis if respiratory status declines.
4. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to infection or a recurrence of AML, and requires further evaluation and management.
5. **Diabetes Complications:** The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is receiving TPN with insulin, which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
6. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient is receiving TPN, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly managed.
7. **Cecal Mass:** The patient's cecal mass may require further evaluation and management, including stool tests for Yersinia and serology for Entamoeba histolytica.

**Plan:**

* Monitor drain output and follow-up cultures
* Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
* Hold vancomycin dose until level <15
* Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP, and bolus IVF as necessary
* Evaluate and manage pleural effusion as needed
* Monitor creatinine and electrolytes
* Avoid diuresis and nephrotoxins
* Consider repeat thoracentesis if respiratory status declines
* Follow-up with pathology for final report on cecal mass
* Discuss with Heme/Onc regarding leukocytosis and potential recurrence of AML
* Manage diabetes and nutritional deficiencies as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.  TTE ordered from last week to assess LV
   function pre-extubation performed this AM.
   - If respiratory status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   - Follow-up TTE results.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Follow-up onc recs if any
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction
   .
   # Access: PICC RAC, PIV LAC, R radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation. She was admitted to the ICU for post-op fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 160/64 mmHg. She is extubated and off supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) trending down to 36
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT) 97
* Creatinine (Cr) 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL
* Serum albumin 2.2 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++) 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++) 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4) 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
* Leukocytosis likely secondary to infection in the post-operative setting
* Type II diabetes
* MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring drain output
* Continuing broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
* Holding vancomycin dose today and rechecking tomorrow and dosing when the level is <15
* Following up cultures
* Monitoring UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP, and bolus IVF as necessary
* Avoiding diuresis
* Renally dosing medications and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Monitoring creatinine, electrolytes, and UOP
* Considering repeat thoracentesis if respiratory status declines
* Following up TTE results

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and abscess formation suggest a high risk of infection. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and cultures is essential to detect any signs of infection early.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's large right-sided pleural effusion and history of respiratory failure make her at risk for ARDS.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ARF and history of intraoperative fluid shifts increase her risk for AKI.
* Sepsis: The patient's high risk of infection and underlying medical conditions make her at risk for sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation increases her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding."
