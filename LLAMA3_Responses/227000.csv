   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial:
   1) vasovagal response during chemo
   2) volume depletion (in the setting of chemotherapy and poor PO intake)
   3) sepsis (given her leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fever)
   presumed source urinary or gastroentestinal.
   4) PEs (but very small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   5) adrenal insufficiency (given history of metastases to adrenals, TB
   and lower than expected cortisol 8.6)
   6) tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   - Repleting steroid at sepsis dose given known h/o TB, adrenal mets and
   cortisol lower than would be expected in sepsis (8.6)
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14. No TR or RV
   dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u final read. NS per CVP <8 as
   tolerated by respiratory status.
   - Continue broad coverage: CTX, vanco, cipro, and f/u cultures
   (currently GNR in blood from [**3-14**] and [**3-15**])
   - Repeat CXR with evidence of fluid overload
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   - Given metastases, small size, and need for procedures, holding
   heparin at present.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient flips between sinus tachycardia (rate 90-120) to
   what appears to be atrial fibrillation vs MAT with rate >140s. Line
   appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm for certainty without
   change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and amiodarone.
   - cont amiodarone
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Resolved. Suspect this may have been secondary
   to the tachycardia. No evidence of PNA on CXR. Patient does have small
   subsegmental PE's, however no significant hypoxia or tachynpea.
   - Serial CXRs for evidence of fluid overload.
   - Anticoagulation held for initial concern of facial asymmetry/ICB (CT
   neg)
   - on pneumoboots, can consider lovenox
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Pt anuric, Cr up to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of
   hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   .
   # Abdominal discomfort, nausea: Could have been secondary to
   chemotherapy, or possibly indolent gastroenteritis.
   - Checking C. difficile toxin, anti-emetics, morphine
   - Consider additional abdominal imaging once patient is more stable
   .
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy
   - Continue Levoxyl
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia: continue omeprazole, anti-emetics prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial:
   1) vasovagal response during chemo
   2) volume depletion (in the setting of chemotherapy and poor PO intake)
   3) sepsis (given her leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fever)
   presumed source urinary or gastroentestinal.
   4) PEs (but very small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   5) adrenal insufficiency (given history of metastases to adrenals, TB
   and lower than expected cortisol 8.6)
   6) tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   - Repleting steroid at sepsis dose given known h/o TB, adrenal mets and
   cortisol lower than would be expected in sepsis (8.6)
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14. No TR or RV
   dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u final read. NS per CVP <8 as
   tolerated by respiratory status.
   - Continue broad coverage: CTX, vanco, cipro, and f/u cultures
   (currently GNR in blood from [**3-14**] and [**3-15**])
   - Repeat CXR with evidence of fluid overload
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   - Given metastases, small size, and need for procedures, holding
   heparin at present.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient flips between sinus tachycardia (rate 90-120) to
   what appears to be atrial fibrillation vs MAT with rate >140s. Line
   appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm for certainty without
   change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and amiodarone.
   - cont amiodarone
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Resolved. Suspect this may have been secondary
   to the tachycardia. No evidence of PNA on CXR. Patient does have small
   subsegmental PE's, however no significant hypoxia or tachynpea.
   - Serial CXRs for evidence of fluid overload.
   - Anticoagulation held for initial concern of facial asymmetry/ICB (CT
   neg)
   - on pneumoboots, can consider lovenox
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Pt anuric, Cr up to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of
   hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   .
   # Abdominal discomfort, nausea: Could have been secondary to
   chemotherapy, or possibly indolent gastroenteritis.
   - Checking C. difficile toxin, anti-emetics, morphine
   - Consider additional abdominal imaging once patient is more stable

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, known brain mets, and adrenal mets, who presented with nausea and hypotension. She was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, with concerns of sepsis vs effects of metastatic cancer.

The patient's condition has improved overnight with decreased requirement of levophed, but she remains anuric. Her lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 158 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Lactate: 1.7 mmol/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* BUN: 30 mg/dL
* Sodium: 132 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypotension: likely multifactorial, including vasovagal response, volume depletion, sepsis, PEs, adrenal insufficiency, and tachycardia
* Tachycardia: possibly due to atrial fibrillation, MAT, or sinus tachycardia
* Respiratory distress: resolved, possibly secondary to tachycardia
* Anuria: likely due to hypovolemia and ATN
* Abdominal discomfort and nausea: possibly secondary to chemotherapy or indolent gastroenteritis
* Metastatic melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine
* Hypertension: holding home BP medications
* Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy, continuing Levoxyl
* GERD/hiatal hernia: continuing omeprazole and anti-emetics prn

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Hydrocortisone Na Succ. 50 mg IV Q6H for septic shock
* Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO DAILY
* Lorazepam 0.25-0.5 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Metoprolol Tartrate 5 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Morphine Sulfate 2 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Norepinephrine 0.03-0.25 mcg/kg/min IV DRIP TITRATE TO MAP >65
* Amiodarone 150 mg IV BOLUS ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
* Ondansetron 4-8 mg IV Q8H:PRN
* Pneumococcal Vac Polyvalent 0.5 ml IM ASDIR
* Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV Q6H:PRN
* Senna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN
* CeftriaXONE 1 g IV Q24H
* Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Vancomycin 1000 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses
* Fentanyl Citrate 12.5-25 mcg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fever
* ATN: given the patient's anuria and hypovolemia
* Adrenal insufficiency: given the patient's history of metastases to adrenals and low cortisol levels
* Respiratory failure: given the patient's respiratory distress and possible underlying lung disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias: given the patient's tachycardia and possible underlying cardiac disease

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill
   T<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, undergoing chemotherapy and experiencing hypotension, respiratory distress, and sepsis. The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is currently receiving treatment for presumptive sepsis with GNR UTI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient is already experiencing multiorgan failure, including respiratory distress, acute renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular instability. There is a risk of further deterioration of organ function if sepsis is not effectively managed.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiovascular instability. The patient is currently receiving stress-dose steroids, but there is a risk of adrenal crisis if the patient's condition worsens.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient is oliguric and has acute renal insufficiency, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is receiving oxygen therapy. There is a risk of further deterioration of respiratory function if not managed properly, which can lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, which can lead to cardiovascular instability and the need for vasopressors. There is a risk of further deterioration of cardiovascular function if not managed properly.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which can be exacerbated by the patient's condition and treatment.
7. Infection: The patient has a GNR UTI and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and multiorgan failure.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function. The patient should continue to receive stress-dose steroids to manage adrenal insufficiency, and her antibiotic regimen should be adjusted based on the results of her urine cultures. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that the patient does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if her heart or breathing stops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, an 81-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for metastatic melanoma with brain and adrenal metastases, presenting with nausea, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is concerning for sepsis versus effects of metastatic cancer.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 72-121 bpm
* Blood pressure: 95/50 mmHg (67-141/123 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has been treated with various medications, including levophed, amiodarone, and ciprofloxacin. She has also received blood products, including platelets, and has been managed with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5-18.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6-9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 85-120 K/uL

* Cardiac: Irregular, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs
* Abd: Slightly distended but soft, +BS (bowel sounds present)
* Extr: Warm, 1+ edema bilaterally, no cyanosis or clubbing
* Neuro: Waxing and waning mental status, moves all extremities equally

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: likely multifactorial, including urosepsis, volume depletion, and tachycardia
* Tachycardia: patient flips between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation
* Thrombocytopenia: suspect drug effect from Vancomycin, now discontinued
* Anuria: patient is anuric, with creatinine up to 1.6 mg/dL, likely due to ATN in the setting of hypovolemia
* Metastatic melanoma: patient is being treated with chemotherapy and is being followed by an oncologist
* Hypertension: patient's home blood pressure medications are being held
* Hypothyroidism: patient is taking Levoxyl
* GERD/hiatal hernia: patient is being treated with omeprazole and anti-emetics as needed

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: patient is receiving enteral nutrition
* Glycemic control: patient's glucose levels are being monitored and managed as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial:
   1) urosepsis GNR in urine and blood
   2) volume depletion (in the setting of chemotherapy and poor PO intake)
   3) adrenal insufficiency (given history of metastases to adrenals, TB
   and lower than expected cortisol 8.6)
   4) tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   Less likely vasovagal response during chemo and effects of PEs as very
   small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   - Continue broad gram negative coverage: CTX, cipro, and f/u cultures
   and sensis
   - stop Vancomycin
   - Repleting steroid at sepsis dose given known h/o TB, adrenal mets and
   cortisol lower than would be expected in sepsis
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
   # Tachycardia: Patient flips between sinus tachycardia (rate 90-120) to
   what appears to be atrial fibrillation vs MAT with rate >140s. Line
   appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm for certainty without
   change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and amiodarone.
   - cont amiodarone today and hopefully stop tomorrow
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   - recheck coags and dw oncology re urgency or need to anticoagulate.
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Pt anuric, Cr up to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of
   hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, is being treated in the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, with concerns for sepsis vs effects of metastatic cancer. The patient's condition has improved overnight with decreased requirement of levophed, but she remains anuric.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's anuria and increasing creatinine levels (up to 1.6) suggest acute kidney injury, which can progress to ARF if not managed promptly.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels (6.6 mg/dL) may be contributing to her hypotension and tachycardia, and may require urgent correction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 100%) may indicate respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and possible atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
6. Metastatic melanoma progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected urosepsis
2. Replenishing steroids at sepsis dose due to known adrenal metastases and low cortisol levels
3. Fluid resuscitation with CVP monitoring
4. Amiodarone for tachycardia control
5. Renal dose medications to avoid further kidney damage
6. Pain control with tylenol and morphine
7. Regular coagulation studies and consultation with oncology regarding anticoagulation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who has developed sepsis due to E. coli UTI, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and an ABG of 18 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not yet responding to treatment, and there is a risk of progression to septic shock.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, leading to complications such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may not improve, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may not be fully corrected, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle cramps.
6. Shock: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of DVT.
9. Stress Ulcer: The patient's stress and illness may increase the risk of stress ulcer bleeding.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and illness may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function."

   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION - Likely multifactorial: urosepsis
   GNR in urine and blood, volume depletion (in the setting of
   chemotherapy and poor PO intake), tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   Less likely vasovagal response during chemo and effects of PEs as very
   small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and
   amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now rate-controlled
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - Trend plts for now
   - No plan to start argatroban as pt
s HIT probability unlikely
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt oligouric, Cr up
   to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION - Likely multifactorial: urosepsis
   GNR in urine and blood, volume depletion (in the setting of
   chemotherapy and poor PO intake), tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   Less likely vasovagal response during chemo and effects of PEs as very
   small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and
   amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now rate-controlled
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - Trend plts for now
   - No plan to start argatroban as pt
s HIT probability unlikely
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt oligouric, Cr up
   to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.
   # Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, is being treated in the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has improved overnight, with decreased requirement of levophed and continued anuria.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 6 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.0%
* Platelet count (Plt): 81 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20 mEq/L
* Sodium (Na): 134 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.1 mEq/L
* Chloride (Cl): 105 mEq/L
* Calcium (Ca): 6.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg): 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is sepsis without organ dysfunction, likely multifactorial, and may be related to urosepsis, volume depletion, and tachycardia. The patient's tachycardia is likely atrial fibrillation (AFIB), which is responsive to fluids and amiodarone. The patient's thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to drug effect from Vancomycin, which has been discontinued.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and the patient is oliguric. The patient's oncologist is following, and the patient's medications have been adjusted accordingly.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely multifactorial and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function may progress to acute renal failure (ARF) if not managed properly.
3. Tachycardia/Atrial fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia/AFIB may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiovascular complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Metastatic melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma may progress and worsen if not properly managed.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed.
7. GERD/hiatal hernia: The patient's GERD/hiatal hernia may worsen if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, known brain and adrenal mets, who presented with nausea and hypotension. She was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, suspected to be caused by sepsis or the effects of metastatic cancer. Overnight, she improved with decreased requirement of levophed, but continued to experience anuria.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD/hiatal hernia, and is currently receiving treatment for metastatic melanoma. She is being treated with antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, and is receiving fluid resuscitation with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13-14 mmHg. She is also receiving stress dose steroids and has a history of thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, are concerning for sepsis. The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels also suggest potential kidney damage.
2. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma is a significant risk factor for developing complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure.
3. Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia and atrial fibrillation may be a result of sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects. The patient's heart rhythm is unstable, and further monitoring is necessary to ensure cardiac stability.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest potential renal failure. The patient's history of metastatic melanoma and sepsis also increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be a result of medication side effects, sepsis, or metastatic melanoma. The patient's platelet count is low, and further monitoring is necessary to ensure bleeding risk.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia suggest potential respiratory failure. The patient's history of metastatic melanoma and sepsis also increase the risk of respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and adjust dosing as necessary based on blood cultures and patient response.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication as necessary to ensure cardiac stability.
3. Continue fluid resuscitation and monitor the patient's CVP and urine output to ensure renal function.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust medication as necessary to ensure bleeding risk.
5. Continue stress dose steroids and monitor the patient's cortisol levels.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

Mrs. [**Known Lastname**], an 81-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, possibly due to sepsis or metastatic cancer. She has a history of metastatic melanoma with brain and adrenal metastases. Overnight, her condition improved with decreased requirement of levophed, but she continued to have anuria. She is currently receiving fluids, antibiotics, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of metastatic cancer and recent antibiotics, sepsis is a possibility. The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress may be indicative of sepsis.
2. Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate has been fluctuating between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which may be a sign of cardiac instability. The patient's response to fluids, metoprolol, and amiodarone suggests that these conditions may be related to fluid overload or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 1.7, and she is starting to show signs of increased urine output, which may indicate acute renal failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to drug effect from Vancomycin or secondary to dacarbazine.
5. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's cancer is progressing, and she is at risk for further complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is being held on home medications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being treated with Levoxyl.
8. GERD/Hiatal Hernia: The patient has a history of GERD and hiatal hernia and is being treated with omeprazole and anti-emetics.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to provide fluid resuscitation and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including echocardiogram and Holter monitor.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
5. Continue to treat the patient's metastatic melanoma with oncological care.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting medications as needed.
7. Continue to treat the patient's hypothyroidism with Levoxyl.
8. Monitor the patient's GERD/hiatal hernia symptoms and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of melanoma who presented with e-coli sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, and her condition has been managed with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/54 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, with a count of 12.5 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 43 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase level of 180 IU/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to e-coli sepsis, which is being managed with antibiotics.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is being managed with fluids and vasopressors.
3. Afib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with lopressor.
4. PE: The patient has a pulmonary embolism, which is being managed with heparin.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to the sepsis or acute renal failure.
6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to the sepsis or acute renal failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue IV cipro for 14 days to manage the sepsis.
2. Recheck blood cultures to assure clearance of bacteremia.
3. Transition to lovenox once renal function improves to manage the pulmonary embolism.
4. Continue lopressor to manage the atrial fibrillation.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the fluid management accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust the management of the sepsis accordingly.
7. Plan to transfer the patient to the floor once her condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of melanoma who presented with e.coli sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/54 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL and a lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. The patient's creatinine level is trending down, indicating improvement in acute renal failure.

The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, and is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol and lopressor.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Atrial fibrillation-related complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
4. UTI recurrence: The patient's UTI can recur, leading to further complications, including sepsis and acute kidney injury.
5. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin can increase the risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, or intracranial hemorrhage.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive IV antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as directed. The patient's laboratory results should be closely monitored, and adjustments made as necessary to optimize their care. The patient's atrial fibrillation should be closely monitored for signs of worsening, and the patient should be educated on the importance of seeking medical attention if they experience any symptoms of stroke or heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to E. coli sepsis and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has a history of melanoma and has been treated with ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/54 mmHg. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 100% and is receiving IV fluids.

Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen, and her extremities are warm. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Lab results show anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, as well as elevated lactate levels and decreased albumin levels. Her renal function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not adequately managed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate, leading to seizures, coma, or other neurological complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may deteriorate, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, or other complications.
7. Infection: The patient may develop secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
8. Thromboembolic events: The patient may develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of anticoagulant therapy."

   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 UROSEPSIS:
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
 continue cipro 400 IV q12
   day # 5
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
ed x 48hrs
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
   - Wean stress dose steroids to hydrocortisone 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u blood cx, ensure pt cleared infection
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids,
   metoprolol and amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now off but continues to flip into
   tachycardia.
   - stable on metop 12.5 TID
   - repleting calcium now that ceftriaxone out of system
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # [**Name (NI) 4860**] PE
 pt now being treated w/ heparin gtt, pt will likely
   start lovenox tomorrow, holding off for now as pt
s renal function
   still not at baseline yet.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - continue to trend
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Cr peaked at 1.7
   from 1, now 1.4. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.  Starting to
   have increased UOP.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, known brain and adrenal metastases, who was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Overnight, the patient improved with decreased requirement of levophed, but continued to have anuria. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, and the patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin for urosepsis. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with metoprolol and amiodarone. The patient is being treated with heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and the oncologist is following the patient's metastatic melanoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with urosepsis, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, which can lead to cardiac complications if not properly managed.
6. Metastatic melanoma progression: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which can progress if not properly managed with chemotherapy and other treatments.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient has respiratory distress, which can worsen if not properly managed with oxygen therapy and other respiratory support measures.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend that the healthcare team continues to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition closely and makes adjustments to the patient's treatment plan as necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

Mrs. [**Known lastname **], an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma (known brain mets, adrenal mets), was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic cancer. Overnight, she improved with decreased requirement of levophed, but continued anuria. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and GERD/hiatal hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is concerning for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level peaked at 1.7 mg/dL, indicating potential ARF. This can be caused by hypovolemia, which is common in patients with metastatic cancer.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which can lead to muscle cramps, tingling, and weakness.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which can be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or metabolic disturbances.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's ECG shows AFib, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
7. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's cancer is progressing, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and decreased quality of life.
8. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
9. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and decreased perfusion.
10. Anuria: The patient's urine output is zero, which can indicate renal failure or other underlying medical conditions.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan includes:

* Narrowing antibiotics to ciprofloxacin for urosepsis
* Continuing ciprofloxacin IV q12
* Weaning stress dose steroids to hydrocortisone 25 mg
* F/u blood cultures to ensure clearance of infection
* Monitoring and managing tachycardia and AFib
* Repleting calcium and managing hypocalcemia
* Renally dosing medications to avoid further kidney damage
* Avoiding contrast and toxins to prevent further kidney damage
* Continuing to trend platelet counts and managing thrombocytopenia
* Following up with the patient's oncologist to manage metastatic melanoma
* Managing respiratory distress and hypotension
* Monitoring urine output and managing anuria."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 109 bpm (91-117 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 129/78 mmHg (90/51-148/91 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving levophed, and the requirement has decreased overnight.

The patient has the following medical conditions:

* Metastatic melanoma with brain and adrenal mets
* Renal failure, acute (ATN)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium)
* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
* Tachycardia
* Anuria

The patient has the following laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 75 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.4 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 2720 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Ciprofloxacin (400 IV q12)
* Vancomycin (d/c)
* Levophed (decreased requirement overnight)
* Metoprolol (12.5 TID)
* Amiodarone (completed loading dose)
* Tylenol and morphine for pain control
* Lovenox (start)
* Heparin gtt (start)
* Levoxyl (continue)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis progressing to septic shock
* Renal failure worsening to end-stage renal disease
* Hypocalcemia causing cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness
* Atrial fibrillation worsening to ventricular fibrillation
* Tachycardia causing cardiac strain
* Anuria worsening to complete kidney failure
* Metastatic melanoma progression and worsening symptoms
* Thrombocytopenia worsening to bleeding complications

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Narrowed antibiotics to ciprofloxacin (400 IV q12)
* Continue levophed only if necessary
* Wean stress dose steroids to hydrocortisone 25 mg
* Follow-up blood cultures to ensure clearance of infection
* Continue metoprolol and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Replenish calcium
* Pain control via tylenol and morphine
* Start lovenox and d/c heparin gtt as renal function normalizes
* Trend platelet count
* Continue Levoxyl for hypothyroidism
* Continue omeprazole and anti-emetics for GERD and hiatal hernia
* Monitor for signs of sepsis, renal failure, and other complications."
