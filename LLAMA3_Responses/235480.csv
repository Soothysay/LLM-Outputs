   Imaging: CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

         REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Female First Name (un) 12729**] [**Doctor Last Name 12730**] @ 6:36A [**2110-11-7**].
         GRAM NEGATIVE RODS.
   ECG: 96 sinus, regular. RBBB. Normal intervals. Similar compared to
   prior on [**2110-12-14**].
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo with a ESRD on HD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for
   incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia recently
   on Vancomycin and Meropenem, who presents with dyspnea while at HD.
   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear
   large infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, he should be covered
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on Vancomycin and Meropenem
   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.
   -Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   -Oseltamavir
   -Influenza DFA
   -droplet precautions
   -r/o MI with CEs
   -f/u Blood cultures
   -repeat CXR in AM
   Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   -f/u blood cultures
   -continue Vancomycin and Meropenem per above for HAP coverage
   -consult ID in the AM
   ESRD on HD
   Nephrology is aware of the patient.
   -continue Sevelamer
   -renally dose medications
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   CAD
   -r/o MI as above. Low suspicion.
   -continue ASA, statin
   -hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   -continue coumadin
   -monitor INR: goal [**2-25**]
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Not documented, but patient on Keppra as an outpatient.
   -continue Keppra at outpatient doses
   -continue zonisamide

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   61 yo with a ESRD on HD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for
   incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia recently
   on Vancomycin and Meropenem, who presents with dyspnea while at HD.
   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear
   large infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, he should be covered
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on Vancomycin and Meropenem
   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe shortness of breath. He has a history of incarcerated hernia and recently developed ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which was treated with Vancomycin and Meropenem. The patient's current condition is characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea, and a large infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): Given the patient's recent hospitalization and prolonged stay, he is at risk for developing HAP. The CXR shows a large infiltrate, which may be indicative of pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and dyspnea may indicate respiratory failure, which could worsen his condition if not addressed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease, which may increase his risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction (MI) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Sepsis: The patient's ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk for complications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's ESRD and HD may increase his risk for fluid overload, which could exacerbate his dyspnea and other symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and prolonged stay may increase his risk for infection, particularly with antibiotic-resistant organisms such as ESBL-producing Klebsiella.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizure disorder and cerebrovascular disease may increase his risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is being treated with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Meropenem for HAP, and Oseltamavir for possible influenza. He is also being treated with anticoagulation therapy for CAD and cerebrovascular disease. The patient's blood cultures will be monitored, and he will be re-evaluated in the morning. The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and his code status has been set to full code."

   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on abx until [**2111-1-28**] developed SOB
   at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR c L lung
   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear
   large infiltrate. Given recent hospitalization, he should be covered
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on Vancomycin and Meropenem
   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   Dyspnea
   Differential includes bacteria and viral pneumonia. CXR shows clear

   for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would add Levofloxacin for better
   pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1 vaccine, however given
   tachypnea, would empirically treat with oseltamavir. Differential
   always includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo
   from [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. Given that the patient was at HD, it is
   possible that fluid overload is contributing to dyspnea.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, multiple cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic hepatitis B, and a recent hospitalization for hernia repair and abscess with ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. He developed respiratory failure in the emergency department and was intubated. He has a clear large infiltrate on his chest X-ray and is suspected to have hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem for HAP, and oseltamavir for influenza. He has a history of cerebrovascular disease, seizure disorder, and chronic hepatitis B.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, which may worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of mortality.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and is at risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease and seizure disorder, and is at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
7. Infection control: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment accordingly.
2. Consider adding additional antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his treatment accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his treatment accordingly.
5. Consider adding additional gastrointestinal prophylaxis to prevent bleeding or perforation.
6. Implement infection control measures to prevent hospital-acquired infections.
7. Consider consulting with infectious disease and cardiology specialists to optimize the patient's treatment."

   Imaging:
   Prior head CT [**2110-12-14**] shows MCA territory infarction of anterior MCA
   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on abx until [**2111-1-28**] developed SOB
   at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR c L lung
   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative x 2.
   Flu negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.
   - Last set of enzymes
   -Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   -f/u Blood cultures
   Respiratory Failure and Ventilation
   Likely as above. Concern for DAH also and edema.
   - Continue vent/tube until after dialysis with fluid removal.
   - Trial [**5-27**] later today
   - Re-eval and spont breathing trial after dialysis at 4 p.m. or so
   - Probably maintain until tomorrow given otherwise late extubation (?)
   Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Blood culture, follow CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow curve
   - Consider u/s of fistula sties (rtight and left)
   Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - F/u blood cultures, repeat
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem per above for HAP coverage
   - Med list from rehab. To see if completed course, or if course
   continued
   ESRD on HD
   HD for this a.m. with goal to be negative.
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Hold coumadin given present INR and possible DAH (consider bridge
   when falls)
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**] if decide on coumadin otherwise lowish goal for
   PTT if concern for DAH
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue fluoxetine
   Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ.
   - Discuss with IR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative x 2.
   Flu negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.

   -f/u Blood cultures
   Respiratory Failure and Ventilation
   Likely as above. Concern for DAH also and edema.
   - Continue vent/tube until after dialysis with fluid removal.
   - Trial [**5-27**] later today
   - Re-eval and spont breathing trial after dialysis at 4 p.m. or so
   - Probably maintain until tomorrow given otherwise late extubation (?)
   Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Blood culture, follow CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow curve

   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Hold coumadin given present INR and possible DAH (consider bridge
   when falls)
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**] if decide on coumadin otherwise lowish goal for
   PTT if concern for DAH
   - Discuss goals of care with family

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of a central line, recent hospitalization, and underlying medical conditions such as chronic HBV.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis and potential multi-organ failure.
4. Dialysis-related complications: The patient is on hemodialysis, which may lead to complications such as dialysis-related hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and stroke.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and cerebral edema.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient has a high risk of developing infection-related complications such as line infections, catheter-related infections, and abscesses.
8. Fluid overload: The patient has a high risk of fluid overload due to the presence of a central line, recent hospitalization, and underlying medical conditions such as chronic HBV.
9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of hypertension-related complications such as stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.
10. Liver dysfunction: The patient has chronic hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver dysfunction and potential liver failure.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and managing the underlying medical conditions to prevent further deterioration."

   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

   GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for hernia
   repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on abx until [**2111-1-28**] developed SOB
   at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR c L lung
   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1
   vaccine, however given tachypnea, would empirically treat with
   oseltamavir, albeit less likely. Differential always includes MI and
   PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from [**12-1**] shows EF
   45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high creatinine with
   clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative.
   -Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Prior head CT [**2110-12-14**] shows MCA territory infarction of anterior MCA
   territory bilaterally, both insular cortices, most of basal ganglia on
   right, sparing of parietal, occipital and medial-most frontal cortex.
   CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2111-2-9**]
   Comparison is made with a prior study from [**2111-1-3**].
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old man with severe shortness of breath after
   hemodialysis, question pneumonia or CHF.
   FINDINGS: Upright portable AP view of the chest is obtained. A dialysis
   catheter is again seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena
   cava.
   Cardiomegaly is noted with diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more
   confluent area of opacity in the left mid and lower lung which raises
   concern
   for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusions or
   pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures appear intact.
   IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema with more
   confluent
   left-sided opacity which may represent superimposed pneumonia.
   Microbiology: Blood culture, MRSA screen, influenza swab all pending.

         GRAM NEGATIVE RODS.
   ECG: 96 sinus, regular. RBBB. Normal intervals. Similar compared to
   prior on [**2110-12-14**].
   Assessment and Plan
   61M ESRD on HD, multiple CVD on coumadin (?c/b seizures), HTN, CAD,
   GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for hernia
   repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on abx until [**2111-1-28**] developed SOB
   at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR c L lung
   infiltrate.
   Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Already received H1N1
   vaccine, however given tachypnea, would empirically treat with
   oseltamavir, albeit less likely. Differential always includes MI and
   PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from [**12-1**] shows EF
   45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high creatinine with
   clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative.
   -Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   -Oseltamavir, Influenza DFA, droplet precautions
   -f/u Blood cultures
   Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - F/u blood cultures, repeat
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem per above for HAP coverage
   - Consult ID in the AM
   - Med list from rehab.
   ESRD on HD
   HD for this a.m. with goal to be negative.
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   - Continue coumadin
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**]
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed respiratory failure, which may lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or respiratory arrest.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left-sided lung infiltrate on chest radiograph, which may be indicative of pneumonia. This could lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, or death.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis, particularly if the infection is not adequately treated.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke.
5. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD on HD, which may lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, or chronic kidney disease progression.
6. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which may lead to further infectious complications such as endocarditis, septicemia, or abscesses.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and cerebrovascular disease, which may lead to further neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or cerebral edema.
8. Hepatic complications: The patient has chronic hepatitis B, which may lead to further complications such as liver failure, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GERD, which may lead to further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
10. Medication-related complications: The patient is taking multiple medications, which may lead to interactions, side effects, or overdose.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presents with respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia and volume overload. He has a history of multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and has been recently treated for ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and volume overload
* End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
* Recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia
* Multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia can worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, and potentially life-threatening complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal failure: End-stage renal disease can lead to further deterioration of kidney function, requiring increased frequency of hemodialysis or potential need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Bacteremia: Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications such as meningitis or endocarditis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of multiple prior CVAs increases his risk of further cardiovascular complications, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's condition can lead to hemodynamic instability, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions such as vasopressors or inotropes.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of prolonged hospitalization and recent antibiotics increases his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing treatment of pneumonia with vancomycin and levofloxacin
* Restarting hemodialysis today
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and potential extubation
* Managing the patient's bacteremia and sepsis
* Monitoring for cardiovascular complications and hemodynamic instability
* Managing the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M ESRD on HD, multiple strokes (on coumadin for prophylaxis),
   HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for
   hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on antibiotics until [**2111-1-28**]
   developed SOB at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR
   with L lung infiltrate.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure/status post Extubation
   Stable to improved. Status post collapse of right lung likely secondary
   to mucous plug and resolving with chest PT. Initial presentation likely
   likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Frothy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative. Flu
   negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   - Obtain PM CXR and AM CXR to assess interval improvement of right
   mucous plug and right lung volume aeration
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Follow up CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow fever curve; pan culture if spikes
   # Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ. Will discuss with IR if spikes.
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   # Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   ESRD on HD
   Plan for HD [**2-12**].
   - Follow renal recommendations
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, BB, ACEi
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Restart Coumadin, INR goal [**2-25**]
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue Zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue Fluoxetine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, soft dysphagia/mechanical diet
   # Prophylaxis: Coumadin
   # Access: PIV x1, R tunneled PICC on right chest into IJ placed on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple strokes, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic hepatitis B, and recent hospitalization for hernia repair and abscess. The patient presented with shortness of breath and was found to have respiratory failure in the emergency department (ED). He was intubated and received antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is extubated and receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His oxygen saturation is 99%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.51, pCO2 of 42 mmHg, and pO2 of 73 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease. His current vital signs show a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/67 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.
* Renal: The patient is on HD and has a creatinine level of 6.6 mg/dL. His urine output is adequate, and his electrolyte levels are within normal range.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics for suspected HAP.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of multiple strokes and is at risk for seizures. He is receiving prophylactic anticonvulsant medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's suspected HAP can progress to a more severe infection, leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's current antibiotics may not be effective against the underlying infection, leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and hypertension can lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
5. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD can lead to further kidney damage, requiring increased dialysis frequency or potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of multiple strokes and cerebrovascular disease can lead to further neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive decline.
7. Line infections: The patient's multiple lines (PICC, arterial, and peripheral) can lead to line infections, which can be difficult to treat and may require removal of the line.
8. Fluid overload: The patient's ESRD and history of hypertension can lead to fluid overload, which can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected HAP.
2. Obtain serial CXRs to monitor the resolution of the right lung infiltrate.
3. Follow up blood cultures to monitor for signs of infection.
4. Continue HD and monitor renal function.
5. Manage the patient's respiratory status with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue prophylactic anticonvulsant medication and monitor for signs of seizure activity.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential complications. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are necessary to manage the patient's condition and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M ESRD on HD, multiple strokes (on coumadin for prophylaxis),
   HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 12717**] for
   hernia repair/abscess/ESBL Klebs bacteremia on antibiotics until [**2111-1-28**]
   developed SOB at HD today. Developed respiratory failure in ED, CXR
   with L lung infiltrate.
   # Dyspnea
   Likely pulmonary edema with superimposed infection: Throthy pink sputum
   and concern for pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Differential
   includes bacteria and viral; CXR shows clear large infiltrate. Recent
   hospitalization so cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Already on
   Vancomycin and Meropenem for prior ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. Would
   add Levofloxacin for better pulmonary coverage. Differential always
   includes MI and PE, though less likely given current CXR. Echo from
   [**12-1**] shows EF 45-50%. HD patient with incomplete dialysis and high
   creatinine with clinical signs of fluid overload. ROMI negative x 2.
   Flu negative by swab and given H1N1 vaccine.
   - Continue to trend enzymes
   - Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Meropenem for HAP (day 1= [**2-9**])
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure and Ventilation
   Likely as above. Concern for DAH also and edema. s/p extubation.
   - Eval CXR
   # Fever
   Possible from PNA, sepsis, fistula site, pelvic abscess, line
   infection,
   - Blood culture, follow CXR
   - Consider line removal (see access below)
   - Follow curve
   - Consider u/s of fistula sites (right and left)
   # Access
   Probably with concern for bilateral fistulae, was PICC power placed as
   tunneled to IJ.
   - Discuss with IR
   - Follow blood cultures and remain sensitive to possible line infection
   (signs attributable to PNA for now)
   Recent Klebsiella ESBL Bacteremia
   Followed by ID on last hospitalization. Vanc and Meropenem were due to
   be completed on [**1-28**]. Unclear if this was stopped at rehab, or if ID
   planned to continue it.
   - F/u blood cultures, repeat
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem per above for HAP coverage
   - Med list from rehab. To see if completed course, or if course
   continued
   ESRD on HD
   HD for this a.m. with goal to be negative.
   - Continue Sevelamer
   - Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   CAD
   ROMI negative.
   - Continue ASA, statin, with caution for DAH
   - Hold BB and ACEI tonight. Consider restarting in the AM if BP
   tolerates.
   Cerebrovascular Disease
   Noted to have vascular dementia and previous likely embolic strokes on
   coumadin
 no documented AF noted on review of past notes. Largest
   changes cerebrovascular/embolic (not hypertensive, but given history of
   hypertension, may also be superimposed and cause of some large vessel
   cerebrovascular disease) with bilateral MCA disease with good
   collateral supply and no watershed. Also ventricular enlargement.
   Equivalent to very posterior lobotomy anatomically.
   - Hold coumadin given present INR and possible DAH (consider bridge
   when falls)
   - Monitor INR: goal [**2-25**] if decide on coumadin otherwise lowish goal for
   PTT if concern for DAH
   - Discuss goals of care with family
   Seizure Disorder/Prophylaxis
   Per note of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 12731**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4021**] [**2110-8-6**], post-stroke seizure with
   two events. On Keppra as an outpatient.
   - Continue Keppra at outpatient doses (but after HD, not before)
   - Continue zonisamide
   Chronic Hepatitis B
   - Monitor liver enzymes
   Depression
   - Continue fluoxetine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Stop subcutaneous heparin given possible DAH and high
   INR
   # Access: PIV x1, R tunneled PICC on right chest into IJ placed on

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with ESRD on HD, multiple strokes, HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, and recent hospitalization for hernia repair and abscess. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema with superimposed infection. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/67 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His neurological examination reveals heavy sedation, but he was able to wake up and interact meaningfully this morning. He has upper motor neuron lesions and moderate muscular atrophy.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.9-8.4 x10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 28.0-31.5%
* Platelet count: 176-177 x10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.8-6.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.07-0.07 ng/mL
* TCO2: 32-37 mmHg
* Glucose: 75-90 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include ESRD on HD, multiple strokes, HTN, CAD, GERD, chronic HBV, and recent hospitalization for hernia repair and abscess. He has a history of ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Pulmonary edema
* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* DAH
* Fluid overload
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Cerebrovascular accident
* Seizure disorder
* Depression

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Monitor enzymes
* Trend CXR
* Consider line removal
* Continue HD
* Monitor liver enzymes
* Continue fluoxetine
* Continue Keppra
* Continue zonisamide
* Monitor INR
* Hold coumadin
* Discuss goals of care with family

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: NPO
* Glycemic control: Monitor glucose levels
* Lines: PICC line, arterial line, and venous line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Code status: Full code
* Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia and volume overload. He has a history of recent prolonged hospitalization for an incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, which was treated with Vancomycin and Meropenem.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure due to L-sided pneumonia, with improved aeration after chest physiotherapy
* End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis
* Recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia, with Vancomycin restarted
* History of multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)
* Restarting Coumadin with an INR goal of 2-25

The patient is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and chest physiotherapy. He is also receiving hemodialysis for ESRD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia worsening or spreading to other areas of the lungs
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Further deterioration of renal function
* Bacteremia or sepsis due to the Klebsiella ESBL infection
* Cerebral edema or bleeding due to the patient's history of multiple CVAs
* Bleeding or thrombosis due to the patient's use of anticoagulation therapy
* Development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to the patient's chronic illness and hospitalization"
