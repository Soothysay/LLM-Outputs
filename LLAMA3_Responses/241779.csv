   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y o male with PMHx significant for COPD and asbestosis, presented on
   [**11-4**] with inability to void, nausea/vomiting. In ED found to be having
   coffee ground emesis, transferred from floor with second episode of
   coffee ground emesis and tachycardia.
   #Abdominal pain/nausea: Concern for possible pancreatitis as patient
   has a history of ERCP on [**2173-4-30**], however never had CCY; currently does
   have gallbladder sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound, but has no elevated Alk
   phos or LFTs.  Patient has mildly elevated lipase. Pain control
   achieved with dilaudid. Concern also for possible incarcerated loop of
   bowel in femoral hernia. Patient was seen by surgery who felt patient
   was not obstructed, most likely has incarcerated fat in femoral area.
   Recommended surgical repair on this hospitalization. Surgery recommends
   not trying to reduce femoral hernia as this will most likely cause more
   pain.  Unclear if this is only source for abdominal pain. Will f/u with
   surgery to see if they feel all pain can be explained by hernia. If
   not, consider possible nephrolithiasis as source of his pain, which
   would make sense given his presentation with dehydration.

   #. Coffee Ground Emesis - he has had two episodes of coffee ground
   emesis yesterday [**11-4**] with remote history of gastric ulcers.  Concern
   for upper GI bleed.  Pt could not tolerate NG lavage.  Guiaic negative.
   No previous colonoscopy.  No h/o liver disease and low suspicion of
   varices.  Has had several episodes of vomiting in past few days; may
   have [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.  Also may have erosive gastritis. Given CXR
   without evidence of free air and unremarkable abdominal exam, suspicion
   of perforated ulcer low. HCT significantly increased overnight, may be
   secondary to hemoconcentration.  However, patient overall appears
   stable in terms of coffee ground emesis, no evidence of acute bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of COPD, asbestosis, and chronic renal failure, admitted to the ICU with an upper GI bleed, coffee ground emesis, and severe abdominal pain. He has a remote history of gastric ulcers and ERCP. The patient has been experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting, and has been treated with pain medication, including dilaudid. A RUQ ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge and a right inguinal mass with a fluid-filled loop of colon. The patient has been diagnosed with an incarcerated loop of bowel in a femoral hernia, and surgery has recommended repair on this hospitalization. The patient's hemoglobin level has increased significantly overnight, and his urine output has improved with fluid bolus. He is being treated for dehydration and is receiving proton pump inhibitors.

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis and hematemesis suggest a possible upper GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and increased risk of further bleeding.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of ERCP and mildly elevated lipase levels suggest a possible pancreatitis, which can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's presentation with dehydration and abdominal pain raises the possibility of nephrolithiasis, which can lead to kidney damage, sepsis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Incarcerated loop of bowel: The patient's diagnosis of an incarcerated loop of bowel in a femoral hernia can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Dehydration: The patient's decreased urine output and increased hemoglobin level suggest dehydration, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Chronic renal failure: The patient's pre-existing chronic renal failure can worsen with dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Hypoxemia: The patient's COPD and asbestosis increase his risk of hypoxemia, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Infection: The patient's history of COPD and asbestosis increase his risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his upper GI bleed, pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, incarcerated loop of bowel, dehydration, chronic renal failure, hypoxemia, and infection. The patient's code status has been changed to full code in the event he requires sedation and intubation for a scope. Further work-up and management of the patient's abdominal pain, including a possible CT scan with IV contrast, is needed to determine the source of his pain. The patient's hemodynamic stability, electrolyte balance, and respiratory status require close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper GI bleed, who presented with inability to void, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of COPD and asbestosis, and was found to have coffee ground emesis in the emergency department. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain and nausea, and has a RUQ ultrasound showing gallbladder sludge and a ringuinal mass with a fluid-filled loop of colon. He has also had two episodes of coffee ground emesis, which may be related to an upper GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He has mild tachycardia, and his laboratory results show mildly elevated lipase and a normal white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis and history of gastric ulcers may indicate an upper GI bleed. The patient's inability to tolerate NG lavage and lack of previous colonoscopy increase the suspicion of a perforated ulcer.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of ERCP and gallbladder sludge may increase the risk of pancreatitis. The patient's mildly elevated lipase levels support this concern.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's RUQ ultrasound shows a ringuinal mass with a fluid-filled loop of colon, which may indicate a small bowel obstruction.
4. Urinary retention: The patient's inability to void and decreased urine output may indicate urinary retention, which could be related to his BPH and failed voiding trial.
5. Dehydration: The patient's decreased urine output and stable creatinine levels may indicate dehydration, which could be related to his gastrointestinal symptoms and fluid loss.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and asbestosis may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may increase his risk of acute kidney injury, particularly if he becomes dehydrated or experiences hypotension.

Based on the patient's medical history and current symptoms, it is essential to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and gastrointestinal symptoms closely to identify any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper GI bleed. He presented with coffee ground emesis, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting. The patient has a history of COPD, asbestosis, chronic renal failure, hypertension, glaucoma, and a remote history of gastric ulcers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a pleasant elderly male with no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. His cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a 6/6 systolic murmur. His lung examination is normal, and his skin examination shows a red, blanching area on the back, sacrum, and thighs consistent with the distribution of weight.

Laboratory results show mildly elevated lipase, gallbladder sludge, and a fluid-filled loop of colon on RUQ ultrasound. His hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, and his platelet count is 243 K/uL.

The patient's diagnosis is likely upper GI bleed, possibly secondary to a gastric ulcer or erosive gastritis. The patient's abdominal pain may be related to an incarcerated loop of bowel in his femoral hernia or possible nephrolithiasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to ongoing bleeding from the upper GI tract.
2. Perforation of the stomach or duodenum, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Pancreatitis, which can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
4. Nephrolithiasis, which can cause flank pain, nausea, and vomiting.
5. Sepsis, which can occur if the patient develops a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
6. Respiratory failure, which can occur if the patient's COPD exacerbates or if he develops pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or congestive heart failure, which can occur if the patient's hypertension is not well-controlled.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, including frequent vital sign checks, laboratory testing, and imaging studies as needed. The patient should also receive aggressive pain management, including dilaudid, and should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His lab results show mildly elevated lipase and a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: Given the patient's history of ERCP and gallstones, there is a risk of pancreatitis. The patient's mildly elevated lipase levels and abdominal pain suggest that this may be a possibility.
2. Obstruction: The RUQ ultrasound shows a fluid-filled loop of colon, which may be obstructed. This could lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
3. Upper GI bleed: The patient's episodes of coffee ground emesis and remote history of gastric ulcers suggest that he may be at risk for further bleeding.
4. Dehydration: The patient's decreased urine output and increased hematocrit suggest that he may be dehydrated. This could lead to further complications such as kidney injury or cardiovascular instability.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asbestosis put him at risk for respiratory failure. His use of home oxygen and albuterol nebs suggests that he may be at risk for further respiratory complications.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's chronic renal failure and hypertension put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Infection: The patient's decreased white blood cell count and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggest that he may be at risk for infection.

Plan:

1. Check lipase levels to see if they are trending up.
2. Consult surgery for evaluation of the R inguinal mass.
3. Continue pain control with dilaudid.
4. Monitor urine output and continue foley until hemodynamically stable.
5. Continue 02 and albuterol nebs for respiratory support.
6. Monitor cardiac status and consider further evaluation for cardiac complications.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and consider further evaluation for infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 66-inch tall, 51.7 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of upper GI bleed. He has a history of ERCP on 4/30/2173, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis on RUQ ultrasound. The patient has severe abdominal pain, which has been managed with morphine and dilaudid. He has also had episodes of coffee ground emesis, which may be related to an upper GI bleed.

The patient's laboratory results show mildly elevated lipase, but no evidence of acute pancreatitis. His WBC count is 12.5, Hct is 32.5, and platelet count is 243. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, but his lipase is mildly elevated.

The patient has a fluid-filled loop of colon on ultrasound, which may be related to a small bowel obstruction. He also has a right inguinal mass with fluid on ultrasound, which may be related to a perforated ulcer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, asbestosis, chronic renal failure, hypertension, glaucoma, and a history of gastric ulcers. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and lorazepam (Ativan).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: Given the patient's history of ERCP and mildly elevated lipase, there is a risk of pancreatitis.
2. Small bowel obstruction: The fluid-filled loop of colon on ultrasound may be related to a small bowel obstruction, which could lead to further complications.
3. Perforated ulcer: The patient's history of gastric ulcers and coffee ground emesis may indicate a risk of perforated ulcer.
4. Urinary retention: The patient's decreased urine output and history of BPH may indicate a risk of urinary retention.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and asbestosis may put him at risk for respiratory failure.
6. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of upper GI bleed and fluid-filled loop of colon, there is a risk of sepsis.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastric ulcers and upper GI bleed may indicate a risk of further bleeding.
8. Dehydration: The patient's decreased urine output and history of vomiting may indicate a risk of dehydration.

The patient's code status has been changed to full code in the event he requires sedation and intubation for a scope."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 51.7 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of upper GI bleed. He has had two episodes of coffee ground emesis and a remote history of gastric ulcers. The patient's pain has been managed with morphine and dilaudid, and he has been receiving pantoprazole infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99%. The patient has a history of COPD, asbestosis, chronic renal failure, HTN, glaucoma, and is at risk for DVT and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis and remote history of gastric ulcers suggest a high risk of upper GI bleed. The patient's bleeding may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and asbestosis increase his risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his oxygen saturation drops below 90%.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure and oliguria/anuria increase his risk of acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic syndrome.
4. DVT and VAP: The patient's risk factors for DVT and VAP, including immobility and invasive lines, increase his risk of developing these complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal infections increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Pain management: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain from the GI bleed require careful management to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment, which can lead to adverse effects.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization increase his risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Infection control: The patient's presence in the ICU increases his risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infections.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 51.7 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an upper GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.6°F, heart rate of 76-108 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52-138/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving pantoprazole infusions to manage the upper GI bleed. Morphine and hydromorphone have been administered for pain control, with the latter providing better relief. Lorazepam was also given for sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 32.5%
* Platelet count: 243
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mg/dL
* Sodium: 141 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.9 mEq/L
* Chloride: 110 mEq/L
* Carbon dioxide: 38.2%
* White blood cell count: 12.5
* Neutrophils: 7.9
* Lymphocytes: 38.2%
* Platelet count: 243

The patient's blood products have been transfused, with a total output of 495 mL. The patient's urine output is 495 mL, and the NG tube has been inserted for gastric decompression.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Given the patient's ongoing upper GI bleed and oliguria/anuria, there is a risk of hypovolemic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition.
3. Infection: The patient's neutrophil count is low, which may increase the risk of infection.
4. Pain management: The patient's pain is not adequately controlled, which may lead to increased discomfort and potentially worsen the patient's condition.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleed may continue to worsen, leading to further complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, which may require further management.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure or impending renal failure.

Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition is necessary to prevent and address these potential complications."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   Primary problems are abd pain and nausea. Dr, [**Name (NI) 1688**] thinks
   femoral hernia is incarcerated - will check with him to see if this is
   sufficient to explain nausea and pain. Lipase is sl elevated but min to
   suggest biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.  GIB seems largely to have
   resolved - hct is stable. Would hold on EGD for now unless bleeding
   increases.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51.7 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of nausea and abdominal pain. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the following:

* The patient has been experiencing moderate pain in the abdomen, which is being managed with medication.
* The patient has been oliguric/anuric, with a total output of 495 mL in 24 hours.
* The patient has a lipase level that is slightly elevated, which may suggest biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.

The patient's physical examination is significant for the following:

* Abdominal tenderness in the mid-epi to lower midline area.
* No signs of jaundice or rash.
* The patient's skin is warm, with erythema on the buttocks.
* The patient's extremities are without cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 243 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38.2 mg/dL
* Sodium: 141 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.9 mEq/L
* Chloride: 110 mEq/L
* Glucose: 160 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 112/36 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and his blood glucose level is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's primary problems are abdominal pain and nausea, and the doctor is considering the possibility of a femoral hernia that is incarcerated as a potential cause of these symptoms. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed has largely resolved, and the doctor is holding off on performing an endoscopy unless bleeding increases.

The patient's plan includes continued pain management, oliguric/anuric management, and monitoring for signs of biliary obstruction or pancreatitis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is transfer to the floor."
