   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   .
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving tot
   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH
   nml on [**10-25**].
   -- f/u  repeat EKG in am
   -- no need for beta-blocker currently as sinus tach, likely
   compensatory
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- cont tube feeds; low threshold for additional maintenance fluids,
   though will not start now
   -- consider pain control with low dose morphine PRN (though likely not
   primary driver of sinus tach)
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt; would consider rescanning for
   tx with thrombolytics if becomes hemodynamically unstable.
   -- consider repeating TSH (though would eb difficult to interpret in
   setting of acute illness)
   .
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   .
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI under GA which cannot be scheduled until
   [**Name (NI) 501**] (pt requires general anesthesia)
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months
   .
   (#) HTN: listed as a prior dx in H&P, thoguh not on home med list; BP
   has been ~150/80 since being in the ICU
   -- on captopril 6.25 TID
   -- might consider changing from ACE I (afterload reduction) to a CCB or
   other given risk of reflex tachycardia
   .
   (#) COAG NEG STAPH BACTERMIA: PICC was pulled yesterday; on vancomcyin
   (1750 mg IV BID); ID followed
   -- cont vanco for two week course; ? whether needs TTE
   -- will check trough before next 4th dose
   -- ID recs
   -- f/u pending cultures
   (#) SEIZURE: dilantin currently at tx levels; albumin normal.  Seizures
   seem to be the genralize tonic clonic type (witnessed during ICU
   stay).  Seizures are frequent movements small twitches or jerking
   movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities.
   -- cont dilantin 200/300
   -- ativan PRN for seizure with concern for injury
   -- seizure precautions
   -- neurology and psych following
   .
   (#) DEMYELINATING DISEASE NOS: being followed by neurology; does not
   have clear diagnosis
   -- neurology wanted repeat MRI under GA (given aggiation); per
   scheduling tech, next available is [**Name (NI) 501**] [**11-13**]
   -- continue solumderol 125 mg QID taper per neuro
   -- FSG QID + SSI PRN while on solumedrol
   .
   (#) ACCESS: ICU team placed left IJ CVL this evening; CXR verified line
   in place
   .
   (#) NUTRITION: restarting tube feeds via NG
   .
   (#) PPX: heparin ggt; protonix; on bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia to 160s and desaturations to mid 80's, likely due to agitation. The patient has a history of b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise and coag neg staph bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tachycardia (127 bpm)
* Tachypnea (29 breaths/min)
* Hypotension (133/73 mmHg)
* Oxygen saturation (97%)
* Temperature (37.7°C)

The patient has a history of seizures, with the most recent one occurring during the ICU stay. The seizure was described as a generalized tonic-clonic type, with frequent movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities. The patient was given 6mg IV ativan and 1mg IV morphine to control agitation and pain.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 9.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct) 31.6%
* Platelet count (Plt) 272 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose 136 mg/dL
* Calcium (Ca++) 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++) 2.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4) 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest: Stranding at puncture site and probably in the anterior mediastinum at the level of the thoracic inlet with perhaps a small amount of blood but no large hematoma. Small pericardial effusion and small right pleural effusion are new.
* CXR: Right IJ catheter with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. NG tube in standard location.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Seizure, with status epilepticus
* Coag-negative staph bacteremia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue treatment of PE with heparin
* Continue to monitor for desaturation
* Repeat MRI under general anesthesia to rule out MS or encephalopathy
* Continue treatment of coag-negative staph bacteremia with vancomycin
* Continue seizure precautions and treatment with dilantin
* Continue to monitor for hypertension and consider changing from ACE inhibitor to a calcium channel blocker
* Continue to monitor for potential complications of demyelinating disease

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further seizures
* Worsening of PE
* Development of pneumonia or other infections
* Hypertension or hypotension
* Demyelinating disease progression
* Coag-negative staph bacteremia progression or complications
* Pulmonary embolism-related complications, such as pulmonary infarction or pulmonary hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   .
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving tot
   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH
   nml on [**10-25**].
   -- f/u  repeat EKG in am
   -- no need for beta-blocker currently as sinus tach, likely
   compensatory
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- cont tube feeds; low threshold for additional maintenance fluids,
   though will not start now
   -- consider pain control with low dose morphine PRN (though likely not
   primary driver of sinus tach)
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt; would consider rescanning for
   tx with thrombolytics if becomes hemodynamically unstable.
   -- consider repeating TSH (though would eb difficult to interpret in
   setting of acute illness)
   .
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   .
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI under GA which cannot be scheduled until
   [**Name (NI) 501**] (pt requires general anesthesia)
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months
   .
   (#) HTN: listed as a prior dx in H&P, thoguh not on home med list; BP
   has been ~150/80 since being in the ICU
   -- on captopril 6.25 TID
   -- might consider changing from ACE I (afterload reduction) to a CCB or
   other given risk of reflex tachycardia
   .
   (#) COAG NEG STAPH BACTERMIA: PICC was pulled yesterday; on vancomcyin
   (1750 mg IV BID); ID followed
   -- cont vanco for two week course; ? whether needs TTE
   -- will check trough before next 4th dose
   -- ID recs
   -- f/u pending cultures
   (#) SEIZURE: dilantin currently at tx levels; albumin normal.  Seizures
   seem to be the genralize tonic clonic type (witnessed during ICU
   stay).  Seizures are frequent movements small twitches or jerking
   movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities.
   -- cont dilantin 200/300

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-neg staph bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia to 160s and desaturations to mid 80's in the setting of likely agitation. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and was seizing upon arrival to the ICU.

The patient's current status is:

* Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia in the 120-130's, likely due to PE's, with no evidence of volume depletion or uncontrolled infection.
* Desaturation: Resolved, with saturations in the mid to upper 90's on room air.
* Mental status: Intermittently seizing, with no clear cause, and possibly a delirium from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process.
* PE's: On heparin gtt, with a need for coumadin 3-6 months.
* Coag-neg staph bacteremia: On vancomycin, with a need for a two-week course.
* Seizure: Dilantin at therapeutic levels, with frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
* Demyelinating disease: Being followed by neurology, with a need for repeat MRI under general anesthesia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued seizure activity: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, leading to increased risk of injury or complications.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE's may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or other complications.
3. Coag-neg staph bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may worsen, leading to sepsis or other complications.
4. Demyelinating disease: The patient's demyelinating disease may worsen, leading to increased risk of neurological complications.
5. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of delirium or other complications.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance may become compromised, leading to dehydration or other complications.
7. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, leading to sepsis or other complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticonvulsant therapy to control seizure activity.
2. Continue treatment of PE's with heparin gtt and coumadin.
3. Continue treatment of coag-neg staph bacteremia with vancomycin.
4. Repeat MRI under general anesthesia to further evaluate the patient's demyelinating disease.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status closely for signs of delirium or other complications.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance closely to prevent dehydration or other complications.
7. Consider changing from ACE I to a CCB or other medication to manage hypertension.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for signs of respiratory failure or other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Likely postictal in setting of
   recurrent seizures, ?psychogenic component as movements do not always
   correspond to EEG activity.  Continue dilantin. Neurology following.
   Follow levels after reloading yesterday. Concerned for ability to
   protect her airway so will remain in the ICU.
 ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:  Neurology following with
   recommendations.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS: As above.

 SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Still concerned about component of anxiety; more
   emotionally labile overnight, crying.  Consider haldol.  Doesn't seem
   clinically dry.  Also has underlying PEs.  Sats stable, doubt recurrent
   PE.  If she becomes more labile or has noted desaturations will
   consider repeat scan to evaluate for recurrent PE.  Add nodal [**Doctor Last Name **].

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Adjusting heparin dosing given elevated PTT.
   Repeat labs this afternoon.
 TRANSIENT DESTURATIONS:  Typically in setting of seizure-like
   activity, albeit doesn't happen with all observed movements.
 LINE INFECTION:  Being treated empirically with vanco albeit cultures
   growing coag negative staph.  Following levels.  Echo without evidence
   of vegetations.  ID following.
OPTIC NEURITIS:  Continues methylprednisolone for empiric treatment of
   optic neuritis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Likely postictal in setting of
   recurrent seizures, ?psychogenic component as movements do not always
   correspond to EEG activity.  Continue dilantin. Neurology following.
   Follow levels after reloading yesterday. Concerned for ability to
   protect her airway so will remain in the ICU.
 ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:  Neurology following with
   recommendations.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS: As above.

 SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Still concerned about component of anxiety; more
   emotionally labile overnight, crying.  Consider haldol.  Doesn't seem
   clinically dry.  Also has underlying PEs.  Sats stable, doubt recurrent
   PE.  If she becomes more labile or has noted desaturations will
   consider repeat scan to evaluate for recurrent PE.  Add nodal [**Doctor Last Name **].

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Adjusting heparin dosing given elevated PTT.
   Repeat labs this afternoon.
 TRANSIENT DESTURATIONS:  Typically in setting of seizure-like
   activity, albeit doesn't happen with all observed movements.
 LINE INFECTION:  Being treated empirically with vanco albeit cultures
   growing coag negative staph.  Following levels.  Echo without evidence
   of vegetations.  ID following.
OPTIC NEURITIS:  Continues methylprednisolone for empiric treatment of
   optic neuritis.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 115.6 kg overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizures. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being unresponsive. The patient has a history of recurrent seizures, atypical multiple sclerosis, and optic neuritis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 152/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen and warm skin. The patient's lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of recurrent seizures, and the possibility of seizure recurrence is high.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient's altered mental status and possible psychogenic component may lead to respiratory compromise, and the patient may require continued respiratory support.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and the possibility of recurrent pulmonary embolism is high, especially given the patient's elevated PTT.
4. Line infection: The patient has a multi-lumen line infection, which may lead to sepsis and other complications.
5. Optic neuritis: The patient has a history of optic neuritis, and the possibility of optic neuritis recurrence is high.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's ICU care includes stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, which may lead to complications such as bleeding or gastrointestinal perforation.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to their immobility and the presence of a central line.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's ICU care includes regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, which may lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
9. Nephrotoxicity: The patient's ICU care includes vancomycin for line infection, which may lead to nephrotoxicity.
10. Psychogenic component: The patient's altered mental status may have a psychogenic component, which may lead to complications such as anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric disorders."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient, an 18-year-old female, has been admitted to the ICU with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She has developed a fever, unknown origin, and has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and coag-negative staph bacteremia. She has also had seizures and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 128 bpm (115-144 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 162/95 mmHg (108-174/118 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 34 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.2-10.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 272-282 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 11 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Chloride: 103 mEq/L
* Bicarbonate: 30.3%
* Glucose: 120-136 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with vancomycin for her bacteremia and has been started on heparin for her PE. She has also been prescribed metoprolol for hypertension and clonazepam for anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of her fever and bacteremia, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Development of further pulmonary emboli, leading to respiratory failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to her coag-negative staph bacteremia and heparin therapy
* Seizure control issues, leading to further neurological damage
* Hypertension, leading to end-organ damage and cardiovascular complications
* Nutritional deficiencies, leading to malnutrition and compromised immune function
* Infection control issues, leading to further infections and complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including a demyelinating disease, who was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations. She has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and seizure disorder. She is currently receiving treatment for her infections, including vancomycin and heparin, and is being monitored for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's coag-negative staph bacteremia and pulmonary embolism put her at risk for developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Complications: The patient's bilateral PEs can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not properly treated.
3. Seizure Disorder Complications: The patient's seizure disorder can lead to injury, brain damage, and death if not properly controlled.
4. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's infections can lead to further complications, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's demyelinating disease and seizure disorder put her at risk for further neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, myelitis, and meningitis.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism and respiratory failure can lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for the patient's infections, including vancomycin and heparin.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis or organ failure.
3. Consider elective intubation for good quality MRI to rule out any further neurological complications.
4. Continue seizure management with dilantin and ativan, and consider adding zyprexa for agitation.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely for signs of cardiac complications.
6. Consider adding a cardioversion to the patient's treatment plan if her tachycardia persists.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely for signs of further neurological complications.
8. Consider adding a neurologist to the patient's treatment team to help manage her demyelinating disease and seizure disorder."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has  sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving to the
   ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when people are present or during
   seizure like activity.  Contributing to tachycardia are bilateral PEs,
   bacteremia, and baseline bacteria.  There is no evidence of volume
   depletion on exam or labs; Anxiety may be contributing; on standing
   clonazepam.  Was bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC.   Pain
   may also be contributing from general immobilization or some other
   process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH nml on [**10-25**].
   -- metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] started for htn, uptitrate to goal BP
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   --low threshold for additional maintenance fluids, though will not
   start now
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI, will discuss with them when
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months

   has been ~150/80 since being in the ICU
   -- on metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **], will uptitrate
   (#) COAG NEG STAPH BACTERMIA: PICC was pulled yesterday; on vancomcyin
   (1750 mg IV BID); ID followed
   -- cont vanco for two week course;  TTE today
   -- will check trough before next 4th dose
   -- ID recs

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, admitted to the ICU for tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid-80's. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), coag-neg staph bacteremia, and seizure activity. The patient is currently on antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anticoagulation therapy. She has altered mental status, encephalopathy, and is experiencing frequent seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has coag-neg staph bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may lead to injury, aspiration, or respiratory compromise.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral PE may lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke.
5. Demyelinating disease: The patient's underlying demyelinating disease may lead to further neurological decline, including paralysis, cognitive impairment, or death.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may lead to delirium, which may worsen her neurological condition.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may lead to further decline in her overall health, including weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing.
8. Bloodstream infection: The patient's bacteremia may lead to a bloodstream infection, which may spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient's desaturations and respiratory compromise may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticonvulsants as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity closely and adjust anticonvulsant therapy as necessary.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary.
5. Consider repeating MRI under general anesthesia to rule out further neurological complications.
6. Provide frequent reassurance and monitoring to prevent delirium.
7. Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
8. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
9. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize the patient's cardiac care.
10. Consider consulting with a neurologist to optimize the patient's neurological care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   agitation, and convulsive activity.   No evidence of volume depletion
   on exam or labs.  Last TSH nml on [**10-25**].
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- continue treatment of bacteremia with vancomycin
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked lasting
   seconds.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- rept MRI scheduled for Wed AM , intubation by anesthesia (pt
   requires general anesthesia), call OR/PACU floor manager/MRI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's. The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient's temperature has been mildly elevated to 100.4°F, and she has been febrile overnight. The source of the fever is unclear.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PE, which is currently being treated with heparin.
3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to hospitalization, pain, or anxiety, on top of her underlying neurologic process.
4. Seizure: The patient is experiencing frequent seizures, which are generalized tonic-clonic in type.
5. Coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC): 12.7 K/uL
2. Elevated platelet count (Plt): 332 K/uL
3. Elevated creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
4. Elevated glucose (Glucose): 121 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue treatment of bacteremia with vancomycin.
2. Continue treatment of PE with heparin.
3. Contain treatment of AMS with clonazepam and frequent reassurance.
4. Continue treatment of seizures with dilantin and ativan PRN.
5. Monitor for further desaturations and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Follow up with neurology and psych for further evaluation and management of AMS and seizures.
7. Continue monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Monitor for signs of bleeding and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fever may progress to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) progression: The patient's PE may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Seizure progression: The patient's seizures may worsen, leading to further neurological compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection progression: The patient's bacteremia may progress to a more severe infection, such as sepsis or meningitis.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue close monitoring and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in the setting of likely agitation and observation peri-intubation for a procedure (MRI). The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is complicated by fever, unknown origin; pulmonary embolism; altered mental status; and seizure activity. She has been experiencing sinus tachycardia, with spikes to 150-160 beats per minute during agitation and convulsive-type activity. Her desaturation has resolved, but she had a brief episode of desaturation to 60's unprovoked.

The patient is being treated for bacteremia with vancomycin and for PE with heparin. She is also being treated for anxiety with clonazepam and for seizures with dilantin. Her MRI is scheduled for Wednesday, and she will require general anesthesia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fever, unknown origin, put her at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's bilateral PE may lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure or death.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient's seizure activity may worsen or lead to status epilepticus, which can be life-threatening.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia may lead to coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Demyelinating Disease: The patient's underlying demyelinating disease may worsen or lead to further complications, such as optic neuritis or transverse myelitis.
6. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and PE may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiomyopathy or heart failure.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's PE and potential respiratory failure may lead to respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently in the ICU for tachycardia, desaturations, and agitation. The patient has been experiencing seizures, and lab results indicate a coag-negative staph bacteremia. The patient's condition is complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) without hemodynamic compromise.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Seizure control: The patient's seizures may continue to be a challenge, and the risk of status epilepticus is high. The patient's dilantin levels may need to be monitored closely, and the dose adjusted accordingly.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's coag-negative staph bacteremia may progress, leading to sepsis, septic shock, or endocarditis.
3. Pulmonary emboli: The patient's bilateral PE may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, hypoxia, or even death.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's underlying demyelinating disease may worsen, leading to further neurological decline, including increased risk of seizures, paralysis, or even death.
5. Delirium: The patient's agitation and anxiety may worsen, leading to delirium, which can further complicate her neurological status.
6. Infection: The patient's PICC line infection may spread, leading to sepsis or endocarditis.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decline, leading to bleeding complications.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
9. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to hypoxia, which can worsen her neurological status.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or even death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations following an MRI procedure. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, and is currently being treated for coag-negative staph bacteremia. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg. She has a white blood cell count of 10.4 K/uL and a platelet count of 318 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is at risk of developing further complications from the coag-negative staph bacteremia, including sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of bilateral PE, and is at risk of developing further emboli or complications from the existing ones.
3. Neurologic Complications: The patient has a history of demyelinating disease and is at risk of developing further neurologic complications, including seizures, stroke, and spinal cord damage.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and is at risk of developing respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure.
6. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, including urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient is at risk of developing nutritional complications, including malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient has a history of anxiety and agitation, and is at risk of developing further psychiatric complications, including delirium, depression, and psychosis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued treatment for her coag-negative staph bacteremia, including vancomycin and heparin. She also requires ongoing management of her pulmonary embolism, including anticoagulation therapy and follow-up imaging. Her neurologic status should be closely monitored, and she should be considered for further imaging and treatment as needed. Her respiratory status should also be closely monitored, and she should be considered for further respiratory support as needed. Her cardiovascular status should be closely monitored, and she should be considered for further cardiovascular support as needed."

   1. No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement or
   abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis plaques.
   2. Left psoas muscles and right posterior paraspinal muscle fluid-fluid
   levels, likely represent intramuscular hematomas with surrounding
   inflammation of the muscles. In presence of signs of infection,
   hemorrhagic abcesses cannot
   be excluded.
   3. New large cystic lesion within the perisplenic region, incompletely
   characterized on this examination. This can represent the stomach,
   however,
   cystic lesion other than this cannot be excluded. CT scan of the
   abdomen is
   recommended.
   4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
   considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Given
   the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is unlikely. Right basilar lower
   lobe
   segmental dependent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
   MRI Head: 1. Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR
   hyperintensity within the
   right cerebral peduncle. Interval decrease in size of the left parietal
   subcortical white matter hyperintensity and stable bilateral forceps
   major,
   splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR
   hyperintensity. This can be seen demyelinating processes such as
   multiple sclerosis or [**Year (4 digits) 9255**].
   2. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells. In the correct clinical
   history,
   this can reflect mastoiditis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 18-year-old female, is a complicated neurologic case with a history of demyelinating disease and multiple sclerosis. She was admitted to the ICU with a fever, altered mental status, and seizure activity. She has been experiencing frequent seizures, which have been treated with Ativan and Dilantin. Her current medications include Vancomycin for coag-neg staph bacteremia, Heparin for pulmonary embolism, Metoprolol for hypertension, and Solumedrol for demyelinating disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 124 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/81 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 96% on room air. Her neurological examination is notable for myoclonic jerks, which were treated with Ativan, and altered mental status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Her MRI head and spine show signs of demyelinating disease, including lesions in the cerebral peduncle and spinal cord. Her blood cultures are negative, and her spinal fluid analysis is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient's coag-neg staph bacteremia may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's frequent seizures may lead to status epilepticus, which can cause respiratory and cardiac arrest.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may lead to respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, or death.
4. Demyelinating disease: The patient's demyelinating disease may lead to further neurological deterioration, including paralysis, blindness, or cognitive impairment.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coag-neg staph bacteremia may lead to coagulopathy, which can cause bleeding or clotting complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's medications, including Vancomycin and Heparin, may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypercalcemia.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal insufficiency, which can lead to further complications, including acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple medications, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage potential complications."

   cystic lesion other than this cannot be excluded. CT scan of the
   abdomen is
   recommended.
   4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
   considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Given
   the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is unlikely. Right basilar lower
   lobe
   segmental dependent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
   MRI Head: 1. Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR
   hyperintensity within the
   right cerebral peduncle. Interval decrease in size of the left parietal
   subcortical white matter hyperintensity and stable bilateral forceps
   major,
   splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR
   hyperintensity. This can be seen demyelinating processes such as
   multiple sclerosis or [**Year (4 digits) 9255**].
   2. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells. In the correct clinical
   history,
   this can reflect mastoiditis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, desaturations, and suspected agitation. The patient has a history of coag-negative staph bacteremia, bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), and seizure activity.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Fever: 101.3°F, with an unknown origin.
2. Tachycardia: 124-140 beats per minute, with a transient response to Metoprolol 5 mg IV push.
3. Respiratory support: The patient was previously intubated and ventilated but was extubated yesterday. She is currently receiving CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 40%.
4. Neurologic status: The patient has intermittent seizure activity, with a recent episode of myoclonic jerks vs. seizure, which was treated with 3 mg of Ativan. A bedside EEG is pending.
5. Imaging: The patient has undergone an MRI head and spine, which showed findings consistent with multiple sclerosis and demyelinating disease. An MRI abdomen is recommended to further evaluate the perisplenic region.
6. Laboratory results: The patient has abnormal laboratory results, including an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. Her blood cultures have been negative to date.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of bilateral PE, which could worsen or recur, potentially leading to respiratory failure.
3. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity could worsen or become more frequent, potentially leading to status epilepticus.
4. Demyelinating disease: The patient's underlying demyelinating disease could lead to further neurological deficits or complications.
5. Coagulation disorders: The patient's history of coag-negative staph bacteremia and bilateral PE may indicate a risk for coagulation disorders, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of coag-negative staph bacteremia and potential gastrointestinal infection could lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as abscesses or perforation.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential underlying cardiac disease could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo with demyelinating disorder and severe progression of loss of
   mental status with hospital course compliacted by PE and GPC
   bacteremia.  She has had persistent worsening of mental status and
   function without clearly defined etiology and with concerning findings
   on MRI scan completed.
   1)Altered Mental Status-This is complicated by underlying disorder
   which remains incompletely defined as well as significant insult from
   recurrent seizure activity.
   -Continue with seizure Rx
   -Avoid sedating medications
   -no evidence of infection
   -MRI completed and we will look to neurology input for guidance as to
   how this study adds to understanding
   -Zyprexa held
   -Do need neurology input to guide path moving forward for family
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   -Dilantin by levels to continue
   3)Pulmonary Emboli
   -Heparin IV to continue
   4)Sepsis
coag negative staph bacteremia
   -Vanco to continue
   -Will check CXR, Urine and blood again
   -The problem is there is concern for possible hemorrhagic abscess in
   psoas
there is concern for infection there and will need to be
   discussed with radiology and pursue next best study.  Concern is raised
   for possible areas of hematoma from previous tap.
   -This will be imaged given findings of persistent fevers at this time
   with resting tachycardia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complex medical condition, including:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive, with no clear etiology for her worsening mental status and function. She has had recurrent seizure activity, which is likely contributing to her mental status.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and Dilantin levels are being monitored to continue treatment.
3. Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has a pulmonary embolism, and Heparin IV is being continued to prevent further clotting.
4. Sepsis: The patient has coag-negative staph bacteremia, and Vancomycin is being continued to treat the infection. There is concern for possible hemorrhagic abscess in the psoas muscle, which will need to be discussed with radiology and pursued with further imaging.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Seizure activity can lead to further mental status deterioration, respiratory compromise, and increased risk of falls and injury.
2. Pulmonary embolism can lead to further respiratory compromise, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute liver failure, and cardiovascular instability.
4. Hemorrhagic abscess in the psoas muscle can lead to further systemic infection, abscess rupture, and potential life-threatening complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her condition in the ICU."
