   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma
   Identified by biopsy. Being treated per plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and
   [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - check LFTs for hepatoxicity
   - monitor for GI sx, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, myalgias in the
   setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - bicarbonate per heme/onc orders
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   .
   # Encephalopathy
   Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual effects of EBV
   meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note suggests more likely
   to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient note suggests
   prominent features are memory impairment and emotional lability. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible aid to
   improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD has been
   a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and would
   hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: However, transplanted kidney has
   marginal function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine
   clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no
   longer an issue.
   - hold CellCept evidently per earlier recs; check in w renal transplant
   re timing of restarting this
   - continue prednisone 4mg daily
   - cont sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6
   - follow up renal recommendations; renal transplant team is following
   and managing CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension
   - continue Atenolol 100 daily
   - continue amlodipine 5mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and kidney transplants, who has recently been diagnosed with EBV-driven CNS lymphoma. She is currently undergoing treatment with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 147/79 mmHg. She is receiving respiratory support with oxygen therapy, and her oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's neurological examination is notable for mild alopecia and nystagmus with gaze in both directions. Her laboratory results show mild elevation of liver enzymes, but her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Her urinalysis shows a pH of 8.5, indicating successful alkalinization of her urine.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's neurological impairment may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis or lymphoma effects. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] suggested methylphenidate as a possible aid to improved cognition, but it has been held off due to agitation while on CVVH/HD.
2. Hypertension: The patient is receiving treatment with Atenolol and amlodipine for her hypertension.
3. Marginal kidney function: The transplanted kidney has marginal function, with an estimated creatinine clearance of 20-25 cc/min/m2.
4. Pancreas-kidney transplant: The patient's pancreas is functioning well, but her kidney has marginal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatoxicity: The patient is receiving high-dose methotrexate, which can cause liver damage.
2. Gastrointestinal symptoms: The patient may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain due to the chemotherapy.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient may develop respiratory distress due to her underlying lung disease or the chemotherapy.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunosuppressed state.
5. Bleeding: The patient may be at risk for bleeding due to her platelet count and the chemotherapy.
6. Renal failure: The patient's marginal kidney function may worsen with continued chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient may develop pancreatitis due to the chemotherapy or the pancreas-kidney transplant.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma
   Identified by biopsy. Being treated per plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and
   [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - bicarbonate per heme/onc orders
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   .
   # Encephalopathy
   Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual effects of EBV
   meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note suggests more likely
   to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient note suggests
   prominent features are memory impairment and emotional lability. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible aid to
   improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD has been
   a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and would
   hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: However, transplanted kidney has
   marginal function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine
   clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no
   longer an issue.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants, and a recent diagnosis of EBV-driven CNS lymphoma. She is currently undergoing treatment for her lymphoma, including IV high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue, and is being managed for related complications such as encephalopathy, hypertension, and marginal kidney function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 147/79 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild alopecia, and her neurological examination is intact, except for some residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis. Her laboratory results show normal electrolyte levels, with a slight elevation in creatinine and a decrease in hemoglobin.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. EBV-driven CNS lymphoma: The patient is undergoing treatment for her lymphoma, including IV high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has some residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, and her neurologic impairment may be related to her lymphoma.
3. Marginal kidney function: The patient's transplanted kidney has marginal function, with an estimated creatinine clearance of 20-25 cc/min/m2.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with medication.
5. Diabetic nephropathy: The patient has a history of type I diabetes and glomerulonephritis, which may contribute to her marginal kidney function.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Lymphoma progression: The patient's lymphoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and potential treatment challenges.
2. Kidney failure: The patient's marginal kidney function may lead to kidney failure, which would require further treatment and management.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may lead to a hypertensive crisis, which would require immediate attention and management.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase her risk of infections, which would require prompt recognition and treatment.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of pancreas-kidney transplant and current treatment may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current treatment plan require close monitoring and management to minimize potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of Type I diabetes, renal transplant, and pancreatic transplant, currently undergoing treatment for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma with methotrexate (MTX). She is in the ICU for maintenance of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) therapy to protect her kidneys. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 146/91 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute and no respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, as well as normal peripheral pulses. The patient's neurologic examination is impaired, with poor word finding and difficulty following simple commands. Laboratory results show mild anemia, normal electrolyte levels, and stable renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and phosphorus, may become imbalanced due to her kidney function and medication use.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is already compromised, and further deterioration may occur due to her underlying disease and treatment.
5. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic status is already impaired, and further deterioration may occur due to her underlying disease and treatment.
6. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving CVVH therapy, which may lead to fluid overload if not properly managed.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal tract may be at risk for bleeding due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be at risk for complications due to her underlying disease and treatment.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent and treat any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma: Identified by biopsy. Being treated per
   plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - monitor for GI sx, elevated LFTs, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain,
   myalgias in the setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - continue cvvh
   - d/c bicarbonate
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   - goal urine pH>7.5
   - check pm methotrexate level, can d/c pt if MTX<0.1
   .
   # Elevated LFT: LFT higher today compared to [**8-14**]. most likely
   secondary to methotrexate. Pt is hepatitis C positive since [**2185**]. [**Last Name (un) **]
   and B neg. Unclear if pt was ever treated for hepC.
   - increase leucovorin dose per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**]
   - continue to monitor
   - will need to get hep C viral load checked as outpatient
   - If continues to rise, RUQ US to rule out cholecystitis or liver
   pathology
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual
   effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note
   suggests more likely to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient
   note suggests prominent features are memory impairment and emotional
   lability. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible
   aid to improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD
   has been a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and
   would hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   - continue to monitor mental status regularly
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: transplanted kidney has marginal
   function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine clearance
   has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no longer an
   issue.
   - hold MMF if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue prednisone 4mg daily
   - d/c sodium bicarb 1300 PO Q6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - renal recs: cont CVVH, check MTX level at 3am. If <0.1, can stop
   CVVH. check CBC lytes and VBG. replete phos with K phos 30mM. hold MMF
   if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]. No bicarb
   necessary as pt is on CVVH
   - onc recs: if MTX <0.1, can stop CVVH. wondering if pt can be
   electively admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] next time for CVVH. pt can be d/c'd home
   directly from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] when not requiring CVVH
   - renal and onc had conflicting recs: renal wants to stop CVVH when MTX
   level <1, onc wants <0.1. Renal is thinking about long-session HD for
   next time but onc wants elective [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] admission next time. renal wanted
   to run even I/O, but onc wants to run negative.
   - cvvh continued as MTX level was 2.61
   - urine ph has been above 7.5
   - pt was teary eyed and anxious all night, relieved somewhat by ativan
   and chocolate, and comfort by nurse all night

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant. She has been diagnosed with EBV-driven CNS lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatment with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue.

The patient is experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Elevated liver enzymes (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are higher today compared to 8/14, likely secondary to methotrexate. She is also hepatitis C positive.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has neurologic impairment, which may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis or lymphoma effects.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently taking atenolol and amlodipine.
4. Anxiety: The patient has been experiencing anxiety and is being treated with ativan as needed.
5. Renal issues: The patient has marginal function of her transplanted kidney, with an estimated creatinine clearance of 20-25 cc/min/m2.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continuing high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue.
2. Monitoring for GI symptoms, elevated LFTs, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, and myalgias.
3. Continuing CVVH and leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders.
4. Monitoring urine pH and adjusting treatment as necessary.
5. Checking methotrexate levels and discontinuing treatment if the level is <0.1.
6. Increasing leucovorin dose if necessary.
7. Monitoring glucose levels and adjusting treatment as necessary.
8. Continuing prednisone 4mg daily.
9. Holding MMF if WBC <3.0, otherwise restarting MMF at 500mg on discharge.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Methotrexate toxicity: High-dose methotrexate can cause toxicity, including GI symptoms, elevated LFTs, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, and myalgias.
2. Lymphoma progression: The patient's lymphoma may progress despite treatment, leading to worsening neurologic impairment and other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's marginal function of her transplanted kidney may worsen, leading to renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her chronic kidney disease and lymphoma treatment.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen due to her lymphoma treatment.
7. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen due to her lymphoma treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical complications to prevent worsening of her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch, 55 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of lymphoma. They have been receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal dysfunction. The patient's MTX level was 2.61, which is above the desired level of 0.1. The renal team recommends continuing CVVH and checking MTX levels at 3 am. The oncology team, on the other hand, recommends stopping CVVH if the MTX level is below 0.1 and considering elective admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for CVVH.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 160/82 mmHg. They have a history of allergic reactions to ampicillin, penicillins, and morphine.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.2 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hct: 23.9% (normal range: 37-48%)
* Plt: 478 (normal range: 150-450)
* Cr: 1.0 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)
* Other lab results include elevated ALT, AST, and LDH levels, as well as low albumin and calcium levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain areas, such as their peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems.

Potential medical complications:

* Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney damage. Continued CVVH may be necessary to manage this condition.
* Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat this condition.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Transfusions may be necessary to manage this condition.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium and phosphorus levels are low, which may require repletion therapy.
* Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is low, which may indicate malnutrition. Nutritional support may be necessary to manage this condition.
* Cancer progression: The patient's lymphoma may be progressing, which may require changes to their treatment plan."

   The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with history of type I diabetes
   since age 14 months, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants in [**2174**] and
   [**2177**], and a double kidney and pancreas transplant on [**2188-11-20**], who has
   newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma.
   # EBV-Derived CNS Lymphoma: Identified by biopsy. Being treated per
   plan by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4292**].
   - IV high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin rescue started on the onc
   floor; we are now alkalinizing urine and initiating CVVH after HD was
   done on the floor
   - check LFTs for hepatoxicity
   - monitor for GI sx, HA, N/V/D, SOB, joint pain, myalgias in the
   setting of high-dose MTX
   - continue leucovorin rescue per heme/onc orders
   - bicarbonate per heme/onc orders
   - antiemetics, supportive care
   .
   # Elevated LFT: LFT higher today compared to [**8-14**]. most likely
   secondary to methotrexate. Pt is hepatitis C positive since [**2185**]. [**Last Name (un) **]

   - continue to monitor
   - If continues to rise, RUQ US to rule out cholecystitis or liver
   pathology
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Some of her neurologic impairment may be residual
   effects of EBV meningoencephalitis, but [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] outpatient note
   suggests more likely to be lymphoma effects. Dr.[**Name (NI) 10281**] outpatient
   note suggests prominent features are memory impairment and emotional
   lability. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2351**] initial note suggested methylphenidate as a possible
   aid to improved cognition; at this point, agitation while on CVVH/HD
   has been a bigger issue than slowing per report of the floor team, and
   would hold off on a stimulant until this phase is completed.
   .
   # s/p Pancreas-kidney transplant: However, transplanted kidney has
   marginal function but she is still making urine. Estimated creatinine
   clearance has been 20-25 cc/min/m2. Pancreas working fine; diabetes no
   longer an issue.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - renal and onc had conflicting recs: renal wants to stop CVVH when MTX
   level <1, onc wants <0.1. Renal is thinking about long-session HD for
   next time but onc wants elective [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] admission next time. renal wanted
   to run even I/O, but onc wants to run negative.
   - renal recs: cont CVVH, check MTX level at 3am. If <0.1, can stop
   CVVH. check CBC lytes and VBG. replete phos with K phos 30mM. hold MMF
   if WBC <3.0, otherwise on discharge restart MMF at 500mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - onc recs: if MTX <0.1, can stop CVVH. wondering if pt can be
   electively admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] next time for CVVH. pt can be d/c'd home
   directly from [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] when not requiring CVVH
   - cvvh continued as MTX level was 2.61
   - urine ph has been above 7.5
   - pt was teary eyed and anxious all night, relieved somewhat by ativan
   and chocolate.

Summary:

The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, glomerulonephritis, kidney transplants, and a double kidney and pancreas transplant. She has newly diagnosed EBV-driven CNS lymphoma and is being treated with IV high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 160/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving CVVH and has been alkalizing her urine.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) likely secondary to methotrexate
* Encephalopathy, which may be residual effects of EBV meningoencephalitis or lymphoma effects
* Hypertension, which is being managed with medication
* Anxiety, which is being treated with ativan and a scheduled consult with a social worker
* Marginal function of her transplanted kidney, with an estimated creatinine clearance of 20-25 cc/min/m2

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Hepatotoxicity due to methotrexate, which may require further management and monitoring
* Gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, joint pain, and myalgias due to high-dose methotrexate, which may require further management and monitoring
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count of 478 K/uL
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and presence of central nervous system lymphoma
* Potential for further decline in renal function, which may require further management and monitoring
* Potential for further decline in liver function, which may require further management and monitoring"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 39-year-old female with IDDM, who has undergone renal and pancreas transplantation. She has recently been diagnosed with EBV-associated CNS lymphoma and is being treated with MTX. She is currently receiving CVVH therapy in the ICU for renal protection. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/97 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress or signs of infection. Her laboratory results show elevated LFTs, with an ALT of 108 mg/dL and AST of 101 mg/dL. Her MTX level is 0.15, which is higher than the desired goal of <0.1.

The patient's plan includes continued CVVH therapy, additional leukovorin due to elevated LFTs, and repeat MTX level this afternoon to assess clearance. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Severe neurological complications due to the CNS lymphoma, such as seizures, brain edema, or cranial nerve palsies.
2. Infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections, which can be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state.
3. Renal dysfunction or failure, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of CVVH-related complications.
4. Bleeding or hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying medical conditions.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal care."
