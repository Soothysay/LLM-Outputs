   Imaging: Very limited examination without IV contrast (due to the
   patient's renal insufficiency), with:
   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically
   suggest
   the vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess complex.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.
   OSH Records:
   RP Ultrasound [**2146-8-1**]: left renal cyst, no hydro
   CT [**2146-8-3**]: PO no IV contrast: sigmoid diverticula without
   diverticulitis, large left inguinal hernia with mesenteric and smll
   knuckle of nondistended distal colon.
   Echo [**2146-8-3**]: EF 60%, mild AR, now AS. Mild tr. No vegetation..
   [**2146-8-4**]: LENIs negative for DVT
   SPEP pending
   Negative lyme, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], hepatitis, neg lipase.
   Creatine had been 2.5. Basleline 1.5-2, up to 3. has been having
   prostatic symptoms, underwent prostatic bx [**2143**].
   TURP [**2-20**]. h/o gout, asthma
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema:
   Combination of demand ischemia in setting of hypertension, possible
   component of aortic stenosis.
   - Largely improved; will largely run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - consider tagged WBC scan since gadolinium is not ideal.
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone.
   # NSTEMI
   - likely demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/tachycardia, less
   likely distal LAD. No associated ECG changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above.
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF, primary team to
   confirm home regimen in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. L4-5: Multifactorial right neural foraminal and subarticular zone
   stenosis with likely impingement upon the right exiting L4 and
   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5
   nerve
   root.
   3. No specific finding on the STIR sequence, evidence of endplate or
   disc
   destruction or epidural or paraspinal fluid collection to specifically
   suggest
   the vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess complex.

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema:
   Combination of demand ischemia in setting of hypertension, possible
   component of aortic stenosis.
   - Largely improved; will largely run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - consider tagged WBC scan since gadolinium is not ideal.
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone.
   # NSTEMI
   - likely demand ischemia in setting of hypertension/tachycardia, less
   likely distal LAD. No associated ECG changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above.
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF, primary team to
   confirm home regimen in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   traversing L5
   nerve roots with moderate overall canal stenosis at this level.
   2. L5-S1: Combination of congenitally abnormal canal geometry with
   prominent
   epidural lipomatosis, as well as facet arthrosis, results in severe
   relative
   canal stenosis with compression of the thecal sac; there is also left
   neural
   foraminal stenosis with likely impingement upon the exiting left L5

   ECG: ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Suboptimal image image qaulity
   prohibits adequate visualization of the distal LV/apex - however the
   apex (apical lateral) appears hypokinetic in some views. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Possible apical hypokinesis. If
   clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may assist in
   better defining regional LV systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Improved with nitro and lasix, on 4L
   - Largely improved; will run even
   - NTG gtt, wean off today
   -started on beta blocker today
   #. Fevers:
   Cultures yesterday and at the outside hospital are growing gram
   positive cocci in pairs and chains, possibly a strep species. Overall
   picture is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary
   discitis/abscess that has not been identified.
   - TEE today to look for valvular vegatations
   - f/u speciation
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone; f/u vanc level
   -if negative consider tagged wbc scan
   # NSTEMI- likely demand ischemia in setting of
   hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes
   Enzymes now trending down
   - daily asa
   - continue heparin for 24h, discontinuing this afternoon
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - start high dose statin
   #. Lower back pain: In the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute
   onset lower back pain, we remain suspicious of an epidural abscess or
   discitis.
   - w/u as above
   -morphine for pain
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary to volume
   depletion and pain. Improved with fluids and pain control.
   -Continue morphine prn pain
   #. Renal failure: Was being worked up at OSH for
   paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike.
   - repeat SPEP
   - baseline is now likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new
   baseline.
   -renally dose meds
   .
   #. EKG changes: Patient with lateral ST depressions in V4-V6 with no
   baseline to compare to. Likely represnts demand ischemia in the setting
   of tachycardia. Will check as set of cardiac enzymes, and repeat EKG
   when tachycardia under better control.
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   -Will add on iron studies
   -Guiac stools
   - active T&S
   -Obtain records for baseline
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF,

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU with respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of hypertension, tachycardia, and recent hospitalization for asthma.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has improved respiratory distress with nitro and lasix, and is currently on 4L oxygen.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a suspected NSTEMI, likely due to demand ischemia, and is being treated with heparin, beta blockers, and statins.
* Infectious: The patient has fevers, leukocytosis, and acute onset lower back pain, which is concerning for a strep endovascular infection or primary discitis/abscess.
* Neurological: The patient has a possible apical hypokinesis on echocardiogram, which may be related to the suspected NSTEMI.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, which is being managed with fluid restriction and renally adjusted medications.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gout and is being treated with colchicine.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is being investigated with iron studies and stool samples.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's suspected NSTEMI could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Infectious complications: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis could indicate a more severe infection, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gout and colchicine use could lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued management of respiratory distress with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
* Continued treatment of suspected NSTEMI with heparin, beta blockers, and statins.
* Investigation of infectious causes with blood cultures, urinalysis, and imaging studies.
* Management of acute renal failure with fluid restriction and renally adjusted medications.
* Monitoring for gastrointestinal complications with stool samples and imaging studies.
* Monitoring for hematological complications with iron studies and stool samples."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition. The patient's temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C) with a history of fever since admission. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and ampicillin/sulbactam, and has been started on unasyn pending speciation. The patient's blood cultures have grown enterococci, and sensitivities are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/67 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's neurological examination is limited due to the patient's altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of kidney dysfunction, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest kidney injury, which can worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed with appropriate ventilation and oxygenation.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and limited neurological examination suggest the possibility of neurological complications, which can worsen if not addressed promptly.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, which can lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics pending speciation of blood cultures.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Manage the patient's kidney dysfunction with dialysis or other renal replacement therapy as necessary.
4. Manage the patient's hypertension with medication and other therapies as necessary.
5. Provide supportive care for the patient's respiratory status, including ventilation and oxygenation as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Manage the patient's fluid balance closely to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider cardiology consultation to optimize the patient's cardiac care."

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a critically ill gentleman with a complex medical condition. The patient has been diagnosed with a gram-positive cocci infection, likely Enterococcus species, based on blood cultures. The patient's fever has persisted, and the ID team has recommended stopping Vanc and Ceftriaxone and starting Unasyn pending speciation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/67 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and the ABG results indicate a pH of 7.23.

The patient's physical examination reveals a large amount of TTP over the low spine process, paraspinal tenderness, and a possible infection. The patient's neuro exam is normal, and there are no signs of rash or other skin lesions.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* WBC count: 13.9-17.6 K/uL
* Hct: 31.1-27.5%
* Plt: 314-343 K/uL
* Cr: 2.2-2.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.36-0.32 ng/mL
* Glucose: 145-117 mg/dL

The patient has undergone several blood cultures, and the preliminary results indicate a gram-positive cocci infection. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a Troponin-T level of 0.36 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the gram-positive cocci infection
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, given the patient's elevated cardiac enzymes
* Renal failure, given the patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of renal failure
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's elevated respiratory rate and ABG results
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or meningitis, given the patient's fever and positive blood cultures.

The patient's plan of care includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor once stabilized."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - WBC scan in lieu of MRI L spine (to be started today and completed
   tomorrow)
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. He has a history of aortic valve endocarditis, which was confirmed by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient has been treated with Unasyn and will likely require a 6-week course of antibiotics. He also has a suspected epidural abscess or discitis, which is being evaluated with a WBC scan. The patient has acute pulmonary edema, which has improved with treatment, and elevated troponins, which are likely due to demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's aortic valve endocarditis is a high-risk infection that requires prolonged antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for complications such as valve damage, embolization, or sepsis.
2. Epidural Abscess or Discitis: The patient's symptoms of low back pain, fever, and leukocytosis suggest a possible epidural abscess or discitis, which can lead to neurological complications, such as spinal cord compression or meningitis, if left untreated.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure is a concern, and his recent deterioration may be related to his underlying condition or the antibiotics he is receiving. Close monitoring of his renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly and effectively. Close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation is essential to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponins suggest possible cardiac complications, such as demand ischemia or infarction. Close monitoring of his cardiac function is essential to prevent further cardiac damage.
6. Infection: The patient's infection can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly and effectively. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.
7. Gout: The patient's history of gout may be exacerbated by his current condition, and close monitoring of his uric acid levels and treatment of his gout is essential to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   aortic valve endocarditis.
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE yesterday. Presumably from
   his recent TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue unasyn for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures
   # Low back pain: In setting of fevers, leukocytosis, and acute lower
   back pain, still highly suspicious of epidural abscess or discitis.
   However, given renal failure, unable to get MRI L-spine.
   - appreciate neurosurgery following/
   - WBC scan pending
   - MRI L Spine with gadolinium today despite renal risk given changing
   neuro exam.
   - Dilaudid prn for pain meds
   - q2h neurochecks
   # Acute Pulmonary Edema: Off nitro gtt since yesterday, on 2 L NC, much
   improved
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - hold on plavix given possible surgery
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue dilaudid prn
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - repeat SPEP, UPEP
   - renally dose meds
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress. He was transferred from the operating room after a TURP procedure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, paraproteinemia/myeloma, and possible myeloma with a m-spike. He is currently being treated for aortic valve endocarditis, which was diagnosed via transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient has also been diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema, which has improved with treatment.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.8°F (38.8°C)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 150/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 314 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.36 ng/mL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL

   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2146-9-20**].
   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.

   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA with encouragement
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF
   # constipation: add bowel regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of aortic valve endocarditis, likely secondary to a recent TURP procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypertension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure of 144/54 mmHg and a heart rate of 88 bpm.
* Neurological status: The patient has decreased strength in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion in the left and right legs, respectively, and has a decreased sensation in the left leg.
* Renal function: The patient has chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.5-2.5 mg/dL.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL.
* Infectious diseases: The patient has enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis, with multiple small epidural abscesses.

The patient's medications include:

* Ampicillin
* Ceftriaxone
* Heparin
* Famotidine
* Diazepam
* Neurontin
* Dilaudid PCA

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Blood cultures: Positive for Enterococcus species
* Gram stain: Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains
* WBC count: 13.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 141 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.36 ng/mL

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Infection and Antibiotics:**

* The patient has a positive blood culture for Enterococcus faecalis, which is sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and levoquinol.
* The patient is receiving ceftriaxone IV q24h for synergistic effect if faecalis is the causative organism.
* The patient has also had positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, which is consistent with Enterococcus species.

**Neurological Complications:**

* The patient has multiple small abscesses at the level of L5, which may indicate discitis L5/S1.
* The patient has T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the level of L5/S1 and L1/L2, which may suggest degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without evidence of abscess.

**Cardiovascular Complications:**

* The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is at risk for cardiac complications.
* The patient's blood pressure has been hypertensive, and they have received labetalol to control blood pressure.

**Respiratory Complications:**

* The patient has a positive sputum culture for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which may indicate a progressing airway infection/inflammation.
* The patient has a portable AP chest radiograph showing right upper lobe perihilar opacity with bronchial wall thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations.

**Other Complications:**

* The patient has a history of DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF heparin.
* The patient has a high risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

**Plan:**

* Continue ICU care with close monitoring of the patient's condition.
* Continue antibiotics as prescribed.
* Consider surgical debridement of the abscesses at L5, but this should be discussed with the neurosurgeons.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis if the patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further complications, including cardiac, neurological, and respiratory complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2146-9-20**].
   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   There is still present right upper lobe perihilar opacity with
   bronchial wall
   thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations. There is also
   interval
   development of left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar
   opacities might represent similar process. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is stable, and the lungs are essentially clear. The above described
   findings
   are consistent with progressing airway infection/inflammation. No newly
   developed focal consolidation is demonstrated. The previously described
   mild
   pulmonary edema is still present, unchanged.
   MRI L-SPINE FINDINGS:
   There are multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly
   posterior epidural space bilaterally extending from the L5 epidural
   space to
   the level of S1. The largest one measures 8.8 x 4.6 mm. The one on the
   left
   measures approximately 5.2 x 3 mm. Multiple loculations are seen which
   cause
   severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1. Given that
   post-
   contrast images were not obtained, it is difficult to determine the
   enhancement pattern of these.
   There is T2 hyperintensity within the intervertebral disc space at the
   level
   of L5/S1 and L1/L2 without evidence for enhancement which may suggest
   degenerative changes or alternatively inflammatory changes without
   evidence
   for abscess.
   Stable degenerative changes as detailed previously are also seen, the
   most
   prominent of these located at the level of L4/L5 with associated grade
   1
   anterolisthesis causing severe spinal canal narrowing and bilateral
   subarticular narrowing with likely close abutment of the descending
   bilateral,
   right greater than left, L5 nerve root. The examination continues
   unchanged
   when compared to the prior exam.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly posterior epidural loculated enhancing fluid
   collections,
   the largest on the right measuring 8.8 x 4.6 mm and on the left 5 x 3
   mm,
   causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
   2. T2 hyperintensity within the L5/S1 and L1/L2 intervertebral disc
   spaces
   may reflect degenerative changes or early inflammatory changes without
   any
   evidence for enhancement to suggest discrete abscess. No evidence for
   osteomyelitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o.M with fever, low back pain, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, now found to have
   enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural
   abscesses.
   # Epidural Abscesses: Found on MRI L spine yesterday. Meeting yesterday
   with Neurosurgery and family determined that surgery would not be
   pursued at this time given small size of abscesses, cardiac risk given
   recent demand ischemia.
   - monitor neuro checks q4 hours
   - continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and
   ceftriaxone per ID
   - appreciate neurosurgery recs
   - f/u all cultures and sensitivities
   - WBC scan (2^nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
   - Pain control with neurontin, valium, Dilaudid PCA
   # Aortic Valve Endocarditis: Found on TEE. Presumably from his recent
   TURP in [**2145**].
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue ampicillin and ceftriaxone for likely 6 weeks
   - will need PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
   # Elevated troponins: Per cardiology, likely demand ischemia in setting
   of hypertension/tachycardia, less likely distal LAD. No associated ECG
   changes. Enzymes peaked and trended down, s/p 24 hours of heparin
   - daily aspirin
   - high dose statin, beta blocker
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, most likely secondary pain.
   - continue pain control
   - monitor on telemetry
   #. Renal failure: Likely chronic renal failure. Was being worked up at
   OSH for paraproteinemia/myeloma with possible m spike. Baseline is now
   likely 1.5-2.5, and he appears to be within new baseline.
   - SPEP/UPEP pending
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor Cr closely given recent contrast load
   #. Anemia: No baseline to compare to. Normal MCV suggests this may be
   related to underlying inflammation from current process.
   - Guiaic stools
   - active T&S
   #. Gout: Will hold medications for now given ARF

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, low back pain, and respiratory distress, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis with multiple small epidural abscesses.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (82-104 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 144/54 mmHg (77/103 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (13-27 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has been treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone for enterococcal infection, and the antibiotic regimen will be continued for likely 6 weeks. The patient's pain control is being managed with neurontin, valium, and Dilaudid PCA.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.9 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 401 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.36 ng/mL (normal range: <0.04 ng/mL)

The patient's radiology results show:

* MRI L-spine: multiple loculated fluid collections within the predominantly posterior epidural space, causing severe spinal canal narrowing extending from L5 through S1.
* Portable AP chest radiograph: right upper lobe perihilar opacity with bronchial wall thickening and minimal peribronchial consolidations, and left perihilar bronchial wall thickening and perihilar opacities.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis
* Multiple small epidural abscesses
* Renal failure
* Anemia
* Tachycardia
* Gout

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to treat enterococcal infection with ampicillin and ceftriaxone
* Monitor neuro checks every 4 hours
* Continue pain control with neurontin, valium, and Dilaudid PCA
* Follow-up cultures and sensitivities
* WBC scan (2nd day) to assess for further areas of infection
* Daily surveillance cultures until 48 hours of negative cultures
* PICC after 48 hours of negative cultures

Overall, the patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, organ failure, and cardiac events. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."
