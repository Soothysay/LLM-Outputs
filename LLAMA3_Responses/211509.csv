Summary:

The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU with unclear medication availability. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 132/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with the exception of absent radial and digital pulses on the right and left sides. The patient is oriented to person, place, and time, and is able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's unclear medication availability and potential for inadequate antibiotic coverage increases the risk of infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's absent radial and digital pulses on the right and left sides may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization and obesity increase their risk of developing VTE, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory distress.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's glycemic control and nutrition plan are not clearly stated, which may increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea or constipation.
6. Skin Breakdown: The patient's obesity and lack of mobility increase their risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.

Recommendations:

1. Ensure adequate antibiotic coverage and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Perform regular neurovascular checks to monitor for signs of sepsis or VTE.
3. Implement VTE prophylaxis measures, such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting their oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Ensure the patient's glycemic control and nutrition plan are clearly stated and implemented.
6. Perform regular skin assessments to monitor for signs of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He has had an anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept in the past and is currently undergoing elective administration of abatacept.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1Â°F, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 132/72 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. He is receiving infusions of abatacept and prednisone, and is being closely monitored for any signs of anaphylaxis.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, and he is oriented to person, place, and time. His neurological examination is normal, except for absent radial and dorsal pedal pulses on both sides.

The patient's laboratory results show a normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and liver function tests. His blood glucose level is 140 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1c level is 7.5%.

The patient's medical plan includes the administration of abatacept, prednisone, and other medications to manage his conditions. He is being closely monitored for any signs of anaphylaxis or other complications, and his code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, and is at risk of having a severe allergic reaction during or after the infusion.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunosuppressed state and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of IBD and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if he is taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other medications that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially if he is intubated or has a compromised respiratory status.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, especially if he has a history of cardiovascular disease or is taking medications that can cause cardiovascular side effects.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, especially if he has a history of neurological disease or is taking medications that can cause neurological side effects.
7. Kidney complications: The patient is at risk of developing kidney complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, especially if he has a history of kidney disease or is taking medications that can cause kidney damage."

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He has a prior anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept and is currently awaiting the availability of the necessary amount to administer it. He is receiving steroids and abatacept, and his medications have been adjusted accordingly. He is currently on a diabetic diet and is NPO after midnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 132/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for the absence of radial and digital pulses on the right side and the presence of a rash on the left side.

The patient's laboratory results are pending, but an image of his chest X-ray is attached. He has a code status of ""full code"" and is pending disposition.

Potential medical complications:

1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's prior anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, there is a risk of anaphylaxis with future administrations.
2. Infection: The patient's IBD is currently inactive, but there is a risk of infection due to the immunosuppressive effects of abatacept.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's DM2 is being managed with insulin sliding scale (ISS), but there is a risk of hypoglycemia due to the absence of oral hypoglycemics.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with antihypertensives, but there is a risk of hypertension due to the potential for anaphylaxis.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to his immobility and the presence of central venous lines.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and the presence of central venous lines.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his mechanical ventilation and the presence of central venous lines."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His right hand continues to swell. There is no swelling elsewhere
   including oropharynx and airway. He denies respiratory symptoms and his
   lungs are clear. He will be continued on prednisone, benadryl, H2
   blocker, singulair. He will be observed overnight in the hospital.

Summary:

The patient, a 37-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis, IBD, HTN, DM2, and a prior anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, was admitted to the ICU for monitored abatacept administration. He received abatacept yesterday at 3 pm and initially experienced mild allergic reaction-type symptoms, including hand swelling, which resolved with IV benadryl. Overnight, he reported chest tightness, feeling like a rubber band around his jaw, and mild dyspnea, which resolved with atrovent neb treatment. This morning, he had no symptoms, and his arms and hands felt normal.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is being monitored for 24 hours after the initial infusion, and his medication plan includes continuing higher dose prednisone, famotidine, and benadryl for 24 hours post-infusion. The attending physician is considering whether the patient can be discharged home this afternoon or if he needs to stay for further monitoring due to the hand swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept and experienced mild allergic reaction-type symptoms, including hand swelling, after receiving the medication. He will be monitored for 24 hours after the initial infusion, and his medication plan includes continuing higher dose prednisone, famotidine, and benadryl to minimize the risk of anaphylaxis.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient reported chest tightness, feeling like a rubber band around his jaw, and mild dyspnea overnight, which resolved with atrovent neb treatment. He will be closely monitored for any respiratory symptoms and will receive oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has HTN and DM2, which increase his risk of cardiovascular complications. He will be closely monitored for any signs of cardiovascular distress, and his blood pressure will be controlled as needed.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has IBD and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications. He will be closely monitored for any signs of gastrointestinal distress, and his medication plan will be adjusted as needed.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunosuppressive therapy and underlying medical conditions. He will be closely monitored for any signs of infection, and his antibiotic therapy will be adjusted as needed."

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He has had a prior anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept and was admitted for elective infusion of the medication. Yesterday, he received the initial dose of abatacept at 3 pm and experienced mild allergic symptoms, including hand swelling, chest tightness, and dyspnea, which were managed with IV benadryl and atrovent neb treatment. Today, he has no symptoms, and his arms and hands are back to normal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use.

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management, including psoriatic arthritis, IBD, HTN, and DM2. He is receiving steroids and abatacept for his psoriatic arthritis, and his IBD is currently inactive. His DM2 is being managed with insulin sliding scale (ISS).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's history of anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, he is at risk for another severe allergic reaction. Close monitoring for 24 hours after the initial infusion is necessary.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's DM2 requires careful management, and the hold on PO hypoglycemics may lead to hypoglycemic episodes. ISS should be started to prevent hypoglycemia.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent fluid overload, particularly with the use of IV fluids.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild dyspnea and chest tightness may be indicative of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Infection: The patient's IBD and DM2 increase his risk for infection, particularly with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's HTN and DM2 increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring for 24 hours after the initial infusion to detect any signs of anaphylaxis.
2. Start ISS to manage the patient's DM2 and prevent hypoglycemic episodes.
3. Continue famotidine and benadryl for 24 hours post-infusion to manage allergic symptoms.
4. Discuss with the attending physician whether the patient can be discharged home this afternoon or if further monitoring is necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely to detect any signs of respiratory complications.
6. Consider obtaining a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other respiratory complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission who received abatacept infusion at 3 pm, followed by initial reactions including hand swelling, chest tightness, and mild dyspnea. Symptoms resolved with IV benadryl and atrovent neb treatment. The patient has a history of allergy to Keflex, and previous antibiotics were discontinued. Current vital signs include a temperature of 37Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including famotidine, and has undergone hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Physical examination was not assessed due to the patient's unstable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's history of allergy to Keflex and initial reactions to abatacept, there is a risk of anaphylaxis. Monitoring for signs and symptoms such as hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress is crucial.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 113/55 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and volume status is necessary to prevent further decline.
3. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory compromise. Monitoring for signs of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and decreased oxygen saturation, is essential.
4. Infection: The patient's history of antibiotic use and potential allergic reactions may indicate an increased risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, is crucial.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and low-molecular-weight heparin, should be implemented.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the underlying medical condition and ICU stay. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia, is necessary.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of VAP. Monitoring for signs of pneumonia, such as fever, tachypnea, and altered mental status, is essential."

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) who presented to the ICU for monitored administration of abatacept, a medication he had previously reacted to with an anaphylactoid reaction. The patient received premedication with famotidine, benadryl, and solumedrol, and was started on higher-dose prednisone. During the 24-hour monitoring period, the patient experienced mild allergic reaction symptoms, including swelling of the hands, chest tightness, and mild dyspnea, which were resolved with treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device, but not currently using it.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, sclera anicteric, and no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's laboratory results and radiology images are not provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for 24 hours after the initial infusion, continuing higher-dose prednisone, and continuing famotidine and benadryl for 24 hours post-infusion. The patient's other medical conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, IBD, and DM2, are being managed with medication and dietary changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's previous anaphylactoid reaction to abatacept, there is a risk of anaphylaxis during or after the infusion.
2. Allergic reaction: The patient's mild allergic reaction symptoms during the 24-hour monitoring period may worsen or become more severe.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mild dyspnea and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's DM2 and hold PO hypoglycemics may put them at risk for hypoglycemia.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's DM2 and lack of insulin therapy may put them at risk for hyperglycemia.
6. Infection: The patient's IBD and DM2 may increase their risk of infection.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's IBD and DM2 may increase their risk of VTE.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's IBD and use of flagyl may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."
