 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 HEMOPTYSIS
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery with recurrent
   hemoptysis.
   # Hemoptysis: most likely secondary to bleeding bronchial vessel.  In
   light of recent history of hemorrhaging LLL bronchial artery, this
   seems to be most likely source.  Because this was not able to be
   intervened on endobronciolly at the time of last IP procedure, IP and
   IR feel that it's again likely to require embolization procedure.
   - IR fellow and I attempting to reach patient's wife for consent, will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Known LLL mass with recurrent hemoptysis
* Hypotension
* Coagulopathy
* Anemia
* CAD with known coronary artery disease
* DM2 with hyperglycemia
* FEN with NPO status

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Transfusing blood products to maintain a hemoglobin level above 30 and a platelet count above 50,000/μL
* Continuing L-tipped positioning and attempting to continue R mainstem intubation
* Monitoring hemoglobin and platelet counts every 4 hours
* Transfusing blood products as needed
* Continuing stress-dose steroids if not off pressors later today
* Discussing with primary oncology team to defer further treatment
* Holding metoprolol while hypotensive
* Continuing PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and coagulopathy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding due to coagulopathy or hemoptysis
* Hypotension and shock
* Respiratory failure due to mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac complications due to CAD and hypotension
* Renal failure due to hypotension and coagulopathy
* Infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility
* Gastrointestinal complications due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and hypotension
* Hemolytic anemia due to CLL and coagulopathy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a large left lung mass, who presented with hemoptysis and was treated with bronchial artery embolization. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving mechanical ventilation and sedation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/49 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. He has a SpO2 of 99% and is receiving oxygen via an endotracheal tube.

The patient has been experiencing bradycardia without change in blood pressure or respiratory rate, and has removed his own oral gastric tube. He has been weaned off levophed and is currently receiving propofol, famotidine, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, troponin-T, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination is notable for constricted pupils, endotracheal tube in place, and diminished breath sounds. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are warm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's hemoptysis and elevated troponin-T levels suggest bleeding complications, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the use of mechanical ventilation and sedation may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest cardiac injury, which may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal impairment, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated LDH levels and diminished breath sounds suggest infection, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to bleeding complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and respiratory status may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hemoptysis is likely secondary to bleeding bronchial vessels, and he will be monitored closely for signs of rebleeding. The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of positive pressure ventilation and medication effect, and he will be monitored closely for signs of hypotension. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia will be managed with transfusions and continued treatment with prednisone. The patient's cardiac status will be monitored closely, and he will be managed with close monitoring of his electrolyte levels and cardiac enzymes. The patient's respiratory status will be monitored closely, and he will be managed with close monitoring of his respiratory rate and oxygen saturation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology. He presented with recurrent hemoptysis and was intubated due to massive hemoptysis. He has been stable for over 36 hours without evidence of rebleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 65 K/uL, and troponin of 0.36 ng/mL. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 16.1 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 27.6 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4.

The patient's imaging studies are negative for new radiologic abnormalities. His microbiology results are also negative for new cultures.

The patient's assessment is that he has CLL, coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology, with recurrent hemoptysis. His plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor his condition closely. He will be extubated after a bronchoscopy to clean up any remaining blood in his airway. He will also receive nutrition and glycemic control after extubation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) increase his risk of developing an infection.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient's history of massive hemoptysis and ongoing bleeding from his lung masses may lead to further respiratory compromise.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of NSTEMI and abnormal troponin levels may indicate ongoing cardiac instability.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and his prolonged hospitalization may lead to malnutrition and associated complications.
7. Wound complications: The patient's presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) and his coagulopathy may increase his risk of developing wound complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology. He has a recent history of massive hemoptysis and underwent brachial artery embolization. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been stable for over 36 hours without evidence of rebleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 65. His coagulation studies show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4.

The patient's imaging studies, including chest X-rays, have not shown any new abnormalities. His microbiology studies have not detected any new infections.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hemoptysis has been stable for over 36 hours, and it is not clear how much bleeding occurred before he was intubated. After discussion with the intensivist and interventional radiologist, it was decided not to perform additional procedures due to the risks outweighing the benefits. The patient will be monitored closely, and a chest X-ray will be obtained to determine if a clean-up bronchoscopy is necessary before extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: Despite the patient's stability, there is still a risk of bleeding, particularly given his coagulopathy.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a nosocomial infection, particularly given his prolonged stay in the ICU.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and the risk of bleeding.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent history of NSTEMI and his ongoing treatment with anticoagulation medications make him at risk for cardiovascular complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential for prolonged stay in the ICU make him at risk for neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology. He has a recent history of massive hemoptysis after left lower lobe brachial artery embolization and has been intubated. He has been unstable for over 36 hours without evidence of rebleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a ventilator with a PSV/SBT mode, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He has a Foley catheter and is receiving IV fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of massive hemoptysis make him at high risk for bleeding complications, including rebleeding or bleeding from other sites.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung masses and respiratory support may increase his risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his lung function deteriorates or if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization make him at risk for sepsis, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and troponin trended down, but he may still be at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and respiratory support may increase his risk of neurological complications, including delirium, seizures, or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's coagulopathy and immunocompromised state may increase his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization make him at risk for infection, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a large left lung mass, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hemoptysis. He underwent bronchoscopy and embolization of the bronchial artery to control bleeding. The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable since admission with no evidence of rebleeding. His hemoglobin (Hct) level has been stable, and he is currently making urine.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hypotension, and hypertension. His creatinine (Cr) level was elevated to 1.7 yesterday but has since decreased to 1.6. He has a history of hypertension, tachycardia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.7-1.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hct): 30.6-29.3%
* Platelet count (Plt): 65-49 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4-1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.36-0.10 ng/mL
* Glucose: 183-143 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB, Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Differential-Neuts, Albumin, LDH, Ca++/Mg++/PO4

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding has been stable since admission, but there is still a risk of rebleeding.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory complications due to his underlying lung disease and recent embolization procedure.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may be related to his underlying cardiovascular disease, and he may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level has been elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Infection complications: The patient has a history of recent hemoptysis and may be at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia.
* Oncologic complications: The patient has a diagnosis of CLL and may be at risk for further complications related to his underlying cancer, such as progression of disease or development of secondary cancers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and hemoptysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/70 mmHg. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which was stopped overnight, and is being monitored for respiratory status.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 65. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for a bronchoscopy procedure, which was performed yesterday. The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics, including cefipime and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's altered mental status, hypotension, and hemoptysis, there is a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient undergoes further invasive procedures.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory status and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.

Based on this assessment, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with a focus on optimizing respiratory status, managing electrolyte imbalances, and treating any underlying infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and recurrent respiratory papillary adenocarcinoma (RCC) who was admitted with hemoptysis, concerning for large volume. He underwent bronchoscopy and emobolization of the left lower lobe bronchial artery, and was extubated uneventfully yesterday. Today, he was noted to have delirium, and his vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, and blood pressure of 154/79 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination was notable for right lower extremity edema, and his laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 65 K/uL. His electrolyte levels were within normal limits, and his liver function tests were slightly elevated.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hemoptysis: resolved, with underlying mediastinal masses concerning for possible CLL.
2. Delirium: likely due to medications (benzos) and ICU delirium. Plan to use antipsychotics, starting standing Seroquel with prn Haldol, and follow QTc.
3. CLL: neutropenic now, and will be followed by Onc.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: due to mediastinal masses and possible erosion of vascular left hilar mass into bronchus.
2. Bleeding: due to emobolization of the left lower lobe bronchial artery and possible erosion of vascular left hilar mass into bronchus.
3. Infection: due to neutropenia and possible erosion of vascular left hilar mass into bronchus.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: due to possible electrolyte imbalance and QTc prolongation.
5. Neurological complications: due to possible ICU delirium and antipsychotic medications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: due to possible stress ulcer and H2 blocker prophylaxis.
7. Renal failure: due to possible electrolyte imbalance and dehydration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and watch for signs of respiratory failure.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and watch for signs of bleeding.
3. Monitor the patient's infection status and watch for signs of infection.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and watch for signs of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and watch for signs of neurological complications.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and watch for signs of gastrointestinal complications.
7. Monitor the patient's renal status and watch for signs of renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and remote renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He has been readmitted with hemoptysis, concerning for large volume, and has undergone bronchoscopy with stable left lower lobe (LLL) clot noted. He was extubated uneventfully yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 112 bpm (normal range: 87-136 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 154/79 mmHg (normal range: 108-159/65-97 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-36 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, likely due to medications (benzodiazepines) or ICU delirium. He is being treated with antipsychotics and will be monitored for QTc prolongation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.7 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 65 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* TropT: 0.36 ng/mL (normal range: <0.1 ng/mL)

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with neutropenia
* Remote renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with mediastinal masses and left bronchial artery bleed
* Delirium due to medications or ICU delirium
* Hemoptysis with underlying mediastinal masses concerning for possible CLL
* Respiratory instability with decreased oxygen saturation
* Potential for bleeding complications due to platelet count <150 x 10^9/L
* Risk of infection due to neutropenia
* Risk of sepsis due to underlying medical conditions

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring of hemoptysis and respiratory status
* Follow-up with oncology for workup and treatment of CLL
* Management of delirium with antipsychotics and monitoring for QTc prolongation
* Avoidance of benzodiazepines
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* Transfer to the floor for further care."
