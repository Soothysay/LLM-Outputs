   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with hypotension/sepsis all concerning
   for cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain in the setting of
   decreased po intake and now with progressive dyspnea and peripheral
   edema.  Initially she was treated for UTI with bactrim with incomplete
   response.  She then evolved worsening abdominal discomfort and was
   found to have severe obstruction of biliary system with obstructing
   stone and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care in
   anticipation of ERCP and stone removal.
   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-_Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   CHOLANGITIS
S/P ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE-
   -Will need ECHO to follow up and define EF
   -Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive
   -Follow enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including sepsis, cholangitis, respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise.

The patient's sepsis is likely related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis, which may have led to acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to poor lung compliance, which may be exacerbated by the presence of emesis and possible aspiration during intubation.

The patient's congestive heart failure is likely related to her underlying cardiac condition, and the patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored with serial echocardiograms to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The patient's cholangitis is a critical condition that requires prompt treatment, including antibiotics and possible stenting or surgical intervention. The patient's mass at the papilla is a concerning finding that may be related to cholangiocarcinoma, and further evaluation with imaging studies and pathology is necessary to determine the optimal treatment plan.

The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is likely due to sepsis and poor perfusion, and close monitoring of urine output, creatinine levels, and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further kidney damage. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium and magnesium, are abnormal and require close monitoring and correction.

The patient's bleeding risk is elevated due to her anticoagulation therapy, and close monitoring of her coagulation studies is necessary to prevent bleeding complications. The patient's glycemic control is also critical, and close monitoring of her blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple comorbidities. The patient's sepsis, cholangitis, respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure require prompt treatment, and the patient's bleeding risk and glycemic control require close monitoring. Further evaluation with imaging studies and pathology is necessary to determine the optimal treatment plan for the patient's mass at the papilla."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an elderly, overweight woman who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which revealed a fungating 4cm mass in the papilla concerning for adenoCA. Biopsy of the mass was obtained, and a stent was placed. The patient was intubated for ERCP and remained intubated due to failing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with abnormal blood gas (ABG) values.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), which showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed a large hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, which is concerning for neoplasm.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Hypotension and need for vasopressors: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of vasopressors such as Levophed and Vasopressin.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient has had low urine output, which may indicate acute kidney injury or dehydration.
3. Neurological concerns: The patient has developed a dilated, fixed, dyscoric right pupil, which may indicate a neurological emergency.
4. Respiratory concerns: The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.
5. Infectious concerns: The patient has been receiving antibiotics and has had a urine culture that showed no growth. A blood culture is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's dilated, fixed, dyscoric right pupil may indicate a neurological emergency, such as a stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
5. Infection: The patient's antibiotic use and pending blood culture results may indicate an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Based on this information, I recommend that the patient's care team continue to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening respiratory or neurological distress, and consider adjusting her treatment plan to address these concerns."

   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following a one-month history of abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and has had a hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and on ventilator support with minimal resistance, suggesting poor compliance.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, with a normal biventricular cavity size and preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function on TTE.
* Renal: Acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.8, and a urine output of 50-100cc/hr.
* Neurological: Right frontal lobe hypodense lesion on CT head, concerning for metastatic lesion, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely related to the biliary obstruction with cholangitis and cholecystitis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to poor compliance and may require weaning of ventilator support.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is likely related to the fungating mass in the ampullary region, and biopsy results are pending.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to intrinsic process, and urine output has improved recently.
5. dCHF: The patient's clinical diagnosis of heart failure is supported by her TTE, which demonstrated preserved EF.
6. Ischemia: The patient's ischemia to her extremities is likely related to her septic shock and may require further management.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's right frontal lobe hypodense lesion on CT head, concerning for metastatic lesion, may require further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary source.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Avoid nephrotoxic medications and renally dose all medications.
4. Trend creatinine and electrolytes to monitor for acute renal failure.
5. Continue heparin therapy to prevent DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further evaluation and management of the right frontal lobe hypodense lesion.
7. Wean ventilator support as possible and consider moving to PSV when able."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has evidence of emesis peri-intubation, but no aspiration was admitted to. She has wheezing and minimal resistance on the ventilator, consistent with poor compliance.
* Septic shock: The patient has likely septic shock related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis, with a mass seen at the papilla suggesting obstruction may be related to the mass.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has above-baseline creatinine levels and sepsis, likely leading to poor perfusion and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Cholangitis: The patient had a stent placed during ERCP, and will need drainage and pathology on the mass to determine long-term intervention and treatment.
* CHF: The patient's cardiac function is unknown, and will need an echocardiogram to define ejection fraction (EF).

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating ongoing inflammation.
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, suggesting liver dysfunction.
* Elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating cardiac injury.
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.

The patient's imaging studies are also concerning, with:

* A large hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe on CT head, consistent with a neoplasm or metastatic lesion.
* A progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left hemithorax on CXR, likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued coverage for abdominal and possible pulmonary sources with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
* Monitoring of cultures and clinical course to look for resolution of sepsis.
* Weaning of ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
* Follow-up echocardiogram to define ejection fraction.
* Pathology on the mass to determine long-term intervention and treatment.
* Drainage of the stent and monitoring of urine output to avoid nephrotoxic medications.
* Trending of creatinine levels and checking of urine lytes and sediment to monitor for acute renal failure.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   #
   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   CHOLANGITIS
S/P ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE-
   -Will need ECHO to follow up and define EF
   -Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive
   -Follow enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.

   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. Her hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.
* Cardiovascular: tachycardic, with a heart rate of 120 bpm, and a blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg and is receiving vasoactive medications, including Levophed and Vasopressin.
* Neurological: the patient has a new right fixed, dilated pupil, and a head CT scan showed a large hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, concerning for a metastatic lesion.
* Renal: the patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and a urine output of 895 mL.
* Gastrointestinal: the patient has cholangitis, with a stent placed following ERCP, and a possible cholangiocarcinoma.
* Hematology: the patient has a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 117 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the ongoing infection
* Acute kidney injury and need for renal replacement therapy
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability and need for vasoactive medications
* Neurological deterioration and potential need for neurosurgical intervention
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the presence of a stent and possible cholangiocarcinoma

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics to cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary sources of sepsis
* IV fluids to maintain adequate hydration
* Vasopressors to support blood pressure
* Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and septic shock
* Follow-up imaging studies to monitor for progression of the metastatic lesion and potential need for neurosurgical intervention.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.

   -Continue with A/C
   SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-_Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock from cholangitis following ERCP, demonstrating a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She was intubated for ERCP and has been unable to be weaned from mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors, and has undergone several interventions, including ERCP, stent placement, and biopsy of the mass. She has also had several lab tests and imaging studies, including a CT head, which showed a large hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe concerning for neoplasm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is low, and she has a history of sepsis, which may have led to poor perfusion and resultant ATN.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has poor compliance on the ventilator, which may require weaning to PSV.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high suspicion of sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis, which may lead to further complications, such as pancreatitis or sepsis.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's ECHO showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, but she has a history of hypertension and may be at risk for CHF.
6. Stroke: The patient's CT head showed a large hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe concerning for neoplasm, which may be related to a stroke.
7. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which may lead to thrombosis, especially in the lower extremities.
8. Infection: The patient has a high suspicion of infection, which may lead to sepsis, pneumonia, or other complications.
9. Malignancy: The patient's biopsy of the mass showed a fungating mass, which may be related to a malignancy, such as cholangiocarcinoma.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors as needed.
2. Monitor urine output and trend creatinine.
3. Avoid nephrotoxic medications.
4. Check urine lytes and urine sediment.
5. Wean ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
6. Move to PSV when able.
7. Continue with A/C.
8. Follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution of sepsis.
9. Look for drainage of the mass and pathology results to guide long-term intervention and treatment.
10. Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive medications.
11. Follow enzymes to monitor for CHF.
12. Monitor for signs of stroke, thrombosis, and infection.
13. Consider MRI to further characterize the mass and rule out stroke."

   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP. She was intubated for respiratory failure and has a history of abdominal pain, which was found to be due to a fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She has developed limb ischemia, acute renal failure, and anemia, and is currently on pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's new right fixed, dilated pupil and hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe on CT scan are concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is not responding to treatment, and her SVO2 is 94%, indicating inadequate oxygenation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's poor compliance on the ventilator and high ABG values indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine and non-gap acidosis suggest intrinsic renal failure, which may be due to ATN.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 117 to 107, indicating a high risk of bleeding.
6. Limb Ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally indicate severe limb ischemia.
7. Malignancy: The patient's fungating mass in the ampullary region is concerning for malignancy, which may have metastasized to the brain.

Plan:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. Follow up with Neurology and consider Mannitol and IV steroids.
3. Continue IVF boluses and pressors.
4. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjust regimen as necessary.

   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).
   Microbiology: Urine cx [**4-12**]: no growth

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Patient
   is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as broad-spectrum
   antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically remains severely ill
   and unresponsive.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP. She developed a fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy and was intubated for respiratory failure. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, pressors, and vasopressors. Her condition has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil.

Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock has been refractory to treatment, and she remains hypotensive despite receiving pressors and vasopressors.
2. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally, with no dopperable dp pulses. She has been recommended to restart heparin gtt, but it has been held due to the discovery of a pupillary defect.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has poor compliance on the ventilator. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.4, PaCO2 of 21, and PaO2 of 159.
4. Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: The patient's creatinine has risen to 1.8, and her urine electrolytes show a FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic renal failure.
5. dCHF: The patient has a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, but her TTE shows preserved EF.
6. GERD: The patient is taking a PPI at home and is being continued on ranitidine for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation or brainstem lesion: The patient's new right fixed, dilated pupil and impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex are concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient's hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe may be causing cerebral edema.
3. Stroke: The patient's ischemia to her extremities and lack of dopperable dp pulses may be indicative of a stroke.
4. Sepsis-related organ failure: The patient's septic shock may lead to organ failure, including renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular failure.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Neurosurgery consult.
4. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
5. No anticoagulation for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock from cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and is receiving pressors for hypotension. She has developed ischemia to her extremities, including a fixed, dilated pupil on the right side, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. She has also developed acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is unresponsive to boluses and she is requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure. Her SVO2 is 94%, and her CVP is 11. Her lactate level is elevated to 4.5.
2. Limb Ischemia: The patient has developed cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally. She has also developed some mottling of the right hand. Vascular surgery has been consulted, and Heparin gtt was initially given but held for CVL placement.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 21, and pO2 of 159.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, which is concerning for malignancy. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Acute Renal Failure with Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient has developed acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.8. Her urine electrolytes show a FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of an intrinsic process likely ATN.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, with a hemoglobin level of 24.0. She has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 107, which is a small drop from her admission platelet count of 117.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's fixed, dilated pupil on the right side is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. A repeat stat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. Ischemic Stroke: The patient's ischemia to her extremities is concerning for ischemic stroke. A repeat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
3. Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is unresponsive to boluses, and she is requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure. Her SVO2 is 94%, and her CVP is 11. Her lactate level is elevated to 4.5.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 21, and pO2 of 159.
5. Cholangitis-Related Complications: The patient's cholangitis is concerning for complications such as cholangitis-related sepsis, cholangitis-related pancreatitis, and cholangitis-related liver failure.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure is concerning for acute kidney injury. A repeat creatinine level is recommended to evaluate for worsening kidney function.
7. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia is concerning for thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A repeat platelet count is recommended to evaluate for worsening thrombocytopenia.

Plan:

1. Continue IVF boluses to maintain blood pressure.
2. Continue pressors to maintain blood pressure.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for cholangitis.
4. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
5. F/U Neurology recs.
6. Head of bed elevation >30 degrees.
7. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
8. Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation and consult Neurosurgery.
9. No anticoagulation for now.
10. Family meeting.

Note: The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and the plan should be individualized based on her specific needs and response to treatment."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. UOP initially poor
   (~20cc/hr), but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may
   indicate improved end-organ perfusion.
   -Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. UOP initially poor
   (~20cc/hr), but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may
   indicate improved end-organ perfusion.
   -Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. She has undergone ERCP and stenting, and has been treated with antibiotics and pressors. Her condition has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of cholangitis, and her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Her imaging studies show a large hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe, concerning for a neoplasm with vasogenic edema.

The patient's medical conditions include septic shock, respiratory failure, cholangitis, acute renal failure, and dCHF. She is receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, pressors, and diuretics. Her laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and her urine output has been poor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics, pressors, and other supportive measures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a complication of her septic shock and requires close monitoring and management with mechanical ventilation.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is a serious infection that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a complication of her septic shock and requires close monitoring and management with diuretics and other supportive measures.
5. dCHF: The patient's dCHF is a complication of her septic shock and requires close monitoring and management with diuretics and other supportive measures.
6. Metastatic Lesion: The patient's metastatic lesion in the right frontal lobe is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and management with imaging studies and other supportive measures.
7. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt is a potential complication of HIT, which requires close monitoring and management with anticoagulation therapy and other supportive measures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy and pressors to manage septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue treatment for cholangitis with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's dCHF closely and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
6. Continue imaging studies to monitor the patient's metastatic lesion and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed to manage HIT."

   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She was intubated for respiratory failure and has been on pressors for hypotension. She has developed ischemia to her extremities, including a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion concerning for metastatic lesion, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil. She has also developed acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis and anemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is unresponsive to boluses and requires two pressors. Her SVO2 is 94%, and her CVP is 11. Her lactate level is elevated to 4.5.
2. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of her LE. She has also developed ischemia to her right hand.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has poor compliance on the ventilator. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.4 and a PCO2 of 21.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy.
5. Acute Renal Failure with Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient has developed acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis and anemia.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and she is at risk for further blood loss.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's right frontal lobe hypodense lesion may be causing herniation, which could lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure and poor compliance on the ventilator put her at risk for developing ARDS.
3. ATN: The patient's acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis suggests that she may have developed ATN, which could lead to further kidney damage.
4. DIC: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy suggest that she may be developing DIC, which could lead to further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
5. Heart Failure: The patient's TTE shows preserved EF, but she carries a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, which could lead to further cardiac deterioration.

Plan:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. Follow up with Neurology and consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
3. Hold off on percutaneous chole drainage for now, but can revisit after results of head CT.
4. Continue IVF boluses, pressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Follow up with Vascular surgery and consider Nitro paste on extremities.
6. Continue to trend creatinine and follow up with Renal team.
7. Transfuse 1u pRBCs given end-organ ischemia and possible improved volume resuscitation.
8. Continue to trend platelet count and follow up with Hematology team.
9. Hold home Lasix and Lopressor and follow up with Cardiology team.
10. Continue Ranitidine for prophylaxis."

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: GI biopsy [**4-13**]: pending
   CBD brushing [**4-13**]: pending
   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).
   Microbiology: Urine cx [**4-12**]: no growth

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour events, the following potential medical complications have arisen:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection has progressed, and they are now septic, with a SVO2 of 94%, CVP of 11, and lactate elevated to 4.5.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial and was reintubated. They have poor compliance on the ventilator and require ongoing mechanical ventilation.
3. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the LE bilaterally, indicating potential limb ischemia.
4. Acute Renal Failure with non-gap acidosis: The patient has rising creatinine, and their urine electrolytes suggest an intrinsic process likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin has decreased to 24.0, indicating significant blood loss from attempted CVL and fluid boluses.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 107, indicating a small platelet drop from 117 on admission.
7. Right Frontal Lobe Hypodensity: The patient has a new right frontal lobe hypodensity lesion concerning for metastatic lesion, which may be related to the patient's known malignancy.
8. Pupilary Abnormality: The patient has a fixed, dilated right pupil, which may indicate herniation or brainstem lesion.
9. Cholangitis: The patient has a large fungating mass at the ampulla, which may be malignant, and is at risk for further complications.
10. dCHF: The patient has a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, but the TTE only demonstrates preserved EF, and no E/E or E/A ratio was obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction.

The patient requires ongoing management for these complications, including:

* Continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for cholangitis
* Ongoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure
* Management of sepsis with fluid resuscitation and pressors
* Monitoring and treatment of limb ischemia
* Renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure
* Transfusion of packed red blood cells for anemia
* Platelet transfusions for thrombocytopenia
* Management of the right frontal lobe hypodensity lesion, including repeat head CT and potential surgical intervention
* Management of the pupilary abnormality, including repeat head CT and potential neurosurgical intervention
* Ongoing monitoring of cardiac function and treatment of dCHF

It is essential to continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has undergone CVL placement, but the procedure was unsuccessful. She has also been on pressors and has required intubation due to respiratory failure.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Limb ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally, as well as some mottling of the right hand.
2. Acute Renal Failure with non-gap acidosis: The patient has a rising creatinine and lactate levels, and urine electrolytes suggest an intrinsic process likely due to ATN.
3. Anemia: The patient has a worsening anemia, and transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs has been ordered.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a small PLT drop, and DIC labs are pending.
5. Right frontal lobe hypodensity: The patient has a new right frontal lobe hypodensity lesion, concerning for metastatic lesion.
6. Unilateral fixed and dilated right pupil: The patient has a new right pupil defect, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Head of bed elevation >30 degrees.
4. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
5. Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation and consult Neurosurgery.
6. No anticoagulation for now.
7. Family meeting.
8. Continue IVF boluses.
9. Continue pressors.
10. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
11. F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN.
12. F/U final surgery recs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cerebral edema or herniation due to the right frontal lobe hypodensity lesion.
2. Worsening of limb ischemia, potentially leading to tissue necrosis or amputation.
3. Progression of acute renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Further deterioration of anemia, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
5. Development of DIC, potentially leading to bleeding or organ dysfunction.
6. Worsening of respiratory failure, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.
7. Progression of septic shock, potentially leading to multi-organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Patient is currently on Levophed and
   Vasopressin as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this
   AM, but clinically remains severely ill and unresponsive.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Patient is currently on Levophed and
   Vasopressin as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this
   AM, but clinically remains severely ill and unresponsive.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. The patient underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

The patient's current status is:

* Respiratory: Intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 120 bpm, and requiring two pressors (Levophed and Vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure.
* Neurological: Unresponsive off sedation, with a right fixed, dilated pupil, and a hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe on CT scan.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury, with a baseline Cr of 1.1 and currently Cr of 1.8.
* Gastrointestinal: Cholangitis with a 10cm fungating mass at the ampulla, and a biopsy of the mass pending.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cerebral edema or herniation due to the hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe.
* Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension.
* Renal failure or worsening of acute kidney injury due to the patient's underlying condition and treatment.
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's underlying infection and treatment.
* Limb ischemia or gangrene due to the patient's cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and feet.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
* F/U Neurology recs.
* Neurosurgery consult.
* Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
* No anticoagulation for now.
* Family meeting.
* Continue IVF boluses.
* Continue pressors.
* Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn.
* F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN.
* F/U Vascular surgery recs.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female with iniital admission with sepsis and cholangitis found
   to have concerning mass lesion in ampulla consistent with
   adenocarcinoma and course complicated by persistent sepsis and
   respiratory failure with evolution of limb ischemia and persistent
   altered mental status.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-This is secondary to
   severe metabolic acidosis with associated respiratory failure in the
   setting fo bilateral effusions.
   -Will continue with support with optimized ventilatory support
   -Will need to consider patient at high risk for evolution of ARDS
   -We will see continued need for maintenance of effective ventilation to
   look to sedate patient to tolerate effective ventilation.
   -Will look to maintain Ve at 8-10 with Vt at 6cc/Kg at this time
   -Will need titration to ABG across the day
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-Persistent and severe compromise in
   perfusion despite CVP at >12 and requiring 2 pressors and now adding a
   3^rd.  ScVO2 has been >90%, we have CVP at 12 this morning.  This is
   all consistent with severe vasodilatory state with distributative shock
   with concern for infection from possible biliary source and or possible
   pneumonia.  We will need to reverse infection with
   -Evaluation with radiology to consider percutaneous drainage of
   gallbladder system
   -Pulmonary opacities are seen with collapse suggested in LLL with
   associated bilateral infusions
   -Will maintain support with pressors
   -Antibiotics with vanco/cefepime/Zosyn/Flagyl
   -Will utilize pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure support.
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim if not responding
   3)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-METABOLIC ACIDOSIS-
   -Will look to support through what is likely ATN at this time
   -Will continue to utilize pressors in excess of fluids at this time
   -Renal dose medications
   4)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS--WITH HYPODENSITY ON CT SCAN
now with
   persistent COMA-This is with decreased responsiveness and concern for
   new focal density with metastatic disease postulated.
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of metastatic disease
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be a contribution of toxic-metabolic insult with sepsis
   -We do have a concern for possible CNS bleed but not seen on repeat CT
   this morning
   -Neurology following and will return to anticoagulation
   5)CHOLANGITIS-_We have stent placed with drainage but now with
   persistent and severe sepsis.  We do not see clear evidence of
   persistent obstruction but will have to consider imaging with radiology
   to consider drainage in light of
   6)LIMB ISCHEMIA-
   -Return to IV heparin at this time given concern for thrombus in lower
   extremity
   -Will follow with vascular surgery and trial nitro-paste to area
   locally to work to maintain optimal perfusion of distal extremity
   -Will need diagnostic testing for evaluation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Total time spent: 75 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical condition. She was initially admitted with sepsis and cholangitis, and has since developed respiratory failure, altered mental status, and limb ischemia.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to severe metabolic acidosis with associated respiratory failure in the setting of bilateral effusions. She requires continued support with optimized ventilatory support, and is at high risk for evolution of ARDS.

The patient's sepsis is persistent and severe, with a compromise in perfusion despite CVP at >12 and requiring three pressors. She has a severe vasodilatory state with distributative shock, and concern for infection from possible biliary source and/or possible pneumonia.

The patient has acute renal failure with metabolic acidosis, and will require support through what is likely ATN. She also has altered mental status, which is likely due to a combination of metastatic disease, toxic-metabolic insult with sepsis, and possible CNS bleed.

The patient's limb ischemia is concerning, and she will require return to IV heparin at this time given concern for thrombus in the lower extremity. She will also require diagnostic testing for evaluation.

The patient's ICU care plan includes tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Evolution of ARDS
* Development of further sepsis or organ dysfunction
* Progression of acute renal failure
* Worsening of limb ischemia
* Development of further CNS complications, such as hemorrhage or edema
* Failure to respond to treatment, leading to a poor prognosis

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Admission: Septic Shock s/p ERCP
   24 Hour Events:
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - progressively more hypotensive, maxed out on neo, levo, and
   vasopressin
   - on exam this AM @5:30, concern patient with dilated, fixed right
   pupil so heparin stopped but head CT was stable
   - plan to replace CVL, RIJ vs. subclavian but given worsening clinical
   status, this was deferred
   - CT-CAP: 1. 6mm RUL nodule, 2. extensive mediastinal LAD suggestive of
   lymphoma, 3. b/l pleural effusion with atelectasis, 4. cholelithiasis,
   5. splenic infarcts, 6. renal infarct, umbilical hernia with hyperdense
   lesion likely barium in diverticulum vs strangulated epiploic
   appendigitis.
   - path prelim read: high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor,
   but possibly lymphoma vs. carcinoma vs less likely melanoma.  stains
   pending
   - family meeting --> patient made DNR/DNI with no escalation of care
   - started on bicarb drip for worsening metabolic acidosis
   - heparin restarted
   - steroids started for empiric treatment of lymphoma and for refractory
   shock
   - added on tumor lysis labs given starting steroids.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis following ERCP. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. She has developed several complications, including:

* Septic shock, unresponsive to boluses, requiring two pressors
* Limb ischemia, with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the LE
* Respiratory failure, intubated peri-procedure, unable to be weaned from the ventilator
* Acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis, likely due to receipt of HCO3
* Anemia, with a small PLT drop
* Thrombocytopenia, with a small PLT drop
* dCHF, with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure

The patient's condition has worsened, and she has developed a fixed, dilated right pupil, concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. She has been started on bicarbonate drip for worsening metabolic acidosis and steroids for empiric treatment of lymphoma and refractory shock.

Potential medical complications:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and anemia
* Increased risk of renal failure due to non-gap acidosis and acute renal failure
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to ARDS and respiratory muscle weakness
* Increased risk of limb ischemia due to poor perfusion and potential for further deterioration
* Increased risk of septic shock due to ongoing sepsis and potential for further deterioration
* Increased risk of brain herniation due to fixed, dilated right pupil and potential for further deterioration
* Increased risk of cardiac complications due to dCHF and potential for further deterioration"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension requiring 3 pressors, unresponsive
   to IVF boluses. CVP 18. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Patient is
   currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Family would like to gather to readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   - family meeting, may make patient CMO and withdraw supportive
   measures.
   # Coma: likely [**2-24**] sepsis, also with new ? brain mets.  Appreciate
   neuro input, though further neuro w/u deferred given overall prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Likely [**2-24**] pressor, though also possible thrombus, given
   initial unilateral presenation, renal and splenic infacts on ct.
   - heparin gtt
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Currently hypercarbic on LTTV.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters
   - increase Tv to increase pH, decrease pCO2
   - Repeat ABG
   # Ampulllary Mass/Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: path from ampulla showed
   high grade undifferentiated malignant tumor.  Mediastinal LAD
   susp[icious for lymphoma.  Regardless, given current clinical scenario,
   cancer diagnosis only contributes to a grim prognosis, and further w/u
   unnecessary.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - steroids
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - continue bicarbonate gtt
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Trend creatinine, lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension requiring 3 pressors, unresponsive
   to IVF boluses. CVP 18. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Patient is
   currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Family would like to gather to readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   - family meeting, may make patient CMO and withdraw supportive
   measures.
   # Coma: likely [**2-24**] sepsis, also with new ? brain mets.  Appreciate
   neuro input, though further neuro w/u deferred given overall prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Likely [**2-24**] pressor, though also possible thrombus, given
   initial unilateral presenation, renal and splenic infacts on ct.
   - heparin gtt
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Currently hypercarbic on LTTV.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters
   - increase Tv to increase pH, decrease pCO2
   - Repeat ABG
   # Ampulllary Mass/Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: path from ampulla showed
   high grade undifferentiated malignant tumor.  Mediastinal LAD
   susp[icious for lymphoma.  Regardless, given current clinical scenario,
   cancer diagnosis only contributes to a grim prognosis, and further w/u
   unnecessary.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - steroids
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - continue bicarbonate gtt
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Trend creatinine, lytes

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP, complicated by unresponsiveness, limb ischemia, and possible right frontal lobe metastasis. The patient has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, suspected to be malignant, and has been treated with maximum doses of three pressors. The patient has a grave prognosis and has made a DNR (do not resuscitate) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
2. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE, which may progress to gangrene or require amputation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has hypercarbic on LTTV, which may lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has rising creatinine and non-gap acidosis, which may progress to end-stage renal disease or require dialysis.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has tachycardia and hypotension, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has a possible right frontal lobe metastasis, which may lead to further neurological complications such as seizures, brain edema, or herniation.
7. Cancer Progression: The patient has a high-grade undifferentiated malignant tumor, which may progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications and a poorer prognosis.
8. Infection: The patient has a biliary infection, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis, abscesses, or peritonitis.
9. Thrombotic Complications: The patient has a hypercoagulable state, which may lead to further thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or stroke.

These potential medical complications highlight the complexity and gravity of the patient's condition, and emphasize the need for close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a septic shock patient with a history of ERCP, who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including a high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor, lymphoma, and cholelithiasis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening hypotension, requiring maximum doses of vasopressors. The patient has also developed a dilated, fixed right pupil, which led to the discontinuation of heparin. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a need for mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis has led to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and liver dysfunction.
2. Malignancy-related complications: The patient's high-grade malignant tumor may lead to further complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, or metastases.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's dilated, fixed right pupil and worsening coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the need for mechanical ventilation may lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate drip and steroid therapy may exacerbate metabolic acidosis, which can lead to further complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis and immunosuppression may increase the risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cholelithiasis and history of ERCP may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the presence of coagulopathy.
8. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors may lead to further cardiovascular instability, including cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multi-organ dysfunction, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 3
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Critically
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 3
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Critically
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is rising, and they have non-gap acidosis, which can indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has prolonged coagulation times, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a right frontal lobe hypodensity, which may indicate a metastatic lesion or a toxic or metabolic process. The patient's pupillary response is impaired, which may indicate herniation or a brainstem lesion.
8. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the LE, which may indicate limb ischemia.
9. Cholangitis: The patient has a 10cm fungating mass at the ampulla, which may indicate cholangitis or a malignant process.
10. Metastatic Disease: The patient has a 6mm RUL nodule and extensive mediastinal LAD, which may indicate metastatic disease.

Given the patient's severe illness and grave prognosis, it is essential to monitor their condition closely and address any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted with chlangitis and now with refractory septic
   shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning
   for widespread malignancy.  She has had persistent sepsis with
   inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues as evidenced by
   continued rise in lactate.  We have persistent acidemia despite
   maximized support on the ventilator and utilization of the bicarbonate
   drip.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -We have continued to maintain low tidal volume ventilation as
   protective strategy to minimize ARDS risk
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-
   -Steroids in place
   -Pressors at maxium
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics in place
   -Ongoing fluid bolus without effect of durable response in terms of
   blood pressure stability.
   3)Cholangitis-Patient with mass lesion obstructing biliary system with
   stent drainage in place which has local control but we are left with
   diffuse and extensive cancer
   -Continue drainage
   4)Acidemia-
   -Persistent anion gap acidosis with optimization of vent support
   -Will need to continue with HCO3- gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with cholangitis and refractory septic shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning for widespread malignancy. She has persistent sepsis with inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues, as evidenced by continued rise in lactate. The patient has respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholangitis, and acidemia. She is receiving pressors, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has a stent drainage in place for cholangitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of septic shock: The patient's condition is refractory, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Development of ARDS: The patient is receiving low tidal volume ventilation, which may help minimize the risk of ARDS, but there is still a risk of developing this complication.
3. Malignancy progression: The patient has widespread adenopathy and diffuse high-grade malignancy, which may continue to progress and worsen her condition.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac strain, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate kidney injury or failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
7. Infection: The patient has sepsis, which may lead to further infections if not managed properly.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which may lead to deficiencies and further complications.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's condition and prognosis may cause significant psychological distress for the patient and her family."
