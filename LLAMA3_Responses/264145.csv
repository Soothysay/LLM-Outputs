You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe injuries from an artic sun accident. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, dopamine infusion, and other medications. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, and ventricular fibrillation. He has undergone multiple surgical procedures and is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been cultured for blood, urine, and sputum, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for stress ulcer, which may indicate the risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Anoxic brain damage: The patient has suffered anoxic brain damage, which may lead to long-term cognitive and motor impairments.
6. Ventricular fibrillation: The patient is experiencing ventricular fibrillation, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires immediate attention.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be a sign of underlying hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction.
8. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may be due to respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, or pulmonary edema.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers, infections, and other complications.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's impaired gut function and stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding."

   24 Hour Events:
   Went into wenckebach rhythm. A-lined and BP correlating with cuff
   pressures.  Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  EEG done. Pt
   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Went into wenckebach rhythm. A-lined and BP correlating with cuff
   pressures.  Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  EEG done. Pt
   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, was admitted to the CCU following PEA arrest and resuscitation. He was intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FIO2 of 80%. His head CT scan showed diffuse anoxic brain injury, and his EEG was flat lining.

The patient experienced a Wenckebach rhythm, and his blood pressure correlated with cuff pressures. He bradied and went into PEA arrest, which was treated with CPR. After atropine and epinephrine administration, the patient came out of arrest and was in sinus tachycardia with a blood pressure of 220s.

The patient's respiratory support included an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His SpO2 was 100%, and his ABG showed a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 298, and PaCO2 of 42.

The patient's physical examination revealed an intubated and unresponsive patient with no posturing noted, fixed and dilated pupils, and decreased bowel sounds. His vital signs included a temperature of 34°C, blood pressure of 107/81 mmHg, heart rate of 150 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 8.1, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. His troponin-T was 0.29 ng/mL, and his lactic acid level was 2.2 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan included hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, and ventricular fibrillation. His treatment plan included:

1. Cooling protocol for anoxic brain injury
2. Amiodarone and lidocaine discontinuation
3. Monitoring of coagulation profile
4. Serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes
5. Weaning of FIO2 as tolerated
6. Administration of vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
7. CTA without PE, awaiting final read
8. Low-dose fentanyl and versed for possible locked-in state
9. Neurology consult in the morning
10. 48-hour EEG
11. Monitoring of lactate levels
12. Trending of transaminitis
13. Monitoring of blood pressure and urine output
14. Urinary retention management
15. Nutrition management, including NPO, NGT, and possible tube feeds

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive cerebral edema
2. Worsening anoxic brain damage
3. Pneumonia or pneumonitis
4. Pulmonary embolism
5. Hypotension and autonomic instability
6. Lactic acidosis
7. Transaminitis
8. Hypoxemia
9. Ventricular fibrillation
10. Urinary retention and catheter-related complications

These complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize their impact on the patient's condition."

   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and

   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I have summarized the key information and identified potential medical complications that may arise:

**Summary:**

The patient, an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, was admitted to the CCU following PEA arrest and resuscitation. He has a diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan, and his vital signs are unstable. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a FIO2 of 60%. His lactate levels are trending down, but he remains hypotensive and has a history of autonomic instability. He has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

**Potential Complications:**

1. **Progressive Cerebral Edema:** The patient's head CT shows worsening cerebral edema, which may lead to further decline in his neurological status and increased intracranial pressure.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient has bilateral infiltrates on his chest CT, which may progress to pneumonia, particularly given his history of aspiration.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient's elevated lactate levels and suspected aspiration pneumonia increase his risk of developing sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
4. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.
5. **Renal Failure:** The patient's history of autonomic instability and hypotension may increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's chronic indwelling foley catheter and history of autonomic instability may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. **Respiratory Complications:** The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and his FIO2 requirements are high. He may develop respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, or require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to further neurological decline, including seizures, brain edema, or cerebral herniation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely.
2. Adjust his mechanical ventilation settings as needed to maintain optimal oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Consider starting enteral nutrition and monitoring his glycemic control.
4. Continue to monitor his lactate levels and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
5. Consult with neurology and cardiology services to optimize his care.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and cardiac complications, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
7. Consider starting prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
8. Monitor his gastrointestinal and renal function closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected
   to be related to progressive cerebral edema.
   -Head CT concerning for smaller ventricular size, ?worsening cerebral
   edema, no obvious herniation
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state (can likely stop when warmed)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected
   to be related to progressive cerebral edema.
   -Head CT concerning for smaller ventricular size, ?worsening cerebral
   edema, no obvious herniation
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state (can likely stop when warmed)
   - neurology consult in the am
   -48 hour EEG (showing flat line)

   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.

   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   -monitor trend

   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe

   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures who was admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. The patient has diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan and is on an Arctic sun cooling protocol.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening cerebral edema: The patient's head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared to the morning head CT, suggesting progression of cerebral edema. This may lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia. This may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's chest CT shows a small area in the left lower lobe subsegmental branch that could be consistent with a pulmonary embolism. This may lead to respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of autonomic instability and labile blood pressures, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may lead to organ hypoperfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Lactic acidosis: The patient has a lactic acidosis, which may be related to the prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion. This may lead to metabolic acidosis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to the ischemic insult. This may lead to liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Urinary retention: The patient has a chronic indwelling foley catheter, which may lead to urinary retention and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he requires mechanical ventilation. This may lead to respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent or treat them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU after a prolonged PEA arrest and resuscitation. He has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a PaO2 of 298 mmHg on 100% FiO2. He has evidence of anoxic brain injury, with a head CT showing global anoxic injury likely due to prolonged PEA arrest. The patient has also been diagnosed with lactic acidosis, transaminitis, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and the presence of an endotracheal tube, there is a high risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged PEA arrest and subsequent resuscitation may have led to systemic inflammation, which could progress to sepsis.
3. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to long-term cognitive and neurological deficits.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be a sign of liver injury, which could progress to liver failure.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Urinary retention: The patient's chronic indwelling foley catheter may lead to urinary retention, which could worsen if not properly managed.
8. DVT: The patient's prolonged immobility and history of autonomic instability may increase the risk of developing DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged intubation and critical illness may lead to stress ulcer formation, which could worsen if not properly managed.
10. Pneumonia: The patient's new left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray may be a sign of pneumonia, which could worsen if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   o telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -blood, sputum, urine cultures pending
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient with PaO2 in the 90's on 100%FIO2.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -will start abx if concern for pneumonia vs pneumonitis
   -consider CTA to eval for PE if remains hypoxic without clear cause
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unkown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state even though
   - neurology consult in the am
   -48 hour EEG
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   -monitor trend
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, no evidence of

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

1. Cardiac:
	* Went into Wenckebach rhythm, then PEA arrest, which was treated with CPR, atropine, and epi.
	* Currently in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd-degree heart block type I.
	* Echocardiogram on admission showed hyperdynamic LV with no evidence of wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
	* Cardiac enzymes slightly elevated, expected in the setting of several DCCV.
2. Respiratory:
	* Requiring high FIO2 (80%) and mechanical ventilation.
	* Chest CT shows bilateral infiltrates, possibly consistent with aspiration pneumonia, with no pulmonary embolism.
3. Neurological:
	* Head CT shows diffuse anoxic brain injury, likely due to prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
	* EEG ordered, with plans for 48-hour EEG.
4. Renal:
	* Lactic acidosis, likely due to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion, trending down now that HD is stable.
	* Monitor serial lactates.
5. Hemodynamic:
	* Hypotension (not shock), likely due to anoxic injury, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures.
	* On dopamine to maintain MAP >60.
6. Other:
	* Anoxic brain injury with possible locked-in state.
	* Cooling protocol initiated.
	* Blood, sputum, and urine cultures pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia or pneumonitis due to aspiration event.
2. Pulmonary embolism, despite no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or stress ulcer due to prolonged immobility.
5. Further decline in cardiac function or cardiac arrest.
6. Progression of anoxic brain injury, leading to potential locked-in state or death.
7. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to potential infection.
8. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and fluid administration.
9. Further compromise of renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or failure.
10. Development of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction, due to prolonged intubation and immobility."

   24 Hour Events:
   Went into wenckebach rhythm. A-lined and BP correlating with cuff
   pressures.  Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  EEG done. Pt
   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Went into wenckebach rhythm. A-lined and BP correlating with cuff
   pressures.  Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  EEG done. Pt
   with high FIO2 requirements (80%).  Lactate trending down.
   At [**2168**] hrs, pt brady'ed and went into PEA arrest --> CPR started,
   given atropine x 1, epi x 1, came out of arrest into sinus tach, BP
   220s after 3-4 mins of PEA arrest.
   Called by neuro fellow, stating that pt may be in non-convulsive
   status.  Explained that pt was just PEA arrested, and was given CPR.
   Told that pt
s EEG is flat lining.
   Head CT and CTA ordered to look for worsening cerebreal edema, ?PE.
   Head CT shows ventricles are slightly smaller in size compared with the
   morning head ct suggesting progression of cerebral edema, although lot
   of artifact on study from MRI leads.  Chest CT shows bilateral
   infiltrates could be c/w aspiration pneumonia, no pulmonary embolus
   although one small area in the LLL subsegmental branch that could be
   c/w PE.  He was started on vanc/zosyn to cover for aspiration
   pneumonia.  In addition, one set of blood cultures returned with both
   bottles with GPC's in pairs, second set with no growth thus far.

   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent resuscitation. He has a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. The patient's 24-hour course is marked by several significant events, including:

1. Went into Wenckebach rhythm, with a-lined and BP correlating with cuff pressures.
2. Head CT showing diffuse anoxic brain injury.
3. EEG done, with the patient showing high FIO2 requirements (80%).
4. Lactate trending down.
5. At 2168 hours, the patient bradied and went into PEA arrest, requiring CPR. He was given atropine and epinephrine, and came out of arrest into sinus tachycardia with a BP of 220s.
6. The patient's EEG is flatlining.
7. Head CT and CTA were ordered to look for worsening cerebral edema and potential pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Chest CT shows bilateral infiltrates, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia, with no evidence of PE.
9. The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for aspiration pneumonia.
10. Blood cultures were taken, with one set showing growth of GPCs in pairs, and the second set showing no growth.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive cerebral edema: The patient's head CT shows worsening cerebral edema, which could lead to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows bilateral infiltrates, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CTA did not show evidence of PE, the patient's bilateral infiltrates could be consistent with PE, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are trending down, but could still lead to metabolic acidosis and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Hypotension: The patient's BP is labile and could lead to hypoperfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Autonomic instability: The patient's history of autonomic instability could lead to labile BP and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's diffuse anoxic brain injury could lead to long-term neurological deficits and potential brain death.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue cooling protocol to manage cerebral edema.
2. Monitor lactate levels and trend.
3. Continue dopamine to maintain MAP >60.
4. Monitor urine output.
5. Start vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.
6. Obtain serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes to monitor for cardiac ischemia.
7. Consider starting tube feeds in the morning.
8. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and sepsis.
9. Consider obtaining a pulmonary embolism CT scan to rule out PE.
10. Monitor for signs of neurological deterioration and potential brain death."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical issues. They have been on invasive ventilation since 09:39 AM on [**2177-9-21**]. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. They have been receiving dopamine and heparin infusions for blood pressure and anticoagulation control, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. Their liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, are elevated. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, anoxic brain damage, and ventricular fibrillation. The ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of invasive ventilation, arterial line, and blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation and atrial fibrillation increases their risk of cardiac arrest, which can be fatal.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's requirement for invasive ventilation and the presence of respiratory acidosis (pH 7.41, PaCO2 42 mmHg) indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory arrest.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of hypertension increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and history of hyperlipidemia increase their risk of developing liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy and bleeding.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of anoxic brain damage and atrial fibrillation increase their risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected
   to be related to progressive cerebral edema.
   -Head CT concerning for smaller ventricular size, ?worsening cerebral
   edema, no obvious herniation
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state (can likely stop when warmed)
   - neurology consult in the am
   -48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down, currently 2.2
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   -monitor trend
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.

   There is indecisiveness among family members about his code status, but
   the decision was made yesterday to make the patient DNR/DNI.  The
   family would like another family meeting today to update them on any
   progress in order to make any further decisions about proceeding with
   de-escalation of care.  Neuro says to continue 72 hours of EEG
   monitoring, but have little hope for any functional recovery.  Blood
   pressure labile, especially after patient is moved in bed-> fluctuated
   from 50s-60s systolic to 200s in matter of minutes.

   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -PEA arrested overnight again, with unclear precipitant, but suspected
   to be related to progressive cerebral edema.
   -Head CT concerning for smaller ventricular size, ?worsening cerebral
   edema, no obvious herniation

   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's

   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, was admitted to the ICU following a prolonged PEA arrest and resuscitation. He is currently intubated and on a dopamine infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient has a diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT scan and is on an Arctic sun cooling protocol. He has a lactic acidosis, likely due to the prolonged PEA arrest, and is being monitored for serial lactates.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Fibrillation (VF): Given the patient's history of PEA arrest and anoxic brain injury, there is a risk of VF, especially if the patient's cardiac enzymes continue to trend upwards.
2. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure, likely exacerbated by the anoxic brain injury, may lead to hypotension, which could further compromise his cardiac function.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's ongoing hypoxemia, despite being on a high FiO2, may lead to further tissue damage and potentially worsen his anoxic brain injury.
4. Pneumonia/Pneumonitis: The patient's left-sided infiltrate and air bronchograms on CXR suggest a possible aspiration event, which may lead to pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's prolonged PEA arrest and anoxic brain injury, there is a risk of sepsis, especially if the patient develops a secondary infection.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing mechanical ventilation and possible aspiration event may lead to respiratory failure, especially if his lung function continues to decline.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic indwelling foley catheter and possible aspiration event may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing hypotension and potential sepsis may lead to renal failure, especially if his urine output continues to decline.
9. Metabolic Complications: The patient's lactic acidosis and possible anoxic brain injury may lead to metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
10. Neurological Complications: The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or locked-in syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are identified:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's PaO2 is improving with FiO2 of 60, but the etiology of hypoxia is unclear. Aspiration event and pulmonary embolus are considered, but no evidence of right heart strain or PE on CTA.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem reflexes). Cooling protocol was completed, and now the patient is rewarmed.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis likely due to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion. Lactate levels are trending down now that hemodynamics are stable.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis likely due to ischemic insult, which is trending downward.
5. Hypotension/Autonomic Instability: The patient has a history of labile blood pressure and severe orthostasis, which is likely contributing to the current labile BP. Midodrine is being continued four times daily, and dopamine is being used to maintain MAP >60.
6. Urinary Retention: The patient has a chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and urine culture is pending.
7. Pneumonia/Pneumonitis: The patient has a new left-sided infiltrate on CXR, and vancomycin and Zosyn have been started for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
8. Neurological Status: The patient is intubated, unresponsive to any stimulus, and has no brainstem reflexes. EEG monitoring is ongoing, and neurology input is being appreciated.
9. Cardiovascular Status: The patient has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. Echocardiogram on admission showed hyperdynamic LV in the setting of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses. No evidence of wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
10. Respiratory Support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's condition is deteriorating, and the family is considering terminal extubation. The patient's DNR/DNI status and the family's desire to avoid prolonging life in this condition are being respected."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output

   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. The patient has been diagnosed with diffuse anoxic brain injury, likely due to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological: The patient is intubated and unresponsive to any stimulus, with no brainstem reflexes. The EEG is flat, indicating a poor prognosis.
* Cardiac: The patient has no evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall motion abnormality on echo, and no evidence of pericardial effusion or pneumothorax.
* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is labile, fluctuating from 50s-60s systolic to 200s in minutes.
* Laboratory: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, lactic acidosis, and transaminitis, likely due to the ischemic insult.
* Other: The patient has a chronic indwelling foley catheter, is NPO, and has a NGT in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Sepsis: The patient has pneumonia and is at risk of developing sepsis.
* Autonomic instability: The patient's autonomic instability can lead to further labile blood pressure and orthostasis.
* Urinary retention: The patient's chronic indwelling foley catheter may lead to urinary retention.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NGT in place may lead to gastrointestinal complications.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is already poor, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.

The patient's family is discussing goals of care and possible terminal extubation, as the patient would not want to live in this condition. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry

   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE

   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward

   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe

   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Neuro says to continue 72 hours of EEG monitoring, but have little
   hope for any functional recovery.
   - Blood pressure labile, especially after patient is moved in bed->
   fluctuated from 50s-60s systolic to 200s in matter of minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU after a prolonged PEA arrest and resuscitation. He has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures. The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, as evidenced by a flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan.
2. Hypoxemia, likely caused by aspiration or pulmonary embolism, with a significant arterial-alveolar (AA) gradient.
3. Hypotension, which is labile and requires continuous monitoring and treatment with dopamine.
4. Lactic acidosis, likely caused by prolonged hypoperfusion during the PEA arrest.
5. Transaminitis, likely caused by an ischemic insult.
6. Urinary retention, managed with a chronic indwelling foley catheter.
7. Chronic indwelling foley catheter, with a history of urinary retention.
8. Presence of a large cataract in the left eye and post-surgical right pupil.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Heart rate: 86 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Temperature: not reported

The patient is receiving various medications, including dopamine, heparin, famotidine, and vancomycin, and is being monitored for potential complications, such as VAP and DVT.

The patient's condition is being managed with the following interventions:

1. Arctic sun cooling protocol, completed and now re-warmed.
2. Dopamine infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
3. Heparin prophylaxis for DVT.
4. Stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine.
5. VAP prevention with mouth care.
6. Monitoring for potential complications, such as VAP and DVT.

The patient's family is being updated on his condition and is discussing goals of care, including possible terminal extubation, as the patient would not want to live in his current state. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 48 hour EEG (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, NGT in place, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Dispo: DNR/DNI, wife has living will and is HCP, discussing goals of
   care and possible terminal extubation, as pt would not want to live
   like this, per family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible
   terminal extubation
   -off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac

   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as

   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation.
* He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PaO2 of 193 and FiO2 of 60%.
* The patient has a diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, as evident from the flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT head scan.
* He has labile blood pressure, especially after being moved in bed, and is on dopamine to maintain a MAP >60.
* The patient has chronic indwelling foley catheter and is awaiting urine culture.
* He is NPO with a NGT in place and has a pending blood culture.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* **Aspiration Pneumonia:** Given the patient's history of labile blood pressures and possible aspiration event, there is a high risk of aspiration pneumonia, which is already evident from the CXR showing L-sided effusion, bilateral atelectasis, and superimposed infiltrates.
* **Pneumonia vs. Pneumonitis:** The patient is on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis, which is a concern given the patient's immunocompromised state.
* **Lactic Acidosis:** The patient has a history of lactic acidosis, likely due to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion, which may worsen if not monitored and managed appropriately.
* **Hypoxia:** The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration or pneumonia, which may require further management, including weaning of FiO2 as tolerated.
* **Autonomic Instability:** The patient's history of labile blood pressures and severe orthostasis may lead to further autonomic instability, requiring close monitoring and management.
* **Urinary Retention:** The patient's chronic indwelling foley catheter and history of urinary retention may lead to further complications, including UTI and kidney damage.
* **Terminal Extubation:** Given the patient's poor prognosis and DNR/DNI status, terminal extubation may be considered, which requires careful discussion with the family and healthcare team.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate levels.
* Maintain the patient on dopamine to maintain a MAP >60.
* Monitor the patient's urine output and consider replacing the chronic indwelling foley catheter with a new one.
* Discuss the patient's goals of care and possible terminal extubation with the family and healthcare team.
* Consider weaning the patient off FiO2 as tolerated.
* Continue antibiotics for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis and monitor for signs of infection.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and neurological signs of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   PEA arrest and resuscitation, now on Arctic sun protocol with diffuse
   anoxic brain injury on CT scan.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family meeting with neuro this AM regarding possible

   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. He has a poor prognosis due to diffuse anoxic brain injury, with a flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT head scan. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a PaO2 improving with an FIO2 of 60.

The patient has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, which may be contributing to his current hypotension and autonomic instability. He is also at risk for hypoxemia due to the anoxic brain injury and possible aspiration event.

The patient's lab results show elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to the DCCV, and a lactic acidosis, which is trending down now that his hemodynamic status is stable. His transaminitis is also trending downward, likely due to the ischemic insult.

The patient's medications include dopamine to maintain a MAP >60, midodrine four times daily to manage his labile blood pressures, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. He is also receiving vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.

The patient's physical examination shows diffuse anoxic brain injury, with poor prognosis, and a flat EEG. His pupils are fixed and dilated at 6mm bilaterally, and his right pupil appears to be post-surgical. He has a large cataract in his left eye and is unable to assess for tenderness due to his mental status.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemia: due to the anoxic brain injury and possible aspiration event.
2. Hypotension: due to the autonomic instability and possible sepsis.
3. Anoxic brain injury: with a poor prognosis and potential for further neurological decline.
4. Pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: due to the possible aspiration event and LLL opacity on CXR.
5. Lactic acidosis: due to the prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion.
6. Transaminitis: due to the ischemic insult.
7. Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability: due to the patient's history of labile BP and severe orthostasis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue dopamine to maintain a MAP >60.
2. Wean FIO2 as tolerated.
3. Monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal.
4. Continue midodrine four times daily to manage labile blood pressures.
5. Monitor urine output.
6. Discuss goals of care and possible terminal extubation with the family.
7. Consider CMO and possible terminal extubation, as the patient would not want to live like this."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis but will
   d/c as we are moving to CMO
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and who was admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. He has anoxic brain injury, worsening cerebral edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, and no brainstem reflexes.

The patient remains intubated and on ventilator support. The family is awaiting other members to arrive before making a final decision regarding transition to comfort measures only (CMO) and terminal extubation.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis: The patient's brain death is suspected, and the family is considering terminal extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is receiving dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has a significant oxygen gradient, and his PaO2 is improving with an FIO2 of 60.
4. Pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: The patient has a left lower lobe opacity and air bronchograms on CXR, which may indicate aspiration or pneumonia.
5. Lactic acidosis: The patient has a prolonged PEA arrest, which may have contributed to his lactic acidosis.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to an ischemic insult.
7. Urinary retention: The patient has a chronic indwelling foley catheter, and his urine output is being monitored.

The patient's medications include:

1. Dopamine: to maintain MAP of 60
2. Vancomycin and Zosyn: for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
3. Midodrine: to manage labile blood pressure
4. Fentanyl and Versed: to manage pain and sedation
5. Heparin: for prophylaxis against DVT

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated white blood cell count
2. Elevated lactate levels
3. Elevated liver enzymes
4. Elevated troponin levels
5. Anemia

The patient's imaging studies show:

1. CT scan of the head: showing worsening cerebral edema
2. Echo: showing hyperdynamic LV and no evidence of wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions
3. CTA: showing no evidence of pulmonary embolism

The patient's plan is to continue to monitor his condition and adjust his medications as needed. The family is being educated on the patient's condition and the potential for terminal extubation. The patient's case is being reviewed by the organ procurement organization, and they will be notified of the patient's status."

 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - pt remains intubated, on vent, since family awaiting other members to
   arrive before making final decision re: transition to CMO.
   - neuro evaluated patient and assessment is brain death based on EEG,
   physical exam.
   - apnea test has not been performed, as family seems to be trending
   toward terminal extubation and declining at this time
   - [**Location (un) **] organ bank called to notify about patients status; they
   closed the case as pt has not had formal apnea testing done.  Stating
   that pt needs to have all formal testing completed prior to their
   speaking with pt re: organ donation.

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation (vent) due to severe anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral edema. He is in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd-degree heart block type I on telemetry. The patient has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and was admitted to the ICU following a prolonged PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis, as evident from the flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan.
2. Hypotension, likely due to autonomic instability, which is being managed with dopamine and midodrine.
3. Hypoxemia, which is being treated with oxygen therapy.
4. Impaired skin integrity, likely due to prolonged bed rest and anoxic injury.
5. Ventricular fibrillation (VF), which has been treated with amiodarone and lidocaine.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Lactic acidosis, likely due to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion.
2. Transaminitis, likely due to ischemic insult.
3. Hypocalcemia, likely due to anoxic injury.
4. Hyperphosphatemia, likely due to anoxic injury.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Dopamine
2. Midodrine

The patient's family is awaiting other members to arrive before making a final decision regarding transition to comfort measures only (CMO) or terminal extubation. The organ bank has been notified, but the patient's brain death has not been formally declared due to the lack of formal apnea testing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's prolonged hospitalization, immunosuppression, and the presence of a urinary catheter, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's prolonged immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter increase the risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
3. Wound complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of autonomic instability and anoxic brain injury increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral edema increase the risk of developing respiratory failure, which may require further mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further discussion with the family regarding the patient's goals of care and potential terminal extubation is necessary."

   24 Hour Events:
   - pt remains intubated, on vent, since family awaiting other members to
   arrive before making final decision re: transition to CMO.
   - neuro evaluated patient and assessment is brain death based on EEG,
   physical exam.
   - apnea test has not been performed, as family seems to be trending
   toward terminal extubation and declining at this time
   - [**Location (un) **] organ bank called to notify about patients status; they
   closed the case as pt has not had formal apnea testing done.  Stating
   that pt needs to have all formal testing completed prior to their

 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis but will
   d/c as we are moving to CMO
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, remains intubated and on ventilator support in the ICU. He was admitted following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration, and has since developed anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis. His brain death was evaluated by neurology, and the patient is currently being considered for CMO (Cardiac Massage Only) or terminal extubation. The family is waiting for other members to arrive before making a final decision.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia and has undergone an Arctic sun cooling protocol, which has been completed. He is currently being weaned off sedation and is off amiodarone gtt. His condition is complicated by hypoxemia, anoxic brain injury, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and anoxic brain injury increase his risk for developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of autonomic instability and the use of dopamine to maintain blood pressure increase his risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's anoxic brain injury and impaired skin integrity increase his risk for developing respiratory failure.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's anoxic brain injury and poor prognosis increase his risk for neurological deterioration.
6. Infection: The patient's prolonged intubation and use of invasive lines increase his risk for developing infections.
7. Bloodstream infection: The patient's use of central lines and the risk of VAP increase his risk for developing bloodstream infections.
8. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's anoxic brain injury, impaired skin integrity, and other complications increase his risk for developing multi-organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider weaning the patient off dopamine and other medications that may be contributing to his cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning him off the ventilator if possible.
4. Consider antibiotics for the patient's pneumonia and monitor his response closely.
5. Continue to provide supportive care, including glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Consult with the patient's family and healthcare proxy to discuss his goals of care and potential terminal extubation.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a hospice or palliative care unit if his condition worsens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE

   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis but will
   d/c as we are moving to CMO
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. He has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury, cerebral edema, and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan. His brainstem reflexes are absent, and he has no spontaneous breathing. The patient's family is waiting for other members to arrive before making a final decision regarding CMO and terminal extubation.

The patient has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and is on numerous medications, including midodrine, salt tabs, and dopamine. He has a chronic indwelling foley catheter and is NPO with a NGT in place. His blood pressure is labile, and he has been diagnosed with lactic acidosis, likely secondary to prolonged PEA arrest and hypoperfusion.

The patient's labs show evidence of anoxic brain injury, including a flat EEG and worsening cerebral edema on CT scan. His cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, and he has a hyperdynamic left ventricle on echocardiogram. He has a significant AA gradient and is on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia or pneumonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for respiratory failure, especially if he is extubated.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is at risk for cardiovascular instability, especially if his dopamine infusion is discontinued.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's anoxic brain injury is likely to worsen, and he is at risk for neurological deterioration, including decreased consciousness and increased intracranial pressure.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia or pneumonitis, and he is at risk for developing sepsis.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT, especially given his prolonged immobility and history of autonomic instability.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers, especially given his immobility and decreased sensation.
7. Kidney injury: The patient has a history of autonomic instability and is at risk for developing kidney injury, especially given his prolonged hypoperfusion.
8. Liver injury: The patient has a history of autonomic instability and is at risk for developing liver injury, especially given his prolonged hypoperfusion.
9. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of autonomic instability and is at risk for developing pancreatitis, especially given his prolonged hypoperfusion.
10. GI bleeding: The patient is at risk for developing GI bleeding, especially given his prolonged hypoperfusion and history of autonomic instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient remains intubated and on ventilator support in the ICU. The patient's neurological status has deteriorated, and a neuro evaluation has confirmed brain death. The family is trending toward terminal extubation, and apnea testing has not been performed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/75 mmHg. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia (Hct 37.9%), thrombocytopenia (Plt 128 K/uL), and liver dysfunction (ALT 145 IU/L, AST 139 IU/L). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level (Ca++ 8.3 mg/dL).

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, soft and tender to palpation, and positive bowel sounds. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and there is evidence of anoxic brain damage.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and presence of central lines, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if the ventilator is discontinued.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and the presence of dopamine infusion increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's distended abdomen and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's impaired immune function and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing infections.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Renal failure: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver dysfunction increase the risk of developing renal failure.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and on ventilator support in the ICU. The patient's family is awaiting other members to arrive before making a decision regarding transition to comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's neuro status has been evaluated, and the assessment is brain death based on EEG and physical exam. The apnea test has not been performed due to the family's trend toward terminal extubation. The patient has been receiving various medications, including dopamine, heparin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Vital signs:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (69-115 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/75 mmHg (87-203/120 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Weight: 76.2 kg (admission weight: 76.5 kg)

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and potential coagulopathy.
3. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and potential medication side effects.
4. Anoxic brain damage or encephalopathy due to prolonged hypoxia and potential brain death.
5. Hypotension or shock due to fluid imbalance, medication side effects, or underlying cardiac or circulatory issues.
6. Impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility and potential pressure ulcers.
7. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) or other cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalance, medication side effects, or underlying cardiac issues.

Given the patient's critical condition and potential for further complications, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -CE
s trending downward
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates, trending down and now normal
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-17**] ischemic insult
   - trending downward
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, await urine cx.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, NGT in place, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Dispo: DNR/DNI, wife has living will and is HCP, discussing goals of
   care and possible terminal extubation, as pt would not want to live
   like this, per family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9957**] is an 80 y/o male with parkinsonism,
   autonomic instability, who was admitted to CCU following PEA arrest,
   likely secondary to aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed
   and off sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral
   edema on CT scan, flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
   spontaneous breathing.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   - diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head
   showing worsening cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem
   reflexes)
   - completed Arctic sun cooling protocol, now re-warmed
   - now DNR/DNI, family waiting for other members before making final
   decision re: CMO/terminal extubation
   - off amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   - monitor on telemetry
   - [**Location (un) **] Organ bank notified of patient; they closed the case
   stating that the patient needs to have all formal testing completed
   prior to their speaking with patient.  Unclear if this is actually the
   case, after reviewing our brain death policy.
   - will need to speak with family re: CMO status, apnea testing (which
   they have deferred up to this point), and terminal extubation, since
   the family states that the patient would not want to live like this.
   - can be formally declared brain dead, if does not pass apnea test
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.

   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -started vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia vs. pneumonitis
   -CTA without PE, but awaiting final read
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-17**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown duration.
   -cooling protocol completed, now re-warmed, with unchanged exam
   -off fentanyl/versed with no brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as
   per neuro
   - appreciate neurology care/input
   - 72 hour EEG completed (showing flat line as per neuro)
   - No corneal reflex this AM.  Low likelihood of regaining cortical
   function.

   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-17**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.

   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest, likely secondary to aspiration. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition is deteriorating, with worsening cerebral edema and anoxic brain injury. His brain death assessment is based on EEG and physical exam, and apnea testing has not been performed. The family is trending towards terminal extubation and declining further treatment.

The patient has a history of parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and hypotension. He has been treated with dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. His blood pressure is currently 107/75 mmHg.

The patient has a left-sided infiltrate on his chest X-ray, which is likely due to pneumonia or pneumonitis. He has been started on vancomycin and Zosyn for treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin and CK levels, indicating possible myocardial damage. His lactate levels are trending down, but he has a history of labile blood pressure and autonomic instability.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mmol/L and a magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL. His albumin level is 3.5 g/dL, and his calcium level is 8.3 mg/dL.

The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and his urine output is being monitored. He is NPO and has a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his family is discussing goals of care and possible terminal extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a left-sided infiltrate on his chest X-ray, which could lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status is deteriorating. He may require further respiratory support or intubation.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of PEA arrest and autonomic instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
4. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's anoxic brain injury is likely irreversible, and he may not regain cortical function.
5. Lactic acidosis: The patient has a history of lactic acidosis, which could worsen if not properly managed.
6. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which could worsen if not properly managed.
7. Autonomic instability: The patient has a history of autonomic instability, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and further management is required to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-17**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   on telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.

   AA gradient, but PaO2 improving with FIO2 of 60.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-17**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of Parkinsonism, autonomic instability, and labile blood pressures, who was admitted to the ICU following a PEA arrest and resuscitation. He is currently intubated and on a ventilator, and has been diagnosed with diffuse anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, hypoxemia, and impaired skin integrity. He has also developed anoxic brain damage, ventricular fibrillation, and lactic acidosis, likely due to the prolonged PEA arrest.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting possible cardiac injury. His echocardiogram shows hyperdynamic LV function, but no evidence of wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.

The patient's condition is unstable, and he is at risk for further complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation and prolonged PEA arrest increases his risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and impaired lung function increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and suspected pneumonitis increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's lactic acidosis and impaired renal function increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's impaired gut function and chronic indwelling foley catheter increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications.

The patient's family is being informed of his poor prognosis and the possibility of terminal extubation. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is to be discussed with his wife, who is also his healthcare proxy.

In terms of treatment, the patient is currently receiving dopamine to maintain his blood pressure, and his antibiotics have been adjusted to include vancomycin and Zosyn. His cooling protocol has been completed, and he is now being rewarmed. His electrolytes are being monitored, and his lactate levels are trending down. His transaminitis is also trending downward, and his blood pressure is being managed with midodrine and dopamine.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is poor. Further complications are likely, and his family should be prepared for the possibility of terminal extubation."
