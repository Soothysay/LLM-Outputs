   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology recs regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen

   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1 on admission. Resolved to 11.2 this morning.
   Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from last hospitalization was
   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.
   From looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and
   was going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, who presented with weakness, dysarthria, and left-sided numbness, which have since resolved. The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with several ongoing medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with no residual deficits. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which has resolved, and elevated troponin levels, which are likely related to the patient's cardiac condition.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed closely. These include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of skin breakdown, which can lead to infection and further complications.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of TIAs and is taking Aggrenox, which may increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but it needs to be closely monitored.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia, which may be related to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's oxygen saturation is currently normal, but it needs to be closely monitored.
4. Gait disorder: The patient has a known pubic rami fracture and has recently slipped from her bed at rehab. The patient needs to be closely monitored for falls and needs to be instructed on fall precautions.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to infection or inflammation. The patient needs to be closely monitored for signs of infection or inflammation.
6. Meningitis or encephalitis: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status raise concerns for meningitis or encephalitis. The patient needs to be closely monitored for signs of infection or inflammation in the central nervous system.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue Aggrenox per outpatient regimen.
2. Follow up with neurology regarding recurring TIA while on Aggrenox.
3. Consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG.
4. Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone until further neurology evaluation.
5. Continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen.
6. Follow up TSH, Vit B12.
7. Restart lisinopril 40mg po daily, per outpatient regimen.
8. Continue blood cultures, UA, urine culture.
9. Continue Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia.
10. Supplemental oxygen as needed.
11. Rule out MI.
12. Speak with ortho regarding weight bearing.
13. Fall precautions.
14. PT consult.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her ongoing medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology recs regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen

   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.
   From looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and
   was going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].

* Chronic leukocytosis
* Pubic rami fracture
* Depression

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Follow-up with neurology regarding recurring TIA while on aspirin and clopidogrel
* Consideration of MRI/MRA, echocardiogram, and EEG to rule out patent foramen ovale (PFO)
* Continuation of aspirin and clopidogrel per outpatient regimen
* Restart of lisinopril 40mg per day
* Continuation of vancomycin and ceftriaxone until further neurology evaluation
* Consideration of hematologic workup if culture data is negative
* Follow-up with orthopedics regarding weight-bearing status and fall precautions
* Consult with physical therapy regarding gait disorder and fall prevention
* Continue mirtazapine per outpatient regimen for depression

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Recurring TIA or stroke
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Meningitis or encephalitis
* Chronic leukocytosis or other hematologic disorders
* Gait disorder or fall-related injuries
* Depression or other psychiatric disorders
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers
* Pulmonary embolism or other cardiovascular complications

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness and dysarthria. The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently undergoing treatment for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 200/73 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and is being monitored for fluid balance, with a total input of 1,000 mL and output of 840 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, with a WBC of 11.2 K/uL and platelet count of 283 K/uL. The patient's blood chemistry results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but the patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to the use of insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of pneumonia and elevated WBC count increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Stroke: The patient's current CVA or stroke can worsen, leading to increased risk of mortality and morbidity.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support through a nasal cannula may not be sufficient to meet the patient's oxygen demands, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels indicate cardiac damage, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's use of insulin and blood glucose levels within normal range increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and history of pneumonia increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia increases the risk of developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic regimen to address the possibility of sepsis.
3. Consider performing a head CT scan to assess the extent of the CVA or stroke.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Adjust the patient's insulin regimen to prevent hypoglycemia.
6. Consider ordering prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider performing a fiberoptic bronchoscopy to assess for VAP."

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology in AM regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA in AM
   -Patient has no Echo in our system. Consider Echo in the AM to rule out
   PFO.
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen
   -obtain fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C
   -allow autoregulation of BP with goal SBP < 185
   -labetalol PRN SBP>185
   -hold lisinopril. Consider restarting in the AM.
   -Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone tonight
   -consider EEG in AM
   -continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
   -obtain TSH, Vit B12
   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1. Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from
   last hospitalization was 14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However
   given new hypoxia, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Patient
   reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is possible
   that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though clinically
   patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic elevation.
   Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative. From
   looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and was
   going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   -blood cultures
   -UA, urine culture
   -d/c foley catheter
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
   .
   3. Hypoxia: CTA negative for PE. CT chest does not show infiltrates,
   however given leukocytosis and hypoxia, would strongly consider
   community acquired pneumonia. Influenza swab performed in ED is
   negative. Lactate of 2.3 likely from increased work of breathing. EKG
   unchanged from baseline.
   -Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA pneumonia
   -supplemental oxygen as needed
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -repeat lactate in AM
   -rule out MI -1st set negative
   4. Gait disorder: Patient recently slipped from her bed at rehab.  She
   has a known pubic rami fracture, seen on CT today.  She has seen
   orthopedics as an outpatient.
   -weight bearing as tolerated.
   -fall precautions
   .
   # h/o Depression: continue mirtazapine per outpatient regimen
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now. Consider heart healthy
   diet in the AM if mental status improves.
   # PPX:  heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV x2

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology in AM regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA in AM
   -Patient has no Echo in our system. Consider Echo in the AM to rule out
   PFO.
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen
   -obtain fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C
   -allow autoregulation of BP with goal SBP < 185
   -labetalol PRN SBP>185
   -hold lisinopril. Consider restarting in the AM.
   -Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone tonight
   -consider EEG in AM
   -continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
   -obtain TSH, Vit B12
   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1. Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from
   last hospitalization was 14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However
   given new hypoxia, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Patient
   reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is possible
   that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though clinically
   patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic elevation.
   Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative. From
   looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and was
   going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   -blood cultures
   -UA, urine culture
   -d/c foley catheter
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
   .
   3. Hypoxia: CTA negative for PE. CT chest does not show infiltrates,
   however given leukocytosis and hypoxia, would strongly consider
   community acquired pneumonia. Influenza swab performed in ED is
   negative. Lactate of 2.3 likely from increased work of breathing. EKG
   unchanged from baseline.
   -Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA pneumonia
   -supplemental oxygen as needed
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -repeat lactate in AM
   -rule out MI -1st set negative
   4. Gait disorder: Patient recently slipped from her bed at rehab.  She
   has a known pubic rami fracture, seen on CT today.  She has seen
   orthopedics as an outpatient.
   -weight bearing as tolerated.
   -fall precautions
   .
   # h/o Depression: continue mirtazapine per outpatient regimen

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with weakness, dysarthria, and left-sided numbness, which have since resolved. She has a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and is already on Aggrenox. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 200/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, and her blood cultures are pending. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) is unchanged from baseline.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Follow-up with neurology in the morning regarding recurring TIA while on Aggrenox.
2. Consider MRI/MRA in the morning to rule out a patent foramen ovale (PFO).
3. Continue Aggrenox per outpatient regimen.
4. Obtain a fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C.
5. Allow autoregulation of blood pressure with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 185 mmHg.
6. Hold lisinopril and consider restarting in the morning.
7. Continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia.
8. Consider EEG in the morning.
9. Continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen.
10. Obtain TSH and Vit B12.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Recurring TIA or stroke
* Community-acquired pneumonia
* Meningitis or encephalitis
* Chronic elevation of white blood cell count
* Hypoxia
* Gait disorder
* Fall risk due to pubic rami fracture
* Depression

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: IV fluids and repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Glycemic control: NPO for now
* Lines: 18-gauge and 20-gauge
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a 90+ year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA and transient hypoxemia. She was triaged to the MICU overnight and has had an unremarkable evaluation so far. Her current vital signs are stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination is normal except for bibasilar crackles on lung examination. Her laboratory results show normal hemoglobin and platelet count, but elevated troponin-T and creatinine levels. Her imaging studies, including CT torso and head, show no acute intracranial abnormality and a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrent TIAs: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and recent transient hypoxemia suggest a high risk of recurrent TIAs. Monitoring for signs of recurrent TIAs, such as new neurological symptoms, is crucial.
2. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, which may indicate an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased WBC count, is essential.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may exacerbate her TIAs. Cautious control of BP is necessary to prevent further TIAs.
4. L pubic ramus fracture: The patient's fracture may require orthopedic evaluation and possible surgical intervention.
5. Fall risk: The patient's history of falls and recent fracture suggest a high risk of further falls. Implementing fall precautions, such as bed rails and non-slip socks, is necessary to prevent further falls.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's bibasilar crackles on lung examination may indicate underlying respiratory disease. Monitoring for signs of respiratory compromise, such as decreased oxygen saturation or increased respiratory rate, is necessary.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level suggests possible cardiac complications. Monitoring for signs of cardiac complications, such as chest pain or decreased cardiac output, is necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and promote her recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA and transient hypoxemia. The patient has been triaged to the MICU overnight for further evaluation and management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, and blood pressure of 176/68 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with the exception of a possible TIA.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 283 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.10 ng/mL, and the patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan of the torso and head, show no acute intracranial abnormality, but do show evidence of chronic lung disease and pulmonary nodules. The patient's electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and ST-T wave changes.

The patient's plan includes continued treatment with Aggrenox and statin, as well as further testing, including possible MRI and EEG. The patient's hypertension is being managed with lisinopril, and the patient's pubic ramus fracture is being evaluated by orthopedics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent TIA or stroke: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and transient hypoxemia puts her at risk for further neurological events.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and chronic lung disease make her more susceptible to infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's chronic lung disease and possible pulmonary nodules on imaging studies increase her risk for pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Fall risk: The patient's pubic ramus fracture and history of falls increase her risk for further falls and injury.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology recs regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen

   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1 on admission. Resolved to 11.2 this morning.
   Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from last hospitalization was
   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.
   From looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and
   was going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, who presented to the emergency department with weakness, left-sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria, which have since resolved. The patient was found to have leukocytosis, hypoxia, and a lactate level of 2.3, which is likely due to increased work of breathing. The patient has a known pubic rami fracture and was recently seen by orthopedics as an outpatient. The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with mirtazapine. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurring TIA while on Aggrenox: The patient has a history of multiple TIAs and is already on Aggrenox. The patient's recent symptoms of weakness, numbness, and dysarthria may be a sign of recurring TIA, which is a concerning complication.
2. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and hypoxia, which may be indicative of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Meningitis or encephalitis: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status may be indicative of meningitis or encephalitis. Further evaluation is needed to rule out these complications.
4. Gait disorder: The patient has a known pubic rami fracture and recently slipped from her bed at rehab. The patient may be at risk for further falls and gait disorders, which could lead to complications such as hip fracture or other injuries.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with mirtazapine. The patient's mental status may be affected by her medical condition, and further evaluation is needed to assess her mental health.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status may be indicative of hypothyroidism. Further evaluation is needed to rule out this complication.
7. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status may be indicative of seizures. Further evaluation is needed to rule out this complication.

Recommendations:

1. Follow up with neurology regarding recurring TIA while on Aggrenox.
2. Consider MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out PFO, EEG.
3. Continue Aggrenox per outpatient regimen.
4. Restart lisinopril 40mg po daily, per outpatient regimen.
5. Continue Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia.
6. Consider hematologic workup if culture data negative.
7. Continue mirtazapine per outpatient regimen.
8. Speak with orthopedics regarding weight bearing.
9. Implement fall precautions.
10. Consult physical therapy for gait disorder.
11. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis.
12. Continue heparin SQ and bowel regimen.
13. Consider DVT prophylaxis.
14. Continue VAP prophylaxis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox. She presented with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria, which have since resolved. The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. She also has a pubic rami fracture and is being treated with orthopedic consult. The patient has been experiencing delirium, which is thought to be related to her TIA. She has also been experiencing leukocytosis, which has been attributed to chronic leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and she is being treated with antihypertensive medications. The patient's cardiovascular status needs to be closely monitored to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which has resolved. However, she may be at risk for respiratory complications due to her pneumonia and atelectasis.
3. Neurological: The patient has a history of TIAs and is at risk for further neurological complications. The patient's neurological status needs to be closely monitored, and she should be followed up with neurology consults as recommended.
4. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with CAP and is being treated with antibiotics. However, she may be at risk for further infections, particularly due to her chronic leukocytosis.
5. Orthopedic: The patient has a pubic rami fracture and is being treated with orthopedic consult. She may be at risk for further complications, such as osteomyelitis or non-union of the fracture.
6. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with mirtazapine. She may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting.
7. Hematological: The patient has chronic leukocytosis, which may be a risk factor for bleeding or thrombocytopenia. Her hematological status needs to be closely monitored.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and her care needs to be closely monitored to prevent further complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104**], MD

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA, and triaged to the MICU overnight for transient hypoxemia. The patient has had an unremarkable evaluation so far, but has developed labile blood pressure and delirium, which is new and not attributed to any clear underlying infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 179/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's neurological examination is notable for decreased level of consciousness, with no follow-up commands, and no movement, tone, or reflexes assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 283 K/μL, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.10 ng/mL, and her CK/CKMB and troponin-T levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show a pelvic plain film with a fracture of the inferior ramus of the pubic bone, which is consistent with a recent fall.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Delirium: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection, and antibiotics will be discontinued if the patient remains stable. Haldol will be used as needed to manage the patient's delirium.
2. Possible TIA: The patient will continue to receive Aggrenox and statin therapy, and the neurology team will follow up with the patient.
3. Transient hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, and she is being monitored closely.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure will be cautiously controlled in the setting of TIAs.
5. L pubic ramus fracture: The patient will receive fall precautions, physical therapy, and occupational therapy to manage her fracture.
6. ICU care: The patient will receive nutrition support, and her blood sugar will be closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of delirium, which can lead to increased risk of falls, aspiration, and respiratory failure.
* Recurrence of TIA or stroke, which can lead to permanent neurological damage or death.
* Infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
* Hypertension, which can lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
* Fracture complications, such as nonunion, malunion, or osteomyelitis.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe transfer to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox, admitted with likely recurrent TIA and triaged to the MICU overnight for transient hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 179/54 mmHg to 207/95 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her neurological examination is notable for delirium, with no clear signs of infection at this time.

The patient has been prescribed several medications, including Aggrenox, statin, lisinopril, amlodipine, and Haldol. She has also received antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, which was discontinued yesterday.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 11.2 x 10^9/L. Her hemoglobin level is 11.1 g/dL, and her platelet count is 283 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of public ramus fracture, which was confirmed by pelvic plain films. She has also been diagnosed with delirium, which is being managed with frequent re-orientation and low-dose Haldol as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Recurrent TIA or stroke: The patient's history of TIAs and recent admission with likely recurrent TIA puts her at risk for further neurological events.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and recent antibiotics may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis or organ failure if left untreated.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which could lead to complications such as cardiac failure, renal failure, or cerebral edema if not adequately controlled.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as falls, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
5. Falls: The patient's history of public ramus fracture and delirium puts her at risk for falls, which could lead to further injuries or complications.
6. Wound complications: The patient's public ramus fracture may lead to wound complications, such as infection or delayed healing, if not properly managed.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and history of TIAs put her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as cardiac failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including recurrent TIA or stroke, infection, hypertension, delirium, falls, wound complications, and cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring and management of these risk factors are essential to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's optimal recovery."
