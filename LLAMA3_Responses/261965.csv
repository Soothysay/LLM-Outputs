You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. They have been experiencing episodes of angioedema, likely due to Ativan, which has been treated with Valproate. The patient has also had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has been treated with fentanyl, lopressor, and metoprolol. Their mental status has cleared significantly overnight, and they are now awake and following commands.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. Their laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy may not be sufficient to manage their respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and the use of fentanyl and lopressor may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and the use of Valproate may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as status epilepticus or encephalopathy.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an infection, which could worsen their condition.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney damage or failure, which could worsen their condition.
6. Hepatic failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver damage or failure, which could worsen their condition.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
8. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's use of heparin may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   .
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state/medication effect (ativan, propofol).
   Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were
   negative.   EEG yesterday (prelim) negative for status.   Would hold
   off on using ativan for any recurrent seizure as it may have been
   responsible for her angioedema yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) following a failed kidney transplant, who presented with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS). The patient's mental status has improved, and the episode is likely due to a postictal state/medication effect (ativan, propofol).

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Valproate
* Keppra
* Fentanyl
* Metoprolol
* Heparin
* Lisinopril (held due to association with angioedema)
* Coumadin
* Statin
* RISS (held)
* FSG (held)
* NPO (nothing by mouth)

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Angioedema: may have been caused by ativan administration, and the patient is being monitored for further episodes.
* Hypotension: likely caused by medication effect, and the patient is back on metoprolol.
* ESRD on HD: the patient missed two outpatient HD sessions and is currently receiving daily dialysis.
* Afib on coumadin: the patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and it is unclear if the patient is compliant with home medications.
* HTN: the patient is on metoprolol and lisinopril has been discontinued due to association with angioedema.
* Hyperlipidemia: the patient is continuing to receive a statin.
* DM: the patient is receiving RISS and FSG.
* FEN: the patient is NPO for now.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.6
* Hct: 33.0
* Plt: 430
* Cr: 14.5
* TCO2: 19
* Glucose: 63
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.9 / 103.2 / 1.5, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 513 / /, ALT / AST: 6-4, Alk Phos / T Bili: 48 / 0.3, Amylase / Lipase: 63 /, Differential-Neuts: 60.7 %, Lymph: 29.0 %, Mono: 7.2 %, Eos: 2.9 %, Lactic Acid: 0.6 mmol/L, Albumin: 4.3 g/dL, LDH: 237 IU/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 5.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding ativan and lisinopril
* Continuing keppra and valproate
* Restarting metoprolol for rate control
* Restarting coumadin once extubated
* Daily dialysis to treat uremia
* Renally dosing medications
* Epo at HD
* Steroids x 3 doses for angioedema
* Monitoring for further episodes of angioedema
* Urgent EEG
* Seizure precautions
* Daily HD to treat uremia
* NPO for now
* Sc heparin for prophylaxis
* Replete lytes PRN
* Bowel meds
* Full code
* ICU pending clinical improvement

The patient's family has been notified of her condition, and the patient's brother/HCP has been contacted."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with an acute episode of Altered Mental Status (AMS) and was intubated. She was diagnosed with angioedema possibly due to ativan administration, and her lisinopril was discontinued. She was also diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She was treated with anticonvulsants, and her mental status is now appropriate. She was dialyzed yesterday and will continue with daily dialysis to treat uremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and respiratory failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status could be a sign of underlying neurological damage, and she may be at risk for seizures, cerebral edema, and other neurological complications.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and history of angioedema may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
4. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and need for daily dialysis may increase her risk for acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and other renal complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central venous catheter may increase her risk for infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, and pancreatitis.
7. Endocrine complications: The patient's diabetes and history of hyperlipidemia may increase her risk for endocrine complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and thyroid dysfunction."

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), failed kidney transplant, and recent surgery for benign pneumatosis. She was admitted to the ICU with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have a postictal state coupled with medication effect. Her mental status has since improved. She has a history of angioedema, which may have been caused by ativan administration, and is being treated with steroids. She is also being treated for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: Given the patient's history of seizures and the possible association of ativan with angioedema, there is a risk of seizure recurrence.
2. Angioedema: The patient's history of angioedema and the possible association with ativan and lisinopril administration increases the risk of angioedema.
3. Tracheal stenosis: The patient's history of tracheal stenosis may make it difficult to develop a cuff leak, which could lead to respiratory complications.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of ESRD and HD may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could exacerbate her condition.
5. Infection: The patient's history of ESRD and HD increases the risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ESRD may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and myocardial infarction.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of ESRD and HD may lead to renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and ESRD may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke and peripheral neuropathy.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her and manage her medications carefully to prevent potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 139/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 inspirations per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and amlodipine was resumed at a reduced dose. Valproate was recommended by neurology, but the dose is not specified. The patient has an allergy to Percocet, Motrin, and Aspirin, and has a history of anaphylaxis to Dilantin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (14.5 mg/dL), lactate (0.6 mmol/L), and lipase (63 IU/L). The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, and the platelet count is 322 K/uL.

The patient's medical conditions include acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis. The patient is at risk for developing complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, stress ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and use of vasopressors may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and the use of vasopressors.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly.
5. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate and lipase, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's temperature is also elevated, which may indicate an infection.
6. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Dilantin, and may be at risk for anaphylaxis to other medications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may increase the risk of developing hypertensive complications such as cardiac failure and cerebral edema.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, and is at risk for developing various complications. Close monitoring and prompt management of these complications are necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.
   -- neuro following

   #angioedema- may have been due to ativan administration.   Given
   steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak today.  Has h/o
   ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- depakote [**Hospital1 **], will taper dose per neuro
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   #angioedema- may have been due to ativan administration.   Given
   steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak today.  Has h/o
   ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed 2 outpatient HD sessions. Dialyzed yesterday in
   MICU.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, and a failed kidney transplant.
* She is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and respiratory failure.
* She has persistent apnea, even when awake, which is unclear in etiology.
* She has a history of tracheal stenosis after previous tracheostomy.
* She is on multiple medications, including Keppra, Valproate, and Heparin, and is receiving daily HD to treat uremia.
* She has a history of angioedema and is being monitored for this condition.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory complications:
	+ Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation
	+ Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	+ Tracheal stenosis worsening
* Neurological complications:
	+ Seizures due to medication changes or underlying condition
	+ Altered mental status worsening
* Cardiovascular complications:
	+ Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication changes
	+ Hypertension due to underlying condition or medication changes
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to inadequate dialysis or medication changes
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
* Infectious complications:
	+ Sepsis due to underlying infection or catheter-related infections
	+ Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)
* Gastrointestinal complications:
	+ Gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged intubation or medication changes
	+ Pancreatitis due to medication changes or underlying condition
* Other complications:
	+ Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying condition
	+ Wound infections or dehiscence due to prolonged intubation and immobility

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history and multiple comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with continued periods of apnea when allowed to initiate breaths on their own. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 120 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support (PS) of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating potential sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient's blood chemistry results are also concerning, with elevated levels of potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4), which may require correction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued periods of apnea and elevated respiratory rate (RR) suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and laboratory results suggesting organ dysfunction may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated Cr levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI, which can further complicate the patient's condition.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated K+, Mg++, and PO4 levels may require correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).

Given the patient's complex medical history and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of their condition to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), failed kidney transplant, and recent exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis. She presents with acute mental status changes (AMS) and was found to have a postictal state with medication effect (ativan and propofol).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Altered mental status: likely due to postictal state and medication effect, with a negative head CT and toxicology screen.
2. Angioedema: may be related to ativan administration, with a history of?tracheal stenosis, which may impact cuff leak development.
3. ESRD on HD: missed 2 outpatient HD sessions, with daily dialysis planned to treat uremia.
4. Atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin: INR subtherapeutic, with unclear compliance with home medications.
5. Hypertension (HTN) on metoprolol and amlodipine, with discontinuation of lisinopril due to angioedema association.
6. Hyperlipidemia: continuation of statin therapy.
7. Diabetes mellitus (DM): RISS, FSG qid.
8. Feeding: NPO for now.
9. Access: PIV, with HD cath for emergency, and previous central venous DVT, which may impact central access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Wound complications: due to prolonged stay and potential surgical site infections.
4. Cardiovascular complications: given the patient's history of Afib and HTN, with potential for arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
5. Neurological complications: due to prolonged sedation and potential for seizures.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: due to prolonged NPO status and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Infections: due to prolonged hospitalization and potential for catheter-related infections.
8. Renal complications: due to ongoing ESRD and potential for acute kidney injury.
9. Allergic reactions: due to the patient's history of angioedema and potential for allergic reactions to medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Daily HD to treat uremia.
2. Continuation of keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
3. Hold ativan and lisinopril due to angioedema association.
4. Restart coumadin once extubated.
5. Continue metoprolol and amlodipine for HTN.
6. Restart statin therapy for hyperlipidemia.
7. RISS, FSG qid for DM.
8. NPO status for now.
9. PIV and HD cath access for emergency.
10. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement, with code status set to full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU who was recently extubated and restarted on their home coumadin regimen. They had an episode of hypoglycemia overnight, which was resolved with juice. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/64 mmHg. They are receiving prophylactic heparin and have a midline catheter in place. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's recent episode of hypoglycemia (glucose level of 60) highlights the need for close monitoring of blood glucose levels and prompt treatment of any episodes of hypoglycemia.
2. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and platelet count is essential.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 390 K/uL, which is slightly low. This may increase the risk of bleeding and requires close monitoring.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is 228 mL over the past 24 hours, which may indicate a risk of fluid overload. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and adjustment of fluid administration as needed are essential.
5. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilation settings as needed are essential to prevent respiratory compromise.
6. Infection risk: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and prompt treatment of any suspected infections are essential.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, and they may be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and provision of adequate nutrition as needed are essential.
8. Medication errors: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of medication errors. Close monitoring of the patient's medication regimen and prompt treatment of any medication-related adverse effects are essential.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, admitted with AMS
   likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis, transferred to MICU
   after intubation for airway protection following a seizure +/-
   angioedema secondary to ?ativan.
   1.  Airway.  Patient initially intubated for airway protection in
   post-ictal state +/- angioedema secondary to ?ativan.  Was apneic and
   without cuff leak initially.  Extubated yesterday and doing well now on
   room air.
   2.  AMS.  Admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to
   missing dialysis and opioids at home.  Her mental status now is
   appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative.   EEG (prelim)
   negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- d/c depakote
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   3.  Angioedema.  This  may have been due to ativan administration.
   Given steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak yesterday.  Has
   h/o ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: Dialyzed today.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal
   -- continue nephrocaps and sensipar
   -- renally dose meds
   -- epo at HD
   .
   5.  Afib on coumadin.  Patient admitted with subtherapeutic INR so
   unclear if taking meds at home.
   -- metoprolol for rate control
   -- IV BB prn RVR
   --restarted coumadin yesterday
   - follow PTT
   .
   6.       HTN: on metoprolol and amlodipine. Discontinue lisinopril due
   to association with angioedema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), failed kidney transplant, and a recent exploratory laparotomy for benign pneumatosis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for altered mental status (AMS) likely secondary to missed dialysis and opioids at home.

Current medical conditions and concerns include:

1. Airway: The patient was intubated for airway protection following a seizure and angioedema secondary to?ativan. She was extubated yesterday and is currently doing well on room air.
2. AMS: The patient's mental status is now appropriate, and head CT and tox screens were negative. An EEG (prelim) was negative for status.
3. Angioedema: This may have been due to ativan administration. The patient has a history of tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop a cuff leak. Ativan and lisinopril have been held, and the patient will need an outpatient allergy workup.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient was dialyzed today and will require daily dialysis to treat uremia.
5. Afib on coumadin: The patient's INR was subtherapeutic upon admission, and it is unclear if she was taking her medications at home. Metoprolol has been started for rate control, and IV beta-blockers will be given as needed for rapid ventricular rate (RVR).
6. HTN: The patient has hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol and amlodipine. Lisinopril has been discontinued due to its association with angioedema.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient will continue to receive statins.
8. DM: The patient has diabetes and is being treated with insulin sliding scale (RISS) and frequent glucose checks (FSG) qid.
9. FEN: The patient is on a diabetic/renal diet.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of AMS: The patient's mental status may deteriorate if her underlying conditions are not properly managed.
2. Angioedema: The patient may experience further episodes of angioedema if ativan or other medications are not properly managed.
3. ESRD progression: The patient's kidney function may worsen if her dialysis regimen is not optimized.
4. Afib: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if her anticoagulation therapy is not properly managed.
5. HTN: The patient's blood pressure may not be adequately controlled if her medications are not optimized.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid profile may worsen if her statin therapy is not effective.
7. DM: The patient's blood glucose levels may not be adequately controlled if her insulin regimen is not optimized.
8. FEN: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance may be compromised if her diet is not properly managed.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Heparin sodium for prophylaxis
2. Lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
3. Coumadin 2 mg daily
4. Valproic acid 250 mg daily
5. Keppra 500 mg daily + HD
6. Amlodipine 5 mg daily
7. Metoprolol 50 mg TID
8. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily
9. Insulin sliding scale
10. Sertraline 100 mg daily
11. Cinacalcet 90 mg daily
12. Nephrocaps daily

The patient's current laboratory results include:

1. White blood cell count: 9.6
2. Hematocrit: 33.0
3. Platelet count: 390
4. Creatinine: 14.5
5. Blood urea nitrogen: 72

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, admitted with AMS
   likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis, transferred to MICU
   after intubation for airway protection following a seizure +/-
   angioedema secondary to ?ativan.
   1.  Airway.  Patient initially intubated for airway protection in
   post-ictal state +/- angioedema secondary to ?ativan.  Was apneic and
   without cuff leak initially.  Extubated yesterday and doing well now on
   room air.
   2.  AMS.  Admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to
   missing dialysis and opioids at home.  Her mental status now is
   appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative.   EEG (prelim)
   negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- d/c depakote
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   3.  Angioedema.  This  may have been due to ativan administration.
   Given steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak yesterday.  Has
   h/o ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.

   4. ESRD on HD: Dialyzed today.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal
   -- continue nephrocaps and sensipar

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD, s/p failed kidney transplant, and recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis. She was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) likely secondary to missing dialysis and opioids at home. She was intubated for airway protection following a seizure and angioedema secondary to?ativan.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.2°C (98.9°F), Tcurrent 36.8°C (98.2°F), HR 69 bpm, BP 134/64 mmHg, RR 13 insp/min, SpO2 98%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV, Vt 331 mL, PS 5 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 8 cmH2O, MAP 70 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: 228 mL total in, 108 mL IVF, 0 mL total out.
* Lab results: WBC 9.6 K/uL, Hct 33.0%, Plt 390 K/uL, Cr 14.5 mg/dL, TCO2 19 mmHg, Glucose 63 mg/dL, etc.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may require further adjustments to her ventilator settings or oxygen therapy.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of Afib and is taking metoprolol for rate control. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is taking anticoagulant medications, including heparin, and has a history of central venous DVT. Close monitoring of her bleeding risk and coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Close monitoring of her temperature and laboratory results is necessary.
5. Neurological complications: The patient had a seizure and is at risk for further neurological complications. Close monitoring of her neurological status and laboratory results is necessary.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and constipation due to her medications and underlying condition.
7. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is at risk for further renal deterioration. Close monitoring of her renal function and electrolytes is necessary.

In conclusion, the patient's current condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including ESRD on HD, failed kidney transplant, and recent surgery for benign pneumatosis. She presents with acute episodes of altered mental status, respiratory failure, and angioedema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is a risk of prolonged intubation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status can lead to delirium, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
3. Angioedema: The patient's history of angioedema may increase her risk of recurrent episodes, especially with the continued use of certain medications.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing dialysis, and missing dialysis sessions can lead to uremic complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and seizures.
5. Afib on coumadin: The patient's subtherapeutic INR may increase her risk of bleeding, especially with the continued use of anticoagulant medications.
6. HTN: The patient's HTN may worsen her cardiovascular risk, especially with the continued use of certain medications.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
8. DM: The patient's DM may worsen her cardiovascular risk, especially with the continued use of certain medications.
9. FEN: The patient's FEN may lead to malnutrition, especially if she is unable to tolerate oral nutrition.
10. ACCESS: The patient's access issues, including the need for a PICC line, may increase her risk of bleeding and infection.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, angioedema, ESRD on HD, Afib on coumadin, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, FEN, and ACCESS issues. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to minimize the risk of these complications."
