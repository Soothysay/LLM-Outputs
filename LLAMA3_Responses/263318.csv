   Assessment and Plan
   18 F, college student, no past medical history, admit to MICU with
   septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve
   deficits.
   # Septic shock.  During early MICU course, patient developing
   progressive hypotensive, not completely responsive to fluid boluses;
   hypotension persisting despite normal CVP (>10).  Starting levophed.
   Abnormal neck and cranial nerve exams as above.  Source of infection:
   neck/adenopathy ?Lemierre
s; septic cavernous venous thrombosis,
   meningitis/other CNS infection; pulmonary source (abnormal CXR and
   exam), GI source -> GNR bacteremia; GYN source (less likely as patient
   not sexually active), urinary organisms.   Clinically, Lemierres with
   cavernous venous thrombosis seems to be most consistent with clinical
   picture, though prelim read of MRI negative for this.
   -          CVL in place, goal CVP 8-12.  Bolus prn to achieve this.
   -          Aline in place, MAP goal 60-65.    Levophed if needed.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics
 cefepime (at CNS doses), vanco,
   flagyl. Coverage of GNRs, fusobacterium, staph/strep, meningitis bugs.
   Appreciate ID input.
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH and here.
   -          Urine cultures, stool cultures if diarrhea.
   -          MRI of neck as below.
   -          Consider panCt with contrast if answer not found from
   MRI/MRA/MRV.
   -          Consider LP.
   -          Consider activated protein C, though ?DIC/thrombocytopenia
   as a contraindication.  Calculate APACHE.
   -          Glucose control
   -          Discuss steroids if pressor requirement increases and doing
   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement.  Lung exam also
   evolving with worsening breath sounds on L>R side.  Tachypneic to the
   40s -> ?need to intubate.
   -          Continue to monitor; low threshold for intubation.
   -          [**Month (only) 51**] need ARDSnet on vent
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy
   -          Consider rule out PE, especially if considering septic
   thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities.  Appears to have deficits of III, ?IV,
   V, ?X (vs. longerstanding uvular deviation).  NCHCT at OSH reportedly
   normal.  Findings along with septic picture concerning for cavernous
   venous thrombosis, however, prelim read of MRI not suggestive of this.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.
   -          Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recs.
   -          If +cavernous venous thrombosis , ?benefits of
   anticoagulation.
   -          Likely LP tonight.
   # ARF.  Volume depletion vs. prerenal from hypotension, vs. ischemic
   ATN/septic ATN.  Slowly improving with IVFs.
   -          continue to bolus for cvp <[**11-29**].
   -          Urine lytes
   -          Careful I/O, foley in place.
   -          ?need for gent or CT contrast; will discuss.
   # DIC.  Elevated coags, dropping platelets, anemia with schistocytes.
   -          continue to monitor, including fibrinogen
   -          consider blood products peri-procedure prn.
   -          Need to review IHOS peripheral smear.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Elevated lactate here, also with ARF.
   -          monitor ABG/VBG
   -          Ensure adequate MAPs/perfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old college student admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole, and has been treated with fluid boluses and vasopressors. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including septic shock, respiratory distress, cranial nerve abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is not fully controlled, and the patient is still requiring vasopressors. This increases the risk of further organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and the patient may require more aggressive respiratory support. The patient's lung exam is worsening, and the patient is at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cranial nerve deficits: The patient's cranial nerve deficits are concerning for potential cavernous venous thrombosis, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is not fully resolved, and the patient is at risk for further kidney damage.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's DIC is a significant concern, and the patient is at risk for further bleeding complications.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is a concern, and the patient may require further management to address this issue.
7. Infection: The patient has a significant infection, and the patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status is unstable, and the patient is at risk for further cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's septic shock and adjust therapy as needed to control the patient's blood pressure and perfusion.
2. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's cranial nerve deficits and consider anticoagulation therapy if cavernous venous thrombosis is suspected.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute kidney injury, including fluid management and dialysis as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's DIC and adjust therapy as needed to control bleeding complications.
6. Manage the patient's metabolic acidosis, including adjusting insulin therapy and ensuring adequate perfusion.
7. Consider further imaging studies, including MRI and CT scans, to further evaluate the patient's condition.
8. Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic individual with multiple organ dysfunction. The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, and they have been admitted to the ICU. 

The patient has undergone various diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, including blood cultures, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture, and placement of central venous lines and arterial lines. The patient's lab results indicate acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 120/63 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2. 

The patient's medical history is significant for sepsis, meningitis, and acute renal failure. The patient has a code status of full code and is currently receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and insulin sliding scale. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.
2. Meningitis-related complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and brain edema.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure and mortality.
4. Renal failure, which can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed promptly.
5. Coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure due to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy.
7. Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition, due to prolonged ICU stay and inadequate nutrition.

In conclusion, this patient requires close monitoring and management of their sepsis, meningitis, and acute renal failure. Prompt recognition and treatment of potential complications are crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality."

   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement.  Lung exam also
   evolving with worsening breath sounds on L>R side.  Tachypneic to the
   40s -> ?need to intubate.
   -          Continue to monitor; low threshold for intubation.
   -          [**Month (only) 51**] need ARDSnet on vent
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy

   thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities.  Appears to have deficits of III, ?IV,
   V, ?X (vs. longerstanding uvular deviation).  NCHCT at OSH reportedly
   normal.  Findings along with septic picture concerning for cavernous
   venous thrombosis, however, prelim read of MRI not suggestive of this.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.
   -          Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old college student with no past medical history, admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Septic shock: The patient is hypotensive and not responding to fluid boluses, requiring the use of vasopressors.
2. GNR bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for GNRs, which is a potential source of infection.
3. Cranial nerve deficits: The patient has deficits of III, IV, V, and possibly X cranial nerves, which may be related to septic cavernous venous thrombosis.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient has worsening tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirement, which may require intubation.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a low urine output and is at risk of developing acute kidney injury.
6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has elevated coagulation studies and is at risk of bleeding.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels and may be at risk of developing metabolic acidosis.

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole, which cover GNRs, fusobacterium, staph/strep, and meningitis bugs. The patient is also receiving vasopressors, including norepinephrine and levophed, to manage hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk of developing organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
2. Meningitis: The patient has a positive blood culture for GNRs, which may be a source of meningitis.
3. Cavernous venous thrombosis: The patient has cranial nerve deficits and may be at risk of developing cavernous venous thrombosis.
4. ARDS: The patient has respiratory distress and may be at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. DIC: The patient has elevated coagulation studies and is at risk of bleeding.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels and may be at risk of developing metabolic acidosis.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Monitoring for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
3. Managing hypotension with vasopressors.
4. Monitoring for signs of meningitis.
5. Considering panCt with contrast if the source of infection is not identified.
6. Monitoring for signs of cavernous venous thrombosis.
7. Managing respiratory distress with intubation if necessary.
8. Monitoring for signs of ARDS.
9. Monitoring for signs of DIC.
10. Managing metabolic acidosis with insulin therapy."

   as a contraindication.
   -          Glucose control
   -          Discuss steroids if pressor requirement increases and doing
   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory failure.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement, requiring intubation.
   -          ARDSnet on vent; keep paO2 >55, pH >7.2.
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy
   -          Rule out PE, especially if considering septic thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities/?venous thrombosis/meningitis.  Appears
   to have deficits of II, III, ?IV, V.  Findings along with septic
   picture concerning for cavernous venous thrombosis. MRI initially read
   as normal; now appears to have significant abnormalities with multiple
   re-reads.  ?cavernous venous thrombosis.  LP with elevated OP (52) and
   picture c/w bacterial meningitis.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.
   -          Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recs.
   -          ?anticoagulation for septic thrombosis
   -          ?more monitoring for increased ICP given elevated opening
   pressure.
   # ARF.  Volume depletion vs. prerenal from hypotension, vs. ischemic
   ATN/septic ATN.  Also consider possible ?TTP as dropping platelets,
   [**Doctor First Name 3468**] picture.  Slowly improving with IVFs.
   -          Careful I/O, foley in place.
   -          Renal consult today.
   # DIC.  Elevated coags, dropping platelets, anemia with schistocytes.
          -      hematology consult.
   -          continue to monitor, including fibrinogen
   -          consider blood products peri-procedure prn; needs blood
   consent.
   -          Need to review IHOS peripheral smear with hematology.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Elevated lactate here, also with ARF.
   -          monitor ABG/VBG
   -          Ensure adequate MAPs/perfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 F, college student, no past medical history, admit to MICU with
   septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve
   deficits.
   # Septic shock.  Requiring levophed for BP support.  Abnormal neck and
   cranial nerve exams as above; meningitis by CSF  and GNR Bacteremia in
   anaerobic bottles - ?fusobacterium.  Clinically, Lemierres with
   cavernous venous thrombosis seems to be most consistent with clinical
   picture, though prelim read of MRI negative for this.
   -          CVL in place, goal CVP 8-12.
   -          Aline in place, MAP goal 60-65.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics
 cefepime (at CNS doses), vanco,
   flagyl, ampicillin, acyclovir. Coverage of GNRs, fusobacterium,
   staph/strep, meningitis bugs.  Appreciate ID input.
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH and here.
   -          f/u MRI neck, ?CTA neck.
   -          PanCT today likely.
   -          Check TTE.
   -          D/W ENT re: imaging modality for neck/venous abnormalities
   ?thrombosis.
   -          Consider activated protein C, though ?DIC/thrombocytopenia
   as a contraindication.
   -          Glucose control
   -          Discuss steroids if pressor requirement increases and doing
   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory failure.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement, requiring intubation.
   -          ARDSnet on vent; keep paO2 >55, pH >7.2.
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy
   -          Rule out PE, especially if considering septic thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities/?venous thrombosis/meningitis.  Appears
   to have deficits of II, III, ?IV, V.  Findings along with septic
   picture concerning for cavernous venous thrombosis. MRI initially read
   as normal; now appears to have significant abnormalities with multiple
   re-reads.  ?cavernous venous thrombosis.  LP with elevated OP (52) and
   picture c/w bacterial meningitis.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.
   -          Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recs.
   -          ?anticoagulation for septic thrombosis
   -          ?more monitoring for increased ICP given elevated opening
   pressure.
   # ARF.  Volume depletion vs. prerenal from hypotension, vs. ischemic
   ATN/septic ATN.  Also consider possible ?TTP as dropping platelets,
   [**Doctor First Name 3468**] picture.  Slowly improving with IVFs.
   -          Careful I/O, foley in place.
   -          Renal consult today.
   # DIC.  Elevated coags, dropping platelets, anemia with schistocytes.
          -      hematology consult.
   -          continue to monitor, including fibrinogen
   -          consider blood products peri-procedure prn; needs blood
   consent.
   -          Need to review IHOS peripheral smear with hematology.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Elevated lactate here, also with ARF.
   -          monitor ABG/VBG
   -          Ensure adequate MAPs/perfusion.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Meningitis: The patient's lumbar puncture (LP) revealed cloudy fluid with elevated opening pressure (OP) and a high white blood cell count (WBC), which is consistent with bacterial meningitis.
3. Cavernous venous thrombosis: The patient's MRI revealed abnormalities, including enhancement along the right dura of the cavernous sinus and right temporal lobe dura, which may indicate cavernous venous thrombosis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDSnet on vent and increasing oxygen requirement suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ARF and elevated creatinine levels suggest a high risk of AKI.
6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated coagulation studies and dropping platelet count suggest a high risk of DIC.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and metabolic acidosis may indicate inadequate perfusion or septic shock.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's cranial nerve deficits, including deficits of II, III, and possibly IV and V, may indicate neurological complications, including septic thrombosis or meningitis.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's septic shock and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover GNRs, fusobacterium, staph/strep, and meningitis bugs.
2. Intensive monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
3. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
5. Renal support, including fluid management and consideration of renal replacement therapy.
6. Coagulation management, including platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Neurological support, including monitoring of cranial nerve function and consideration of anticoagulation therapy.
8. Cardiovascular support, including cardiac monitoring and consideration of vasopressor therapy.

The patient's care plan should also include regular assessments of the patient's condition, including frequent vital sign checks, neurological assessments, and laboratory tests to monitor for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) ,concern for
   enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus with an OP of
   52 on LP and 900 WBC in the CSF
   Septic Shock/Meningitis: Concern for GNR in the blood (anaerobic
   bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Given the
   imaging findings there is significant concern for a evolving cavernous
   sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the
   temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for
   a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to
   cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime and
   Vancomycin.She received a dose of dexamethasone after the LP.  We also
   have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV given the quesiton of enhancement
   of the dura of the temporal lobe. We  will dicuss further with ID and
   neurosurgery the need for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
   Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess
   and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI
   - Q 8 hr lactate and can check mixed venous sat
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   - recalculate APACHE, will need to re-consider APC
   - Follow up with ID and neurosurgery re: anticoagulation and sinus
   thrombosis
   - TTE
   - She will need dexamethasone
   Increased intracranial pressure: will d/w with neurosurgery re:
   Hypoxemic respi failure: her CXRs have evolved a pattern concerning for
   ARDS over the last 12 hrs concomitant with her respi decline. She is
   currently intubated and sedated via ARDS guidelines. We will plan to
   image the lungs with CT scan today to further evaluate
   - ARDS ventilation: Goal PaO2 > 55mmHg, ph>7.20
   - CT scan of the chest today (PE protocol)
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We will consult with Heme today, given
   that we may need to anti-coagulate for a potential sinus thrombosis.
   The management of the DIC is likely to be supportive. Concern also
   exists potentially for TTP
   - Cont to folloq q 6hrs DIC labs
   - peripheral smear
   - Hematology consult
   - CT abd (given other potential etiology of thrombocytopenia would be
   splenic sequestration)
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal as she had a Cr of 2.5 at the OSH and is now 1.4. We will
   check urine lytes. Her UOP is below goal. We also need to be concerned
   for TTP given her overall presentation and the presence of schistos on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) ,concern for
   enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus with an OP of
   52 on LP and 900 WBC in the CSF
   Septic Shock/Meningitis: Concern for GNR in the blood (anaerobic
   bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Given the
   imaging findings there is significant concern for a evolving cavernous
   sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the
   temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for
   a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to
   cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime and
   Vancomycin.She received a dose of dexamethasone after the LP.  We also
   have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV given the quesiton of enhancement
   of the dura of the temporal lobe. We  will dicuss further with ID and
   neurosurgery the need for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
   Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess
   and no cord evolvement.

   - CT scan of the chest today (PE protocol)
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We will consult with Heme today, given
   that we may need to anti-coagulate for a potential sinus thrombosis.
   The management of the DIC is likely to be supportive. Concern also
   exists potentially for TTP

   Discussed with Neurology, Neurosurgery and Neuroradiology.  After
   discussiong with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1836**] (Neuroradiology) there is significant
   abnormalities at the level of the R-Cavernous sinus compatible with
   infection and possible sinus cavernous thrombosis. After discussing
   benefits and risks of anticoagulation with the family we decided to
   proceed with anticoagulation with IV heparin (no bolus/ goal PTT 50)
   F/u PT/INR and PLts closely.
   We will continue IV antibiotics with Flagyl/ Vanco/ Cefipime and d/c
   Acyclovir and Ampicillin. Also continue with dexamethasoner 10 mg q6hr.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia. She has a high OP on CSF and 900 WBC, suggesting meningitis. Imaging studies show abnormal enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus, which may be due to inflammation/infection or sinus thrombosis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin. She is also receiving dexamethasone and acyclovir to cover for HSV.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's GNR bacteremia and meningitis put her at risk for septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The abnormal enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus may be due to sinus thrombosis, which can lead to severe complications, including brain herniation and death.
3. Meningitis: The patient's high OP on CSF and 900 WBC suggest meningitis, which can lead to brain damage, hearing loss, and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and hypoxemic respiratory failure put her at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator dependence and death.
5. DIC: The patient's evolving DIC physiology, including elevated INR, PTT, and decreased platelets, puts her at risk for bleeding and organ failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's Cr of 2.5 at the OSH and current Cr of 1.4 suggest pre-renal azotemia, which can lead to renal failure and death.
7. TTP: The patient's thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on the peripheral smear suggest TTP, which can lead to severe bleeding and organ failure.
8. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's meningitis and potential sinus thrombosis put her at risk for increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to brain herniation and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for GNR and HSV.
2. Monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue anticoagulation with IV heparin to prevent sinus thrombosis.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment for DIC as necessary.
6. Consider transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma to support platelet function.
7. Continue monitoring the patient's respiratory function and adjust ventilation as necessary.
8. Consider imaging the patient's brain and neck to further evaluate the extent of sinus thrombosis and potential complications."

   image the lungs with CT scan today to further evaluate
   - ARDS ventilation: Goal PaO2 > 55mmHg, ph>7.20
   - CT scan of the chest today (PE protocol)
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We will consult with Heme today, given
   that we may need to anti-coagulate for a potential sinus thrombosis.
   The management of the DIC is likely to be supportive. Concern also
   exists potentially for TTP

   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal as she had a Cr of 2.5 at the OSH and is now 1.4. We will
   check urine lytes. Her UOP is below goal. We also need to be concerned

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) ,concern for
   enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus with an OP of
   52 on LP and 900 WBC in the CSF
   Septic Shock/Meningitis: Concern for GNR in the blood (anaerobic
   bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Given the
   imaging findings there is significant concern for a evolving cavernous
   sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the
   temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for
   a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to
   cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime and
   Vancomycin.She received a dose of dexamethasone after the LP.  We also
   have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV given the quesiton of enhancement
   of the dura of the temporal lobe. We  will dicuss further with ID and
   neurosurgery the need for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
   Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess
   and no cord evolvement.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia. She has developed septic shock and meningitis, with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC in the CSF. Imaging findings suggest enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus, which may indicate inflammation or infection.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin, as well as antiviral medication to cover for HSV. She has also been given dexamethasone after the LP to reduce intracranial pressure.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is suspected to be caused by ARDS. She is also experiencing DIC, which is likely related to her GNR bacteremia and meningitis. The patient's platelet count is low, and her fibrinogen level is elevated, which suggests an evolving DIC physiology.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and her urine output is below goal. She may also be at risk for TTP due to her overall presentation and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear.

The patient's medical issues include:

1. Septic shock and meningitis due to GNR bacteremia
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure with ARDS
3. DIC with low platelet count and elevated fibrinogen level
4. Renal failure with compromised renal function
5. Potential risk of TTP
6. Inflammation or infection in the cavernous sinus, which may indicate sinus thrombosis

The potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sinus thrombosis
2. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure
3. Respiratory failure and ARDS
4. DIC and bleeding complications
5. Renal failure and acute kidney injury
6. TTP and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
7. Infection and sepsis

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical issues, including:

1. Antibiotic therapy for GNR bacteremia and meningitis
2. Antiviral medication to cover for HSV
3. Dexamethasone to reduce intracranial pressure
4. Supportive care for respiratory failure and ARDS
5. Management of DIC, including platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy
6. Renal consultation and management of renal failure
7. Hematology consultation and management of TTP
8. Neurosurgical consultation for potential sinus thrombosis and cerebral edema."

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely
   thrombosed-yet- as neither it nor the R superior ophthalmic vein is
   enlarged,
   but this should be followed as a potential complication. Very early
   sinus
   thrombosis cannot absolutely be excluded. MRA BRAIN: Normal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -MRI/MRV showed right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding
   abscess
   - LP gram stain negative, cultures pending (990 WBCs, Opening pressure
   >50) - CSF crypto negative.
   - GNRs in [**3-23**] bottles from [**Location (un) 615**] blood cultures.   Speciation will be
   complete in the evening today.
   -Neurology recommended serial LPs to lower ICP. They did not recommend
   anticoagulation given the risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
   inability to difinitively state that there was a cavernous sinus
   thrombus.  They did not recomend continuous ICP monitoring.  They also
   recommended sending off state encephalitus panel, CMV pcr, VZV prn, EMV
   pcr.
   -Neurosurgery did not recommend continuous ICP monitoring.
   -ID believes this is Lemierre's disase with cavernous veins
   thrombosis. felt ampicillin could be stopped due to presence of GNR
   bacteremia.  Acyclovir can be stopped when HSV PCR is negative.
   - Renal felt renal failure was pre-renal renal failure and requested
   UOsms be sent
   - ENT performed throat culture.  They are concerned about right upper
   wisdom tooth infection and recommended oral surgery consult
   - Heme feels clinical picture is consistent with DIC.  They agree with
   role of anticoagulation given cavernous venous thrombus.
   - Oral surgery suspects possible 3rd molar infection which drains to
   pterygoid plexus --> emissary veins --> cavernous sinus
   - sedation lighted to bolus sedation with good effect
   - Anticoagulated for approximately 8 hours.  Heparin stopped due to
   thrombocytopenia.
   - RSBI of 50 this morning
   - echo showed:
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   - Renal function rapidly recovered
   -  CT Neck, torso performed

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient has a 24-hour history of Lemierre's disease, a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinuses.
* The patient has a right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding abscess, as evident from the MRI/MRV.
* The patient has developed septicemia with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in blood cultures, which is consistent with Lemierre's disease.
* The patient has undergone serial lumbar punctures (LPs) to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) and has been treated with antibiotics, including ampicillin, vancomycin, and acyclovir.
* The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which has led to the discontinuation of heparin anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Given the patient's history of Lemierre's disease and the presence of a cavernous venous thrombus, there is a risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which could worsen the patient's condition.
* Infection: The patient has developed septicemia, and there is a risk of further infection, particularly in the setting of a compromised immune system.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
* Renal failure: The patient has developed pre-renal renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
* DIC: The patient's clinical picture is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which could lead to further bleeding complications.
* Cerebral edema: The patient's ICP has not been monitored continuously, and there is a risk of cerebral edema, which could worsen the patient's condition.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of pneumonia or ARDS.
* Sepsis: The patient's septicemia could lead to sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely
   thrombosed-yet- as neither it nor the R superior ophthalmic vein is
   enlarged,
   but this should be followed as a potential complication. Very early
   sinus
   thrombosis cannot absolutely be excluded. MRA BRAIN: Normal
   intracranial
   arteries MRA NECK: Normal carotids/vertebrals MRV HEAD: Normal MRV [**Name Initial (MD) **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely
   thrombosed-yet- as neither it nor the R superior ophthalmic vein is
   enlarged,
   but this should be followed as a potential complication. Very early
   sinus
   thrombosis cannot absolutely be excluded. MRA BRAIN: Normal
   intracranial
   arteries MRA NECK: Normal carotids/vertebrals MRV HEAD: Normal MRV [**Name Initial (MD) **]

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old college student admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits. The patient has a history of Lemierre's disease with cavernous venous thrombosis, and the diagnosis is being re-evaluated. The patient has undergone multiple imaging studies, including MRI, CT, and MRA, which have revealed abnormalities in the cavernous sinus and surrounding areas. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation has been initiated. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and the ICU team is considering additional interventions, including activated protein C, steroids, and blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, cranial nerve deficits, and septic thromboembolism.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and bacteremia can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
3. DIC: The patient's laboratory results suggest the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to bleeding, organ failure, and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and the patient is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the patient is at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death if not properly managed.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding and increased risk of hemorrhage.
8. Elevated intracranial pressure: The patient's elevated intracranial pressure can lead to brain herniation, cerebral edema, and death if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticoagulation.
2. Monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Consider additional interventions, such as activated protein C, steroids, and blood products.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's elevated intracranial pressure and consider interventions to reduce ICP, such as mannitol or hypertonic saline."

   24 Hour Events:
   -MRI/MRV showed right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding
   abscess
   - LP gram stain negative, cultures pending (990 WBCs, Opening pressure
   >50) - CSF crypto negative.
   - GNRs in [**3-23**] bottles from [**Location (un) 615**] blood cultures.   Speciation will be
   complete in the evening today.
   -Neurology recommended serial LPs to lower ICP. They did not recommend
   anticoagulation given the risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
   inability to difinitively state that there was a cavernous sinus
   thrombus.  They did not recomend continuous ICP monitoring.  They also
   recommended sending off state encephalitus panel, CMV pcr, VZV prn, EMV
   pcr.
   -Neurosurgery did not recommend continuous ICP monitoring.
   -ID believes this is Lemierre's disase with cavernous veins
   thrombosis. felt ampicillin could be stopped due to presence of GNR
   bacteremia.  Acyclovir can be stopped when HSV PCR is negative.
   - Renal felt renal failure was pre-renal renal failure and requested
   UOsms be sent
   - ENT performed throat culture.  They are concerned about right upper
   wisdom tooth infection and recommended oral surgery consult
   - Heme feels clinical picture is consistent with DIC.  They agree with
   role of anticoagulation given cavernous venous thrombus.
   - Oral surgery suspects possible 3rd molar infection which drains to
   pterygoid plexus --> emissary veins --> cavernous sinus
   - sedation lighted to bolus sedation with good effect
   - Anticoagulated for approximately 8 hours.  Heparin stopped due to
   thrombocytopenia.
   - RSBI of 50 this morning

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil.  Now improved ability to raise right eyelid and ?mild
   reactivity to right eye.  Was briefly anticoagulated yesterday, but
   anticoagulation held with platelets fells to 48 and remained below 50.
   After discussion with heme, will resume anticoagulation after tooth
   extract and transfuse platelets if necessary.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Bolus sedation to improve ability to assess mental status
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: cavernous sinus thrombosis
   24 Hour Events:
   -MRI/MRV showed right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding
   abscess
   - LP gram stain negative, cultures pending (990 WBCs, Opening pressure
   >50) - CSF crypto negative.
   - GNRs in [**3-23**] bottles from [**Location (un) 615**] blood cultures.   Speciation will be
   complete in the evening today.
   -Neurology recommended serial LPs to lower ICP. They did not recommend
   anticoagulation given the risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
   inability to difinitively state that there was a cavernous sinus
   thrombus.  They did not recomend continuous ICP monitoring.  They also
   recommended sending off state encephalitus panel, CMV pcr, VZV prn, EMV
   pcr.
   -Neurosurgery did not recommend continuous ICP monitoring.
   -ID believes this is Lemierre's disase with cavernous veins
   thrombosis. felt ampicillin could be stopped due to presence of GNR
   bacteremia.  Acyclovir can be stopped when HSV PCR is negative.
   - Renal felt renal failure was pre-renal renal failure and requested
   UOsms be sent
   - ENT performed throat culture.  They are concerned about right upper
   wisdom tooth infection and recommended oral surgery consult
   - Heme feels clinical picture is consistent with DIC.  They agree with
   role of anticoagulation given cavernous venous thrombus.
   - Oral surgery suspects possible 3rd molar infection which drains to
   pterygoid plexus --> emissary veins --> cavernous sinus
   - sedation lighted to bolus sedation with good effect
   - Anticoagulated for approximately 8 hours.  Heparin stopped due to
   thrombocytopenia.
   - RSBI of 50 this morning
   - echo showed:
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   - Renal function rapidly recovered
   -  CT Neck, torso performed

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia, and DIC. She has a history of odontogenic infection, which likely led to the development of cavernous sinus thrombosis. She has been experiencing symptoms such as right ptosis, dilated pupil, and meningitis. The patient has undergone various treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulation, and dental extraction. She has also had several procedures, including a lumbar puncture, CT scans, and an echo.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic emboli: The patient has developed septic emboli in her chest, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.
2. Meningitis: The patient has meningitis, which could lead to further complications such as brain damage, hearing loss, or death.
3. DIC: The patient has DIC, which could lead to further complications such as bleeding, organ failure, or death.
4. Renal failure: The patient has pre-renal ARF, which could lead to further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is requiring mechanical ventilation, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has developed septic emboli in her chest, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or death.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has meningitis, which could lead to further complications such as brain damage, hearing loss, or death.

Action Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological exam and vital signs closely.
3. Consider performing a bubble study/TTE to evaluate for septic emboli.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation if possible.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Consider performing a CT scan or MRI to evaluate for further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute renal failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition is improving, with decreasing vasopressor requirements and increasing urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's imaging studies show a high likelihood of an evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis, which requires close monitoring and potential anticoagulation.
2. Anaerobic process: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest an anaerobic process, such as fusobacterium, which requires broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Meningitis: The patient's CSF studies show a high OP and 900 WBC, indicating meningitis, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
4. DIC: The patient's DIC physiology is likely related to her GNR bacteremia and meningitis, and requires supportive care, including platelet transfusions and anticoagulation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely related to pre-renal factors, and requires continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and IV hydration.
6. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral septic pulmonary emboli require close monitoring and potential pulmonary toilet.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's tube feeds and regular insulin sliding scale require close monitoring for potential gastrointestinal complications.
8. Infection control: The patient's multiple lines and tubes require careful infection control measures to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPs).

Next Steps:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover anaerobic and aerobic infections.
2. Monitor the patient's cavernous sinus thrombosis and potential anticoagulation.
3. Continue supportive care for DIC, including platelet transfusions and anticoagulation.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust NAC and IV hydration as needed.
5. Continue close monitoring for potential gastrointestinal complications.
6. Review the patient's infection control measures and adjust as needed.
7. Plan for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment for meningitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal PTT 50K
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and acute renal failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, anticoagulation, and supportive care.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 113 bpm
* Blood pressure: 107/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 10 mmHg, CO 7 L/min, CI 3.9 L/min/m2

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O. The patient's lung function is compromised, with a RSBI of 50 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 330.

* White blood cell count: 28.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 27.1%
* Platelet count: 75 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 109 mg/dL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* International normalized ratio (INR): 16.3
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 27.3 seconds
* Fibrinogen: 420 mg/dL
* D-dimer: 3509 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 210 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT scan of the neck: multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid muscle, parapharyngeal space, and longus muscle, consistent with early abscess formation
* TTE: no vegetations
* CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis: multiple areas of consolidation, atelectasis of the left lower lobe, and a small amount of pelvic free fluid

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Cavernous sinus thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and meningitis
* DIC with elevated INR, PTT, and decreased platelets
* Acute renal failure with pre-renal component
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral septic pulmonary emboli
* Anemia with evolving DIC physiology
* Renal infarct (right kidney) with concern for anti-coagulation

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage for GNR, anaerobic bacteria, and HSV
* Anti-coagulation with IV heparin
* Supportive care for DIC, including platelet transfusions and anti-coagulation
* Renal support with N-acetylcysteine and IV hydration
* Pulmonary toilet with PS ventilation
* Monitoring of the patient's condition and adjusting the plan of care as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill 18-year-old female with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal PTT 50K
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 18-year-old female, was admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin, and is being monitored for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 72 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

Her laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 69 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mmol/L
* Chloride: 102 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 18 mmol/L

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. She is also receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 60 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right pupil dilation
* Normocephalic head
* Endotracheal tube and oral gastric tube in place
* Cervical adenopathy
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm, non-rashy skin
* Attentive, oriented to name, and following simple commands

The patient's medical issues include:

* Sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and meningitis
* DIC with elevated INR, PTT, and decreased platelets
* Acute renal failure
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral septic pulmonary emboli
* Anemia with elevated INR and decreased platelets

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Supportive care for DIC and anemia
* Anti-coagulation with IV heparin
* Renal replacement therapy as needed
* Monitoring for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis
* Further evaluation and treatment for hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Consideration for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued progression of sinus cavernous thrombosis
* Development of further septic emboli
* Worsening of DIC and anemia
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Renal failure requiring dialysis
* Infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms
* Bleeding complications due to anti-coagulation therapy

I will continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to address these potential complications and optimize her care."

   Extensive right-sided facial swelling. Sinus disease within the
   right-sided
   paranasal sinuses including dense secretions within the right sphenoid
   sinus
   which may represent inspissated secretions versus an infectious process
   such
   as fungal infection. No bony erosive changes evident.
   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.
   - let her set I/O goal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU

   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. Current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/49 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anaerobic process: The patient's sinus cavernous thrombosis and GNR bacteremia may be complicated by an anaerobic process, such as fusobacterium, which requires broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
2. Meningitis: The patient's meningeal inflammation and GNR bacteremia may lead to meningitis, which requires prompt antibiotic treatment and close monitoring.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC physiology may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications, and requires close monitoring of coagulation parameters.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral septic pulmonary emboli may worsen, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure, and requires close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis, and requires close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections, which requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain abscess, which requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin.
2. Monitor coagulation parameters and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Monitor renal function and electrolyte levels and adjust fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
5. Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count, and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Monitor neurological function and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor and adjust anticoagulation therapy to achieve a goal aPTT of 50-60 seconds.

Note: The patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and prompt treatment to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 112/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has a diagnosis of septic shock, DIC, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and supportive care.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and DIC may lead to further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and DIC may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis may lead to further neurological deterioration, including seizures, brain edema, or stroke.
5. Renal failure: The patient's pre-renal azotemia may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's GNR bacteremia and meningitis may lead to further infectious complications, such as septicemia, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's DIC may lead to cardiovascular collapse or arrhythmias.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular function. Close communication with the multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and neurosurgeons, is crucial to ensure optimal care and management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil upon admission with stable neuro exam.  Getting
   anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.  Will
   transfuse platelets if < 50, though stable today after platelet
   transfusion yesterday prior to dental extraction.  Remains on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam (will switch
   propofol)
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess overnight.  On official
   read, study is limited.
   - neurosurg consult re:? need for surgical drainage of ??? abscess or
   need for further imaging
   3.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain, and NGTD.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u HSV PCR, csf culture
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   4.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir\
   5.        Thrombocytopenia.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable.  Thrombocytopenia likely
   secondary to DIC.
   - follow platelets
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].  Only able to drain a few ccs
   from parapharyngeal and masticator space.
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery
   -          drain removal tomorrow
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   8.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   9.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   10.    Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   8.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   9.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   10.    Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complex medical condition. The patient was admitted with a severe odontogenic infection, which led to cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is being anticoagulated with heparin, and her neurological exam is stable.
2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: A head CT showed a hypodense lesion in the temporal lobe, which may represent a partial volume averaging or early intracranial inflammatory or infective focus. A neurosurgery consult is recommended to determine if surgical drainage is necessary.
3. Meningitis: The patient has a likely inflammatory response in the meninges due to the cavernous sinus thrombus. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and HSV PCR and bacterial cultures are pending.
4. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, and her hemodynamics are improving off pressors.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, and her thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to DIC.
6. Dental infection: The patient underwent dental extraction, and the infection appears to have spread to the pterygoid muscle. She has GNRs in her blood cultures, which may represent fusobacterium.
7. Septic emboli: The patient has septic emboli in her chest CT, which may be related to her dental infection. A TEE showed no ASD, but did not evaluate for PFO.
8. DIC: The patient's fibrinogen is falling, and her platelet count is stable. Her INR is trending down, and her fibrin split product is mildly rising.
9. Elevated intracranial pressure: The patient has an opening pressure of 51 on LP, but her neuro exam is unchanged. She is being monitored for signs of worsening ICP.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient is requiring less and less ventilator support and may be extubated today.
11. Renal failure: The patient's pre-renal ARF is resolving, and she received several contrast loads yesterday.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* WBC: 20.3
* Hct: 27.0
* Plt: 69
* Cr: 1.1
* TCO2: 18
* Glucose: 158
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.4/40.4/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 40//, ALT/AST: 24/30, Alk Phos/T Bili: 82/1.4, Differential-Neuts: 89.4%, Band: 2.0%, Lymph: 8.6%, Mono: 1.9%, Eos: 0.0%, D-dimer: 3509 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 420 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, LDH: 216 IU/L, Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results are as follows:

* CT head: A directed study to rule out evidence of endocarditis and ASD showed no spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size, and normal right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion.
* CT sinuses: The patient has extensive right-sided sinus disease, with increased density of the right sphenoid sinus material that may represent inspissated secretions or less likely fungal sinusitis.
* Chest CT: The patient has septic emboli in her chest CT, which may be related to her dental infection.
* TEE: The patient has no ASD, but did not evaluate for PFO.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Anticoagulation with heparin
* Monitor neurological exam
* Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Continue dexamethasone
* Consider stopping acyclovir if HSV PCR is negative
* Follow platelets
* F/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
* F/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
* Continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
* F/u HSV PCR, csf culture
* F/u blood cultures from OSH
* F/u platelet transfusions
* F/u DIC labs (q6 hours)
* Transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
* Appreciate heme recs
* Hold off on serial LPs but will consider if there is evidence of worsening ICP
* Continue with pressure support
* Propofol for sedation
* Fluid boluses for low urine output
* Monitor creatinine
* Really dose all medications

The patient's disposition is ICU care, and her code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch-tall individual with a history of tooth removal, drain placement in the retromandibular space, and TEE done in the OR. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, with a Tmax of 38.2°C, HR of 72 bpm, and RR of 19 inspirations per minute. The patient's blood pressure is 112/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 98%. The patient has a history of sinus disease, including dense secretions in the right sphenoid sinus, which may represent inspissated secretions or an infectious process such as fungal infection. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.3, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 69. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and the patient's troponin-T level is 0.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and a ratio of 33. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, but the patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 380, which may indicate a degree of hypoxemia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's lung injury is severe, with bilateral airspace consolidation and a high ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The patient's chest radiograph shows bilateral airspace consolidation, which may represent ARDS or multifocal pneumonia.
3. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's facial swelling and sinus disease may indicate a thrombotic process in the cavernous sinus.
4. Meningitis: The patient's fever, headache, and altered mental status may indicate a central nervous system infection such as meningitis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
6. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is 112/49 mmHg, which may indicate a degree of hypotension.
7. Infection: The patient's sinus disease and facial swelling may indicate an infectious process, such as fungal infection or abscess.
8. Endocarditis: The patient's TEE did not show evidence of endocarditis, but the patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, which may indicate a low likelihood of endocarditis.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the patient is at risk for developing these potential medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil.  Now improved ability to raise right eyelid and ?mild
   reactivity to right eye.  Was briefly anticoagulated yesterday, but
   anticoagulation held with platelets fells to 48 and remained below 50.
   After discussion with heme, will resume anticoagulation after tooth
   extract and transfuse platelets if necessary.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Bolus sedation to improve ability to assess mental status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has undergone several procedures, including dental extraction, TEE, and drainage of the pterygoid muscle abscess.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved bilateral airspace consolidation and a decreasing need for ventilator support. However, the patient remains at risk for several potential complications, including:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient has a history of right-sided facial swelling and dilated pupil, which may indicate ongoing thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy is planned to resume after tooth extraction.
2. Meningitis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and negative gram stain on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. HSV PCR and bacterial culture are pending. If the HSV PCR is negative, acyclovir may be discontinued.
3. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and may have fusobacteremia given the dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles. Hemodynamic improvement is noted, but the patient remains at risk for further complications.
4. Septic emboli: The patient has septic emboli on chest CT with possible renal infarct, indicating left and right-sided infarction. A bubble study/TTE is planned in the OR today.
5. DIC: The patient has low-grade DIC, with fibrinogen trending down initially but now in the 400s. Platelets are stable at 50, and INR remains stable at around 1.6. Fibrin split product is mildly rising.
6. Elevated intracranial pressure: The patient has an opening pressure of 51 on LP, but was intubated with high PEEP. Neuro exam is unchanged, and DIC may affect the patient's ability to tolerate serial LPs.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient requires less and less ventilator support, but may need to remain intubated for several procedures.
8. Renal failure: Pre-renal ARF is resolving, and the patient has received several contrast loads with hydration and mucomyst.

To manage these potential complications, the patient will require:

1. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin after tooth extraction.
2. Close monitoring of neurological exam and consideration of serial LPs if ICP worsens.
3. Continued antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and acyclovir.
4. Serial DIC labs (q6 hours) and transfusion of platelets and cryo as needed.
5. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid status.
6. Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.
7. Ongoing nutrition and glycemic control management.

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU, and a family meeting has been held to discuss the patient's condition and treatment plan. The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil upon admission with stable neuro exam.  Getting
   anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.  Will
   transfuse platelets if < 50, though stable today after platelet
   transfusion yesterday prior to dental extraction.  Remains on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam (will switch
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   Thrombocytopenia
   .
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil upon admission with stable neuro exam.  Getting
   anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.  Will
   transfuse platelets if < 50, though stable today after platelet
   transfusion yesterday prior to dental extraction.  Remains on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam (will switch
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   Thrombocytopenia
   .
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications are potential:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient has a history of odontogenic infection, which has spread to the cavernous sinus, leading to thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy is ongoing to prevent further clot formation.
2. Meningitis: The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a marked elevation of white blood cells, which is consistent with meningitis. HSV PCR and bacterial cultures are pending to determine the cause.
3. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is likely related to the dental infection. Hemodynamic instability has improved, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to the sepsis or DIC.
5. Dental infection: The patient has a severe dental infection, which has spread to the pterygoid muscle and is causing septic emboli.
6. Septic emboli: The patient has developed septic emboli in the chest, which may be related to the dental infection or sepsis.
7. DIC: The patient has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is likely related to the sepsis and dental infection.
8. Elevated intracranial pressure: The patient's opening pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) was 51, which is elevated. However, the neuro exam is unchanged.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has a RSBI of 50, which indicates a high risk of respiratory failure.
10. Renal failure: The patient has pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI), which is resolving. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further kidney damage.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent further clot formation.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the sepsis and dental infection.
3. Drainage of the pterygoid muscle abscess.
4. Serial lumbar punctures to monitor intracranial pressure.
5. Ongoing monitoring of the patient's neurological exam.
6. Consideration of stopping acyclovir if HSV PCR is negative.
7. Appreciation of ID and neuro recs.
8. Consideration of extubation if the patient's respiratory status improves.
9. Ongoing monitoring of the patient's renal function and fluid status.
10. Consideration of TEE with bubble study to evaluate for septic emboli."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, can decrease rate to
   1150.
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, ?d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate) for further
   evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir\
   4.        Thrombocytopenia.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable.  Thrombocytopenia likely
   secondary to DIC.
   - follow platelets
   .
   5.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].  Only able to drain a few ccs
   from parapharyngeal and masticator space.
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery
   -          drain removal tomorrow
   6.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   7.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: septic shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cultures still pending.
   - Heparin gtt continued (increased to 1200), platelets greater than
   100.
   - Neuro recs: MRI to further eval area with concern for abscess;
   holding off on but potentially will schedule today (not yet ordered).

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, can decrease rate to
   1150.
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, ?d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate) for further
   evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir\
   4.        Thrombocytopenia.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable.  Thrombocytopenia likely
   secondary to DIC.
   - follow platelets
   .
   5.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].  Only able to drain a few ccs
   from parapharyngeal and masticator space.
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery
   -          drain removal tomorrow
   6.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   7.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a chief complaint of septic shock. She has a likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.7°C, HR 51 bpm, BP 133/70 mmHg, RR 27 breaths/min, SpO2 91%
* Neurological exam: Right ptosis and dilated pupil, with some odd behavior, but able to recognize family and have meaningful conversations, oriented
* Cardiovascular: Sinus rhythm, no acute distress
* Respiratory: Requiring less and less ventilator support, likely to be extubated today
* Renal: Pre-renal acute kidney injury (ARF) is resolving, but will require close monitoring
* Hematology: Thrombocytopenia, but platelets are stable, and DIC is being managed with anticoagulation and platelet transfusions

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic emboli: The patient has already been found to have septic emboli on chest CT, and there is concern for left and right-sided infarction.
* Elevated intracranial pressure: The patient has an opening pressure of 51 mmHg on lumbar puncture, and there is concern for worsening ICP.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring some ventilator support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator is discontinued too quickly.
* Renal failure: The patient has pre-renal ARF, and there is a risk of worsening renal function if the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled.
* Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, and there is a risk of sepsis if the infection is not adequately treated.
* DIC: The patient has DIC, and there is a risk of bleeding if the anticoagulation is not managed properly.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Anticoagulation with heparin to prevent further thrombus formation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the GNR bacteremia
* Monitoring of the patient's neurological exam and platelet count
* Serial laboratory tests to monitor the patient's response to treatment
* Consideration of MRI with gadolinium to further evaluate the patient's condition
* Follow-up with the patient's primary care physician and other specialists as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: septic shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cultures still pending.
   - Heparin gtt continued (increased to 1200), platelets greater than
   100.
   - Neuro recs: MRI to further eval area with concern for abscess;
   holding off on but potentially will schedule today (not yet ordered).
   - Neurosurg recs: no intervention planned.
   - ID recs: increased vanco to 1500 Q12, rec d/c acyclovir (not yet
   done, HSV PCR still pending).
   - OMFS recs: will likely remove drain today.
   - ENT swabbed middle turbinates, sent for culture.  Also recommended
   Afrin x 3 days and saline nasal rinse [**Hospital1 7**] (not yet in)
   - Given lack of interventions planned; sedation changed to propofol,
   lightened and extubated.
   - Following extubation, cranial nerve exam with little change from
   prior.  Some ?delerium - slighly odd behavior; but able to recognize
   family and have meaningful conversations, oriented.  Cranial nerve
   findings unchanged.  Ptosis with slight eye opening.  R pupil with
   efferent deficit, stills seems unable to move R eye in any direction
   but laterally, gross visual acuity intact (does report blurriness).
   Peripheral strength exam intact.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including the administration of vancomycin, heparin, and propofol. The patient's cranial nerve exam shows little change from prior, with ptosis and a fixed pupil on the right side. The patient's peripheral strength exam is intact.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is also impaired, with elevated levels of AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase.

The patient's radiology results show a possible abscess in the area of concern, and the patient's neurosurgeon has recommended further evaluation with an MRI. The patient's ID specialist has recommended increasing the dose of vancomycin and discontinuing acyclovir.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 94 and an ABG result of 7.43/34/94. The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and is on standby ventilator mode.

The patient's physical examination shows a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. The patient's eyes are normal, but the right pupil is fixed with minimal constriction. The patient's head, ears, nose, and throat examination shows some dried blood in the oropharynx.

The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2 heart sound. The patient's peripheral vascular examination shows a normal radial pulse on the left side, but the right radial pulse is not assessed. The patient's respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds.

The patient's abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities show a 1+ edema on the right side and a 1+ edema on the left side.

The patient's skin examination shows no rash. The patient's neurologic examination shows an attentive individual who responds to stimuli, but the patient's movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, and lactate. The patient's albumin level is low, and the patient's LDH level is elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired health maintenance, altered mental status, severe sepsis, fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cavernous sinus thrombosis, shock, other, meningitis, other, renal failure, acute, and respiratory failure, acute.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC [**Hospital1 **] (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: septic shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cultures still pending.
   - Heparin gtt continued (increased to 1200), platelets greater than
   100.
   - Neuro recs: MRI to further eval area with concern for abscess;
   holding off on but potentially will schedule today (not yet ordered).
   - Neurosurg recs: no intervention planned.
   - ID recs: increased vanco to 1500 Q12, rec d/c acyclovir (not yet
   done, HSV PCR still pending).
   - OMFS recs: will likely remove drain today.
   - ENT swabbed middle turbinates, sent for culture.  Also recommended
   Afrin x 3 days and saline nasal rinse [**Hospital1 7**] (not yet in)
   - Given lack of interventions planned; sedation changed to propofol,
   lightened and extubated.
   - Following extubation, cranial nerve exam with little change from
   prior.  Some ?delerium - slighly odd behavior; but able to recognize
   family and have meaningful conversations, oriented.  Cranial nerve
   findings unchanged.  Ptosis with slight eye opening.  R pupil with
   efferent deficit, stills seems unable to move R eye in any direction
   but laterally, gross visual acuity intact (does report blurriness).
   Peripheral strength exam intact.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC [**Hospital1 **] (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.
   - let her set I/O goal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.
   - let her set I/O goal

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a goal to wean off ventilation soon.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation with IV heparin has been initiated to prevent further thrombosis.
* Neurological: The patient has a cavernous sinus thrombosis with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, and is receiving anticoagulation and dexamethasone to manage this condition.
* Hematological: The patient has DIC, which is being managed with supportive care and monitoring of lab values.
* Renal: The patient has renal failure, which is being managed with IV hydration and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
* Infectious: The patient has a GNR bacteremia and meningitis, which is being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypoglycemia, which is being managed with a regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus rhythm is currently stable, but there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias developing due to the patient's underlying condition and medication use.
* Sepsis: The patient has a GNR bacteremia and meningitis, which can lead to sepsis if not managed properly.
* DIC: The patient has DIC, which can lead to bleeding and organ failure if not managed properly.
* Renal failure: The patient already has renal failure, which can worsen if not managed properly.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient has hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological damage if not managed properly.
* Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient has a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the GNR bacteremia and meningitis
* Anticoagulation with IV heparin to prevent further thrombosis
* Dexamethasone to manage the cavernous sinus thrombosis
* Supportive care to manage the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological complications
* IV hydration and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to manage the patient's renal failure
* Regular insulin sliding scale to manage the patient's hypoglycemia
* Monitoring of lab values to track the patient's response to treatment and identify any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
     >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: presumed fusobacterium) and meningeal
   inflammation. She currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the
   right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN
   conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic
   process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover
   infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will
   cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently
   being anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input), likely to remove drain today. Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV
   is neg and we will stop the Acyclovir [**12-31**].
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr. Favor I/E goal even, but will not give lasix
   today.
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system: prelim info is fusobacterium)
   - discuss with Neurosurgery re: timing of repeat MRI. Per Neurosurg
   team there is no plan for intervention based on current lesion location
   and size.
   >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and doing well. Would favor running I/O goal even if possible
   - Pulm toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. Her fibrinogen of late is trending down,
   however plts and coags are stable.  We will cont to follow very
   closely, concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and sepsis, which is concerning for an anaerobic process (fusobacterium).
2. Meningeal inflammation and possible anaerobic process in the brain.
3. DIC, which is likely related to her evolving GNR bacteremia and meningitis.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia due to DIC.
6. Renal failure, initially pre-renal, but now resolved.
7. Sinusitis, which is being managed conservatively with antibiotics and nasal saline.
8. Swallowing function, which needs to be evaluated by a speech-language pathologist.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin, and is being anticoagulated with IV heparin. She is also receiving supportive care, including diuretics and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progression of septicemia and septic shock.
2. Development of further thrombotic complications, such as pulmonary emboli or stroke.
3. Worsening of DIC, leading to bleeding or organ failure.
4. Respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli.
5. Renal failure or worsening of existing renal impairment.
6. Sinusitis or other secondary infections.
7. Swallowing dysfunction or aspiration.
8. Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.

The patient's care requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical condition, with a multidisciplinary team approach involving intensivists, infectious disease specialists, neurologists, and other specialists."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
     >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: presumed fusobacterium) and meningeal
   inflammation. She currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the
   right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN
   conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic
   process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover
   infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will
   cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently
   being anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input), likely to remove drain today. Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV
   is neg and we will stop the Acyclovir [**12-31**].
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr. Favor I/E goal even, but will not give lasix
   today.
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system: prelim info is fusobacterium)
   - discuss with Neurosurgery re: timing of repeat MRI. Per Neurosurg
   team there is no plan for intervention based on current lesion location
   and size.
   >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and doing well. Would favor running I/O goal even if possible
   - Pulm toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. Her fibrinogen of late is trending down,
   however plts and coags are stable.  We will cont to follow very
   closely, concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
    > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: Extubated and doing well, with a SpO2 of 91% on nasal cannula.
* Cardiovascular: Stable, with a blood pressure of 133/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 51 beats per minute.
* Neurological: Alert and oriented, with some right eyelid movement and vision intact. Pupil constricted, with V1/2 hypoesthesia.
* Hematological: Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 46.
* Renal: Previously pre-renal, but now resolved.
* Gastrointestinal: Soft, non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.3
* Hematocrit: 24.3
* Platelet count: 46
* Creatinine: 1.1
* Glucose: 184

* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 273 IU/L
* CXR: Increasing density consistent with septic pulmonary emboli.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin, to cover the suspected anaerobic process.
* Anti-coagulation with IV heparin to treat DIC, with a goal aPTT of 50-60.
* Supportive care for hypoxemic respiratory failure, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
* Conservative management of sinusitis with affrin and NS nasal, broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Evaluation of swallowing function by a speech-language pathologist.
* Follow-up of DIC labs, including platelet count, INR, and fibrinogen levels.
* Gentle diuresis to manage fluid balance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to septic pulmonary emboli
* Meningitis due to GNR bacteremia
* Cavernous sinus thrombosis with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe
* DIC with bleeding complications
* Renal failure due to inadequate perfusion
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and sepsis:
	* Risk of worsening sepsis, meningitis, and cerebral edema
	* Potential for increased intracranial pressure and potential for herniation
2. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation):
	* Risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and pulmonary hemorrhage
	* Potential for organ failure, including kidney, liver, and lung failure
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
     >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: presumed fusobacterium) and meningeal
   inflammation. She currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the
   right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN
   conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic
   process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover
   infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will
   cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently
   being anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input), likely to remove drain today. Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV
   is neg and we will stop the Acyclovir [**12-31**].
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr. Favor I/E goal even, but will not give lasix
   today.
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system: prelim info is fusobacterium)
   - discuss with Neurosurgery re: timing of repeat MRI. Per Neurosurg
   team there is no plan for intervention based on current lesion location
   and size.
   >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and doing well. Would favor running I/O goal even if possible
   - Pulm toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. Her fibrinogen of late is trending down,
   however plts and coags are stable.  We will cont to follow very
   closely, concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
    > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: will contact SLP to eval swallowing function.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   data (now in our system: prelim info is fusobacterium)
   - discuss with Neurosurgery re: timing of repeat MRI. Per Neurosurg
   team there is no plan for intervention based on current lesion location
   and size.
   >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and doing well. Would favor running I/O goal even if possible
   - Pulm toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. Her fibrinogen of late is trending down,
   however plts and coags are stable.  We will cont to follow very
   closely, concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
    > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: will contact SLP to eval swallowing function.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female who was admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle, and has been extubated.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple medical complications:

1. Sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and sepsis: The patient has a confirmed GNR bacteremia and meningitis, which is complicated by a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, which is a potential complication of her GNR bacteremia.
3. DIC/Anemia: The patient has DIC physiology with elevated INR, pTT (mild), and decreased platelets, with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
4. Renal failure: The patient initially had pre-renal renal failure, but it has resolved.
5. Sinusitis: The patient has sinusitis, which is being managed conservatively with Afrin and NS nasal spray, as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.7-12.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.0-8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 84-161 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22-28 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+ 145 mmol/L, K+ 3.8 mmol/L, Cl- 116 mmol/L, PO4 3.5 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.8 mg/dL
* Coagulation studies: PT 21.3 seconds, PTT 57.4 seconds, INR 2.0

The patient is receiving antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin, as well as anticoagulation therapy with heparin. She is also receiving supportive care, including fluid management, nutrition, and glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).
   - Plan for repeat MRI with gad (as soon as she can tolerate from a resp
   standpoint)
   - Steroid taper (cut dose to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and with slightly increased O2 requirement and a worsening
   CXR (consistent with volume), there are definite septic emboli which
   are also likely contributing to V/Q mismatch.
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair,
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive.  We will cont to follow very closely,
   concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
    >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
   -  follow electrolytes closely
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and
   advance as tolerate

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).
   - Plan for repeat MRI with gad (as soon as she can tolerate from a resp
   standpoint)
   - Steroid taper (cut dose to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and with slightly increased O2 requirement and a worsening
   CXR (consistent with volume), there are definite septic emboli which
   are also likely contributing to V/Q mismatch.
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair,
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive.  We will cont to follow very closely,
   concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
    >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
   -  follow electrolytes closely
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and
   advance as tolerate

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female who was admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous sinus thrombosis complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on December 30.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, which is likely contributing to V/Q mismatch. She is currently extubated and requires slightly increased O2.
* Cardiovascular: She has DIC physiology with elevated INR, pTT (mild), and decreased platelets with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
* Neurological: She has cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, which is concerning for an anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium).
* Infectious: She has GNR bacteremia and meningeal inflammation, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli
* Progression of DIC, leading to bleeding or thrombotic events
* Development of septic shock due to GNR bacteremia and meningeal inflammation
* Complications related to cavernous sinus thrombosis, such as stroke or cerebral edema
* Renal failure due to pre-renal or intrinsic kidney damage
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
* Infectious complications, such as meningitis or sepsis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin) to cover GNR bacteremia and meningeal inflammation
* Anticoagulation with IV heparin to prevent thrombotic events
* Supportive care for respiratory failure, including O2 therapy and pulmonary toilet
* Monitoring of DIC lab results to adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed
* Close follow-up of electrolytes and renal function to prevent complications
* Conservative management of sinusitis and swallowing function
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  Respiratory distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  Respiratory distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

Summary:

The patient, an 18-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis, likely caused by an odontogenic infection. The patient has been experiencing septic emboli, DIC, and respiratory distress. The patient's blood cultures have grown Fusobacterium, and she has been started on antibiotics, including Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. The patient's INR is rising, and she has been given vitamin K for three days. The patient's platelet count is improving, and she has been taken off of platelet transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: The patient's condition is life-threatening, and there is a risk of further complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, and death.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is still low, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is a risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to treat the patient's septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust platelet transfusions as necessary.
4. Consider repeating imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI, to evaluate for any changes in the patient's condition.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac status and potential cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch-tall individual with a chief complaint of cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient has been experiencing worsening multifocal opacities on their chest X-ray, which is compatible with progressive infection.

The patient's laboratory results show increasing fibrin split products, stable fibrinogen, and rising INR, indicating a possible development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has been fluctuating, with a range of 9.7-12.5, while their hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable, ranging from 24.2-25.5. The patient's platelet count (Plt) has been increasing, ranging from 84-161.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 67 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 144/77 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right pupil non-reactive, dilated, and irregular
* Right eye can move laterally (abduct) only
* Right V1 & V2 numbness
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Absent right and left radial pulses
* Absent right and left digital pulses
* Scattered crackles in the chest, greatest at the bases

The patient's medical history and allergies are as follows:

* No known drug allergies
* Last dose of antibiotics: Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Progressive infection: The worsening multifocal opacities on the patient's chest X-ray indicate a possible progression of the infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The increasing fibrin split products and rising INR suggest a possible development of DIC, which can lead to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
3. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's condition is already complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to stroke, seizures, or other neurological complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen. This may indicate a risk of respiratory failure or worsening respiratory distress.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and they have absent radial and digital pulses, which may indicate a risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly to address any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, an 18-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis, likely caused by an odontogenic infection, and GNR bacteremia, likely caused by Fusobacterium. The patient has a history of dental extraction and was found to have septic emboli on chest CT, consistent with the diagnosis of Lemierres. She has also been diagnosed with DIC, which is improving, and has undergone dental extraction and drain removal.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C
* Heart rate: 67 bpm
* Blood pressure: 144/77 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Glasgow Coma Scale: Not assessed

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Right ptosis and dilated pupil
* Right eye can move laterally (abduct) only
* Right V1 and V2 numbness
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Absent peripheral pulses
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen and lasix 10 IV

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 9.7-12.5 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 25.2-25.5%
* Plt: 84-161 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-23 mmHg
* Glucose: 100-179 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 21.3/57.4/2.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 40/29/0.9 ng/mL, ALT/AST: 28/29 IU/L, Alk Phos/T Bili: 73/1.6 mg/dL, Differential-Neuts: 91.6%, Band: 2.0%, Lymph: 6.2%, Mono: 2.0%, Eos: 0.1%, D-dimer: 3509 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 235 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.3 g/dL, LDH: 273 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock and multi-organ failure due to septic emboli and DIC
2. Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to septic emboli and DIC
3. Neurological deterioration and increased intracranial pressure due to septic emboli and DIC
4. Renal failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to pre-renal ARF and septic emboli
5. Coagulopathy and bleeding due to DIC and anticoagulation therapy
6. Infection and sepsis due to ongoing dental infection and septic emboli
7. Cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrhythmias due to septic shock and DIC
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding and gastrointestinal perforation due to septic emboli and DIC

Based on the patient's condition, the following treatment plan is recommended:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent thrombus formation and extension
2. Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam closely and consider serial LPs if there is evidence of worsening ICP
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential pathogens and consider switching to Ceftriaxone/Flagyl as recommended by ID
4. Monitor platelet count and transfuse platelets if < 50
5. Continue respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and consider intubation if necessary
6. Monitor renal function and consider fluid boluses for low urine output
7. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI and consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with histamine-2 receptor antagonists
8. Monitor for signs of septic shock and multi-organ failure and consider vasopressor support if necessary
9. Consider re-imaging chest CT to evaluate evolution of septic emboli and potential new lesions
10. Consider serial LPs to monitor for worsening ICP and consider surgical intervention if necessary."

   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis with septic emboli and sepsis syndrome. She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. 

The patient's current condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and sinusitis. She is being treated with antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin, and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with IV heparin to target an aPTT of 50-60. 

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DIC, with a platelet count of 108 K/uL and an INR of 1.7. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and she has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further progression of DIC, leading to bleeding or thrombotic events.
2. Respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis syndrome, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Sinusitis, which can lead to further complications such as meningitis or abscesses.
5. Vitamin K deficiency, which can worsen bleeding complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies, potentially leading to poor wound healing or further complications.
7. Potential for further septic emboli, leading to further complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with cavernous sinus thrombosis, septic emboli, and sepsis syndrome. The patient has undergone several interventions, including removal of tooth #1, exploration of the pterygoid muscle, and extubation.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with GNR bacteremia and sepsis: The patient has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, which is concerning for an anaerobic process (fusobacterium). The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, which are contributing to V/Q mismatch. The patient is extubated and requires slightly increased O2 support.
3. DIC/Anemia: The patient has DIC physiology with elevated INR, PTT (mild), and decreased platelets with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The patient's care is supportive, and the team is concerned about the evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is being anticoagulated with IV heparin, with a goal aPTT of 50-60.
5. Renal failure: The patient initially had pre-renal renal failure, which has resolved. The team will continue to follow electrolytes closely.
6. Sinusitis: The patient has conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ENT input.
7. Swallowing function: The patient has mechanical ground and advance as tolerated, with SLP input.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further progression of cavernous sinus thrombosis, leading to worsening sepsis and potential neurological deficits.
2. Development of respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Worsening DIC/Anemia, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Renal failure, requiring dialysis.
5. Infection-related complications, such as septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.
6. Neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or meningitis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: Metronidazole, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin.
2. Anticoagulation: IV heparin, with a goal aPTT of 50-60.
3. Repeat MRI with gadolinium as soon as the patient can tolerate it.
4. Steroid taper: Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h.
5. Pulmonary toilet: OOB to chair.
6. Goal net out 500 cc to 1L.
7. Follow-up lab tests: DIC, INR, PTT, platelets, fibrinogen, and FDP.
8. Nutritional support: Glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and management."

   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with

   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specific
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia. She has a cavernous sinus thrombosis complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and sepsis. The patient has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, anticoagulation, and steroids.

The patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for several potential complications, including:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's condition is complicated by a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to further complications such as meningitis, seizures, and stroke.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis syndrome is ongoing, and she is at risk for further complications such as organ failure, septic shock, and death.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC is ongoing, and she is at risk for further complications such as bleeding, organ failure, and death.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral septic pulmonary emboli and volume overload are causing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
5. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy is increasing her risk of bleeding, particularly if her platelet count drops below 50,000.
6. Vitamin K deficiency: The patient's vitamin K deficiency may be related to her nutritional deficiency or her use of anticoagulation therapy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
7. Sinusitis: The patient's sinusitis is ongoing, and she is at risk for further complications such as meningitis, abscess formation, and chronic sinusitis.
8. Swallowing dysfunction: The patient's swallowing dysfunction may lead to aspiration, pneumonia, and other respiratory complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover her anaerobic infection.
2. Anticoagulation therapy with IV heparin to prevent further thrombus formation.
3. Steroids to reduce inflammation and swelling.
4. Diuresis to manage her volume overload.
5. Repeat MRI to monitor her cavernous sinus thrombosis.
6. PICC placement to facilitate future antibiotic administration.
7. Steroid taper to reduce her steroid dosage.
8. Follow-up with the ID team to monitor her infection and adjust her antibiotic regimen as necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cavernous venous thrombosis. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has received various treatments, including anticoagulation therapy with heparin, antibiotics, and diuretics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 44 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/79 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 269 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 29 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 28 IU/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and mild liver enzyme elevation suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of ARDS.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury.

   Assessment and Plan
 In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis,
   Fusobacterium bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr
   (recheck this AM)
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Eepeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it (will attempt)
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis,
   Fusobacterium bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr
   (recheck this AM)
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Eepeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it (will attempt)
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is complicated by septic emboli, thrombocytopenia, and potential temporal lobe abscess.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure due to septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to neurological deterioration and even death.
2. Further development of septic emboli, which can result in organ failure and death.
3. Progression of DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications, organ failure, and death.
4. Development of a temporal lobe abscess, which can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and death.
5. Respiratory failure due to septic emboli and fluid overload, which can require mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and cardiac failure due to septic emboli and DIC.
7. Renal failure due to septic emboli and DIC, which can require dialysis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and ileus due to septic emboli and DIC.
9. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization.

The patient is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, antibiotics, and diuretics, and is being closely monitored for neurological and respiratory deterioration. The patient's platelet count is improving, and DIC labs are being serially monitored. The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and is being monitored for signs of delirium.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  [**Known lastname **] distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  [**Known lastname **] distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient is currently receiving anticoagulation with heparin for thrombus with a goal PTT of 50-60. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being closely monitored for neurological and mental status changes.

The patient has a history of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, which has resulted in right ptosis and dilated pupil. She is at risk for further complications, including:

1. Septic emboli: The patient has already developed septic emboli on chest CT, which is consistent with the diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome. She is at risk for further septic emboli and potential systemic lesions.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has thrombocytopenia and DIC, which is improving, but still requires close monitoring and potential transfusion.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has been fluid-positive for several days and is experiencing increased shortness of breath. She is at risk for further fluid overload and potential complications.
4. Temporal lobe abscess: The patient has a history of possible temporal lobe abscess, which requires further evaluation and potential intervention.
5. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which is likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional deficiency. She requires close monitoring and potential treatment.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and neurologists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cavernous venous thrombosis. The patient has been receiving various medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 51 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show:

* Platelet count: 310,000/μL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 14.4 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 135 mg/dL
* Other labs: elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, with normal or near-normal levels of other electrolytes.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including:

* Sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction
* Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cavernous sinus thrombosis
* Shock, other
* Meningitis, other
* Renal failure, acute
* Respiratory failure, acute

The patient's care plan includes:

* Systemic anticoagulation with heparin
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* Monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Further progression of cavernous sinus thrombosis, leading to increased risk of stroke, seizures, or other neurological deficits
* Development of respiratory failure, leading to increased risk of mortality
* Progression of renal failure, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances and other complications
* Development of septic shock, leading to increased risk of mortality
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leading to increased risk of mortality and morbidity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, who is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cavernous venous thrombosis. The patient has undergone various imaging and laboratory tests, including MRI with gadolinium, which showed no well-demarcated abscess.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 51 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's neurological exam is stable, with no changes in mental status or level of consciousness.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Platelet count: 310,000/μL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.5 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L
* Chloride: 103 mmol/L
* Glucose: 148 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* LDH: 326 IU/L
* D-dimer: 3509 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 278 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin, pantoprazole, and metronidazole. The patient is also receiving IV fluids and has a central line and peripheral lines in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's cavernous venous thrombosis.
2. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated D-dimer levels.
3. Renal failure due to the patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
4. Respiratory failure due to the patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Infection due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein levels.
6. Hemorrhage due to the patient's coagulopathy and elevated fibrinogen levels.
7. Neurological complications due to the patient's cavernous sinus thrombosis and elevated intracranial pressure.
8. Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely odontogenic infection
   resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and
   DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr
   (recheck this AM)
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Eepeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it (will attempt)
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely odontogenic infection
   resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and
   DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr
   (recheck this AM)
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Eepeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it (will attempt)
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

Summary:

The patient, an 18-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for cavernous venous thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been diagnosed with septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is being treated with anticoagulation therapy and antibiotics. The patient is also being treated for possible temporal lobe abscess, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, and DIC. She has been experiencing delirium, which has improved significantly.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is at risk for further neurological deterioration, including brain edema, herniation, and death.
2. Temporal lobe abscess: If left untreated, the abscess could rupture and lead to cerebral edema, herniation, and death.
3. DIC: The patient is at risk for further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral bleeding, and renal failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral bleeding, and renal failure.
5. Septic emboli: The patient is at risk for further septic emboli, which could lead to organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
6. Delirium: The patient is at risk for further delirium, which could lead to confusion, agitation, and aggression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent further thrombus formation and reduce the risk of septic emboli.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological exam and mental status exam closely to detect any signs of neurological deterioration.
3. Consider imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, to monitor for any signs of abscess or bleeding.
4. Continue antibiotics to treat the patient's bacteremia and septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and INR to detect any signs of bleeding or coagulation disorders.
6. Consider consulting with neurology, neurosurgery, and hematology to optimize the patient's care and management.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient should be maintained on a regular diet to prevent malnutrition and maintain caloric intake.
2. Glycemic control: The patient should be maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient should have a multi-lumen central venous catheter and a peripheral IV line to facilitate medication administration and monitoring.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI to prevent GI bleeding.
5. VAP: The patient should be monitored for VAP and receive prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
6. Communication: The patient's family should be informed of her condition and treatment plan, and her code status should be discussed with her family and healthcare team."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely odontogenic infection
   resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and
   DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Repeat MRI done yesterday; no evidence of intraparenchymal
   abscess, followup on final read.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely odontogenic infection
   resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and
   DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Repeat MRI done yesterday; no evidence of intraparenchymal
   abscess, followup on final read.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's condition remains stable, with no significant changes in her neurological exam. She continues to receive anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent further thrombus formation. Her platelet count has improved significantly, and her fibrinogen levels are stable.

The patient's respiratory status remains stable, with no acute distress and a SpO2 of 96%. She is receiving oxygen therapy, but the device is not specified.

The patient's laboratory results show a prolonged PT/PTT/INR, elevated D-dimer, and rising INR, indicating ongoing DIC. Her lactate levels are within normal range, and her albumin levels are slightly decreased.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's neurological exam remains stable, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in her neurological status.
2. DIC: The patient's platelet count has improved, but her INR remains elevated. Close monitoring of her laboratory results and platelet count is necessary to detect any changes in her coagulation status.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved, but it is still below normal range. Close monitoring of her platelet count is necessary to detect any changes in her thrombocytopenia.
4. Renal infarct: The patient's chest CT scan showed evidence of septic emboli, and a renal infarct is a potential complication. Close monitoring of her renal function is necessary to detect any changes in her kidney function.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved significantly, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in her mental status.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent further thrombus formation.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological exam and mental status exam closely.
3. Taper dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, pending ID/neuro recs.
4. Repeat MRI with gadolinium to rule out intraparenchymal abscess.
5. Consider MRI with gadolinium today to rule out temporal lobe abscess.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Continue IV lasix prn to manage fluid overload.
8. Monitor the patient's platelet count and laboratory results to detect any changes in her coagulation status.
9. Continue vitamin K therapy for 3 days to manage DIC.
10. Appreciate ID, neurology, and neurosurgery recs for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. The patient's platelet count has improved, and her INR is stable. However, her fibrinogen levels are elevated, and her FDP levels are still high. She has been receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and has been diagnosed with septic emboli, including a possible renal infarct. The patient's neurological exam has been stable, and she has been able to follow commands and respond to stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's condition can worsen if the thrombosis progresses or if there is a recurrence of the infection.
2. DIC: The patient's DIC can worsen if her platelet count drops further or if her fibrinogen levels become more elevated.
3. Septic emboli: The patient's septic emboli can lead to further complications, such as organ infarction or failure.
4. Renal infarct: The patient's renal infarct can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms can worsen if she develops pneumonia.
6. Worsening of neurological symptoms: The patient's neurological symptoms can worsen if the thrombosis progresses or if there is a recurrence of the infection.
7. Infection of the central nervous system: The patient is at risk of developing an infection of the central nervous system, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy can lead to bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or epistaxis.
9. Thrombotic complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy can lead to thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
10. Organ failure: The patient's septic emboli can lead to organ failure, such as respiratory failure, cardiac failure, or hepatic failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) complicated by DIC. The patient has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: The patient has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, which is concerning for an anaerobic process (fusobacterium).
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral septic pulmonary emboli and volume overload, which has improved significantly with diuresis.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient is being anticoagulated with IV heparin, with a goal aPTT of 50-60, to reduce the risk of further thrombosis and improve outcomes.
4. Sinusitis: The patient has a conservative management plan for sinusitis, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and nasal decongestants.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis may lead to cerebral edema, which can worsen neurological symptoms.
2. Seizures: The patient's cerebral edema and meningitis may increase the risk of seizures.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral septic pulmonary emboli may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and sepsis may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
5. DIC: The patient's DIC may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Cerebral hemorrhage: The patient's anticoagulation may increase the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.
7. Renal failure: The patient's volume overload and sepsis may lead to renal failure.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover anaerobic and aerobic pathogens.
2. Anticoagulation with IV heparin to reduce the risk of further thrombosis.
3. Steroid taper to reduce inflammation.
4. Pulmonary toilet to improve respiratory function.
5. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Regular assessment of neurological function and potential complications.
7. Consideration of PICC placement for further antibiotic administration.
8. Discharge planning to a floor bed once the patient's condition improves."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) complicated by DIC, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and meningeal inflammation. She underwent removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle, and was extubated on 12/30. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Metronidazole, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin) and anticoagulation with IV heparin to achieve an aPTT of 50-60. She is also receiving dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Her neurological examination reveals a diminished but present response to light in the right pupil, and paresthesia of the trigeminal nerve (lip and upper right side).

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged PTT and INR. Her renal function is normal, and her liver function tests are mildly elevated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with potential extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, leading to meningitis, brain abscess, or seizures.
2. Bacteremia with potential spread to other organs, such as the kidneys, liver, or spleen.
3. DIC with potential bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, epistaxis, or hematuria.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure with potential progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Volume overload with potential cardiac complications, such as congestive heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Anticoagulation-related bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or epistaxis.
7. Neurological complications, such as seizures, meningitis, or brain abscess, due to the patient's underlying condition or treatment.

The patient's plan includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation with IV heparin, and dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient will also receive a planned 5-week course of antibiotics, and will be considered for PICC line placement. The patient's nutritional needs will be met with a regular diet, and her glycemic control will be monitored with RISS."

   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specific
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present). - Plan for

   >DIC: PLT improving
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
   - Started vitamin K
    >Anticoagulation: anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K , INR<2.5

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
   - Started vitamin K
    >Anticoagulation: anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K , INR<2.5
   then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and
   advance as tolerate

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia, complicated by cavernous sinus thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has undergone removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device not in use, SpO2 96%, ABG: //25/
* Cardiovascular: Sinus bradycardia, blood pressure 119/64 mmHg
* Neurological: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to x3, movement purposeful, tone not assessed
* Laboratory results: WBC 10.4-14.6, Hct 25.2-28.4, Plt 108-161, Cr 0.7-1.0, Glucose 135-206 mg/dL, other lab results as listed
* Medications: Heparin sodium, pantoprazole, metronidazole, ceftriaxone, dexamethasone

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and sepsis, which can lead to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
2. DIC: The patient has ongoing DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications, organ failure, and death.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral septic pulmonary emboli and volume overload, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Vitamin K deficiency: The patient's INR is rising, which can be related to heparin or nutritional deficiency (Vit K).
6. Sinusitis: The patient has sinusitis, which can lead to complications such as meningitis, abscess formation, and sinus perforation.
7. Swallowing dysfunction: The patient has swallowing function issues, which can lead to aspiration, pneumonia, and death.
8. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient has ongoing cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can lead to complications such as meningitis, abscess formation, and sinus perforation.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for GNR bacteremia and sinusitis
* Anticoagulation with IV heparin for DIC and cavernous sinus thrombosis
* Steroid taper for cavernous sinus thrombosis
* Repeat MRI to monitor cavernous sinus thrombosis
* Pulmonary toilet to improve oxygenation
* Vitamin K supplementation to prevent bleeding complications
* Swallowing therapy to improve swallowing function
* ICU care to monitor and manage the patient's condition."
