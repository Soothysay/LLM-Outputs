   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Did diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on floor. Will
   treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given recent
   hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in ascitic fluid
   given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs, 93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**]
   RBCs. Consistent with SBP.  Given history of diarrhea as well will send
   stool for C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other
   infectious eitologies. Was receiving aggressive fluid rehydration which
   does not appear to have improved his clinical picture at all and
   patient not currently hypotensive; additionally, CXR this AM consistent
   with mild pulmonary edema.
   - D/c IVF, if hypotensive will plan to reinstitute volume repletion
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   -HCT q4 hours
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Kayexelate given x2. In the
   setting of oliguria will consult renal as hyperkalemia may be an
   indication for dialysis in this patient.
   -Kayexelate
   -K+ q4 hours
   -Renal consult
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. [**Month (only) 11**] be because patient has no hepatic
   function to clear lactate. Also could possibly be secondary to bowel
   ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet perforated,
   but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this morning from
   exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely,
   will continue to follow
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose. Not improving with aggressive fluids, making
   hepatorenal higher on differential.
   -Consult renal, may need dialysis
   -D/c IVF as above given pulmonary edema
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening (Doppler,
   ect)
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   .
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   .
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Giving calcium for hyperkalemia
   #Hyponatremic: Patient appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving.
   -Make sure medications given in saline not water
   -Once no longer NPO consider free water restriction
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Renagel TID
   .
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen: Lactulose
   -Pain management
   ACCESS: PIV's, Right femoral line; right femoral line will need to be
   pulled today, will c/s renal first to see if they would like access for
   CVVH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high suspicion of sepsis given his tachycardia, elevated WBC count, and lactate levels. The likely source of sepsis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given his recent peritoneal catheter and lack of SBP prophylaxis.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a strong suspicion of variceal bleed given his history of ESLD and orthostasis. The bleeding is likely slow given the patient's history of bleeding over several days.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated K+ levels, which may be an indication for dialysis given his oliguria.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which may be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, bowel ischemia, or lack of hepatic function to clear lactate.
5. Oliguria: The patient has decreased urine output despite aggressive fluid rehydration, which may be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or sepsis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be due to acute worsening of his chronic ESLD or malnutrition.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant and has a high MELD score.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is being managed with paracentesis and diuretics.
9. DM: The patient is currently NPO and has no insulin regimen in place.
10. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive and is holding his home medications.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient is receiving calcium for hyperkalemia.
13. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to volume depletion and is being managed with saline replacement.
14. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosphatemia, which is being managed with Renagel.

The patient is currently being managed with aggressive fluid rehydration, antibiotics, and supportive care. He is being monitored closely for signs of deterioration and is awaiting further evaluation and management for his various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Did diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on floor. Will
   treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given recent
   hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in ascitic fluid
   given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs, 93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**]
   RBCs. Consistent with SBP.  Given history of diarrhea as well will send
   stool for C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other
   infectious eitologies. Was receiving aggressive fluid rehydration which
   does not appear to have improved his clinical picture at all and
   patient not currently hypotensive; additionally, CXR this AM consistent
   with mild pulmonary edema.
   - D/c IVF, if hypotensive will plan to reinstitute volume repletion
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and oliguria. He has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding for several days, which is suspected to be a variceal bleed. He has also developed hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care, but his condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. He is at risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern, as it can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and coagulopathy.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria can lead to acute kidney injury, which can further exacerbate his metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.
7. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's hepatorenal syndrome can lead to acute kidney injury and require dialysis.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can lead to decreased immune function, increased risk of infections, and decreased tolerance to medications.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections.
10. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is compromised due to his septic shock, and he is at risk of developing cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and vasopressors as prescribed.
3. Consider transfusing blood products, including platelets and plasma, to correct the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
4. Consider dialysis to treat the patient's oliguria and metabolic acidosis.
5. Consider referring the patient to a transplant center for further evaluation and treatment.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist, gastroenterologist, and intensivist to optimize the patient's care.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if necessary.
8. Consider administering stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis as prescribed.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider administering sedatives and analgesics as needed.
10. Consider consulting with a social worker to evaluate the patient's suitability for transplant and to provide support to the patient and his family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Did diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on floor. Will
   treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given recent
   hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in ascitic fluid
   given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs, 93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**]
   RBCs. Consistent with SBP.  Given history of diarrhea as well will send
   stool for C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other
   infectious eitologies. Was receiving aggressive fluid rehydration which
   does not appear to have improved his clinical picture at all and
   patient not currently hypotensive; additionally, CXR this AM consistent
   with mild pulmonary edema.
   - D/c IVF, if hypotensive will plan to reinstitute volume repletion
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   -HCT q4 hours
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Kayexelate given x2. In the
   setting of oliguria will consult renal as hyperkalemia may be an
   indication for dialysis in this patient.
   -Kayexelate
   -K+ q4 hours
   -Renal consult
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. [**Month (only) 11**] be because patient has no hepatic
   function to clear lactate. Also could possibly be secondary to bowel
   ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet perforated,
   but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this morning from
   exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely,
   will continue to follow
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose. Not improving with aggressive fluids, making
   hepatorenal higher on differential.
   -Consult renal, may need dialysis
   -D/c IVF as above given pulmonary edema
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening (Doppler,
   ect)
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachypnea, and elevated lactate levels indicate sepsis. The most likely source is SBP given the patient's history of peritoneal catheter placement. Empiric antibiotic treatment has been initiated, and the patient is being monitored closely.
2. GI Bleed: The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis and melena, which suggests a GI bleed. The most likely source is variceal bleed given the patient's history of ESLD and EtOH abuse. The patient's HCT trended down from admission, which may be due to dilutional anemia.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are significantly elevated, and the EKG shows no evidence of cardiac instability. The patient is receiving calcium for membrane stabilization, and Kayexelate has been given twice. The patient's renal function is being monitored closely, and dialysis may be necessary.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and the metabolic acidosis is not improving despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient's liver function is impaired, which may contribute to the metabolic acidosis. A CT scan with PO contrast is being ordered to evaluate for bowel ischemia.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has not significantly increased despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and the FENa is 0.29%, which is consistent with prerenal azotemia. The patient is being monitored closely, and dialysis may be necessary.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which may represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. The patient is receiving FFP, and vitamin K is being considered for procedures.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant, and the liver team is following his case.
8. Ascites: The patient is currently hypotensive, and his ascites is being monitored closely. Spirololactone and Lasix are being held.
9. DM: The patient is currently NPO, and insulin therapy is being considered.
10. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive, and his home medications are being held.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin levels are low, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are being monitored closely, and repletion is being done as needed.
13. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be due to volume depletion. The patient is being monitored closely, and free water restriction is being considered once he is no longer NPO.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple complications, including sepsis, GI bleed, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, ESLD, ascites, DM, HTN, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.

   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT actually roughly at baseline, currently 29.9, previous
   hospitalizations has ranged in high 20s. However, may not reflect acute
   bleed.

   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Patient reports that he is
   having flatus.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, and tachypnea indicate sepsis. The most likely source is the peritoneal catheter, and the patient is being treated with empiric antibiotics.
2. GI Bleed: The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis and melena, which suggests a variceal bleed. The patient's history of ESLD and orthostasis also support this diagnosis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and the EKG shows no evidence of cardiac instability. However, the patient is receiving calcium and kayexalate to stabilize the membrane and decrease potassium levels.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, which may be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion or bowel ischemia. The patient is being considered for a CT scan with PO/IV contrast to rule out bowel ischemia.
5. Oliguria: The patient's bladder pressure is elevated, which may be due to postrenal or prerenal causes. The patient is being considered for therapeutic paracentesis and aggressive hydration to relieve pressure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be due to acute worsening of ESLD or malnutrition. The patient is receiving FFP and vitamin K to reverse the coagulopathy.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant and has a MELD score of 46.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is being managed with paracentesis.
9. DM: The patient is currently NPO and is being considered for insulin therapy.
10. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive and is having their home medications held.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin levels are low, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low and are being repleted as needed.

The patient is being managed in the ICU with close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and medical therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in
   ascitic fluid given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs,

   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history, including ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and elevated lactate indicating tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are:

1. Sepsis: The patient is septic, with a high white blood cell count, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. He has not received SBP prophylaxis and has a peritoneal catheter in place, making it likely that the source of sepsis is SBP.
2. GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing a slow bleed, possibly variceal, with coffee ground emesis and melena. He has a trended-down HCT, likely due to dilutional anemia.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated potassium levels, but his EKG shows no evidence of cardiac instability. He is receiving calcium for membrane stabilization and kayexalate to decrease potassium levels.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a significantly elevated lactate, which has not improved with aggressive fluids. This may be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion or bowel ischemia.
5. Oliguria: The patient has decreased urine output, despite aggressive hydration, and has a prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, likely due to acute worsening of his chronic ESLD and malnutrition.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant and has a MELD score of 46.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is being managed with paracentesis and albumin administration.
9. DM: The patient is currently NPO and has not received insulin therapy.
10. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive and is holding his home medications.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has low albumin levels, likely secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, which is being repleted as needed.

The patient is currently receiving empiric antibiotic treatment, octreotide, and proton pump inhibitors. He is also receiving aggressive hydration, albumin administration, and blood product transfusions. Further management will involve monitoring his lactate levels, urine output, and blood counts, as well as considering a CT scan with PO/IV contrast and a surgery consult."

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in
   ascitic fluid given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs,
   93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**] RBCs. Consistent with SBP.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Will give kayexalate as well to
   decrease K+
   -Kayexelate
   -EKG in AM
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   -If not improving with aggressive hydration, consider hepatorenal
   syndrome, will need albumin
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   .
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   .
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and no SBP prophylaxis.

The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the following medical issues:

1. Sepsis: The patient is septic with elevated WBC count, tachycardia, and tachypnea, indicating tissue hypoperfusion. The likely source of sepsis is SBP given the patient's history of peritoneal catheter placement and lack of SBP prophylaxis.
2. GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing GI bleeding for several days, and it is suspected to be a variceal bleed due to his history of ESLD.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated potassium levels, but his EKG shows no evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a significantly elevated lactate level, which has not improved with aggressive fluids, suggesting possible bowel ischemia.
5. Oliguria: The patient has decreased urine output, and his creatinine level has increased, indicating possible prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which is likely due to his chronic ESLD and malnutrition.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant due to his MELD score of 46.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is being managed with paracentesis and albumin replacement.
9. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, which is being repleted as needed.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

* Empiric antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) for sepsis
* Octreotide for variceal bleed
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Kayexalate for hyperkalemia
* Albumin replacement for hypoalbuminemia
* FFP for coagulopathy
* Nutrition support
* Pain management
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently ICU care. The patient's family has been informed, and the sister is planning to visit the patient this morning."

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Will give kayexalate as well to
   decrease K+
   -Kayexelate
   -EKG in AM
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Consider surgery consult
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or
   hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with prerenal
   eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion. Patient has
   received 4L NS, 4 units FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   .
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   .
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Repleting  as needed
   .
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.

   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Consider surgery consult
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or
   hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with prerenal
   eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion. Patient has
   received 4L NS, 4 units FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at high risk for sepsis due to his elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. He is already on empiric antibiotic treatment and has a high likelihood of developing sepsis given his recent hospitalization and exposures.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a strong suspicion of variceal bleed, which can lead to further bleeding and potential complications.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and metabolic acidosis may not improve with aggressive fluids and could be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, bowel ischemia, or other underlying conditions.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has not significantly increased despite aggressive hydration, and he may have a prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and decreased fibrinogen levels may indicate an acute worsening of his chronic ESLD, and he may require further reversal with FFP and vitamin K.
6. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant and has a high MELD score, which indicates a high risk of mortality without transplant.
7. Ascites: The patient is currently hypotensive and may require further management of his ascites.
8. DM: The patient is currently NPO and may require insulin therapy.
9. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive and may require further management of his blood pressure.
10. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin levels are low, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction, and he may require further management.
11. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, and he may require repletion as needed.
12. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT and may require prophylaxis with pneumatic boots.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Will give kayexalate as well to
   decrease K+
   -Kayexelate
   -EKG in AM
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Consider surgery consult
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or
   hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with prerenal
   eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion. Patient has
   received 4L NS, 4 units FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, who presented with coffee ground emesis/melena, septicemia, and no SBP prophylaxis. He has been treated with empiric antibiotics, and diagnostic paracentesis was performed. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction, including:

* Sepsis with tissue hypoperfusion
* GI bleed, suspected to be variceal
* Hyperkalemia, managed with calcium and kayexalate
* Metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion or bowel ischemia
* Oliguria, possibly due to prerenal causes, hypovolemia, or hepatorenal syndrome
* Coagulopathy, likely secondary to acute worsening of ESLD and malnutrition
* ESLD, being evaluated for transplant
* Ascites, managed with holding diuretics
* Hypoalbuminemia, likely secondary to synthetic dysfunction
* Hypocalcemia, managed with repletion

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis**: Continued tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction, potentially leading to multi-organ failure.
2. **GI bleed**: Continued bleeding, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and coagulopathy.
3. **Metabolic acidosis**: Further worsening of acidosis, potentially leading to cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and neurologic impairment.
4. **Oliguria**: Continued oliguria, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
5. **Coagulopathy**: Continued coagulopathy, potentially leading to bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematuria.
6. **ESLD**: Worsening of ESLD, potentially leading to liver failure, encephalopathy, and death.
7. **Infection**: Development of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
8. **Organ failure**: Continued organ dysfunction, potentially leading to multi-organ failure and death.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to manage sepsis and tissue hypoperfusion.
2. Monitor and manage GI bleeding, metabolic acidosis, and oliguria closely.
3. Optimize coagulation parameters and bleeding control.
4. Continue to evaluate and manage ESLD, considering liver transplantation.
5. Monitor for and prevent secondary infections.
6. Consider surgical consultation for potential bowel ischemia or other complications.
7. Optimize nutrition and glycemic control to prevent further metabolic complications."

   Imaging: [**2191-9-21**] CT abd/pelv
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffuse mild bowel wall thickening is likely secondary to third
   spacing
   in the setting of large volume ascites and anasarca. However, more
   irregular
   wall thickening in the transverse colon is noted and ischemia is not
   excluded,
   though evaluation is limited without contrast.
   2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including
   splenomegaly.
   Distal esophageal wall thickening likely represents varices, though
   evaluation
   is limited without contrast.
   3. Bibasilar lung consolidations are only partially imaged and while
   they may
   represent atelectasis, they are incompletely evaluated, as are small
   pleural
   effusion.
   4. Gastric distention, with contrast passing through into nonobstructed
   loops
   of small bowel.
   5. Nonobstructing small bilateral renal calculi.
   [**2191-9-21**] CXR
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-20**], there is continued low
   lung
   volumes. Increasing opacification at both bases consistent with
   layering
   effusion and bilateral atelectatic changes.
   The study is not upright and the possibility of free air cannot be
   assessed.
   If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be necessary.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: [**2191-9-21**] CT abd/pelv
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffuse mild bowel wall thickening is likely secondary to third
   spacing
   in the setting of large volume ascites and anasarca. However, more
   irregular
   wall thickening in the transverse colon is noted and ischemia is not
   excluded,
   though evaluation is limited without contrast.
   2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including
   splenomegaly.
   Distal esophageal wall thickening likely represents varices, though
   evaluation
   is limited without contrast.
   3. Bibasilar lung consolidations are only partially imaged and while
   they may
   represent atelectasis, they are incompletely evaluated, as are small
   pleural
   effusion.
   4. Gastric distention, with contrast passing through into nonobstructed
   loops
   of small bowel.
   5. Nonobstructing small bilateral renal calculi.
   [**2191-9-21**] CXR
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-20**], there is continued low
   lung
   volumes. Increasing opacification at both bases consistent with
   layering
   effusion and bilateral atelectatic changes.
   The study is not upright and the possibility of free air cannot be
   assessed.
   If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be necessary.
   [**2191-9-21**] RUQ u/s with dopplers
   CONCLUSION: Nodular cirrhotic liver with patent portal and hepatic
   venous
   systems. Large-volume ascites. No focal liver lesions.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, who presented with coffee ground emesis/melena and septicemia. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and lactate, indicating liver failure and sepsis. He also has hypovolemic shock, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and oliguria.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septicemia is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. He needs to be treated with antibiotics, and his blood cultures should be monitored to ensure that the infection is being effectively treated.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is severe, and he requires urgent liver transplantation. He should be referred to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypovolemic shock is a critical condition that requires immediate fluid resuscitation. He should be given IV fluids, and his blood pressure should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. He should be given calcium gluconate to stabilize his heart rhythm, and his potassium levels should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. He should be given bicarbonate to correct his acidosis, and his electrolyte levels should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
6. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. He should be given IV fluids, and his urine output should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. He should be given fresh frozen plasma to correct his coagulopathy, and his bleeding should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. The patient should be referred to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment.
2. He should be treated with antibiotics for his septicemia, and his blood cultures should be monitored to ensure that the infection is being effectively treated.
3. He should be given IV fluids to treat his hypovolemic shock, and his blood pressure should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
4. He should be given calcium gluconate to stabilize his heart rhythm, and his potassium levels should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
5. He should be given bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis, and his electrolyte levels should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
6. He should be given fresh frozen plasma to correct his coagulopathy, and his bleeding should be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
7. He should be monitored closely for signs of further complications, such as sepsis, liver failure, and bleeding."

   Imaging: [**2191-9-21**] CT abd/pelv
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffuse mild bowel wall thickening is likely secondary to third
   spacing
   in the setting of large volume ascites and anasarca. However, more
   irregular
   wall thickening in the transverse colon is noted and ischemia is not
   excluded,
   though evaluation is limited without contrast.
   2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including
   splenomegaly.
   Distal esophageal wall thickening likely represents varices, though
   evaluation
   is limited without contrast.
   3. Bibasilar lung consolidations are only partially imaged and while
   they may
   represent atelectasis, they are incompletely evaluated, as are small
   pleural
   effusion.
   4. Gastric distention, with contrast passing through into nonobstructed
   loops
   of small bowel.
   5. Nonobstructing small bilateral renal calculi.
   [**2191-9-21**] CXR
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-20**], there is continued low
   lung
   volumes. Increasing opacification at both bases consistent with
   layering
   effusion and bilateral atelectatic changes.
   The study is not upright and the possibility of free air cannot be
   assessed.
   If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be necessary.
   [**2191-9-21**] RUQ u/s with dopplers
   CONCLUSION: Nodular cirrhotic liver with patent portal and hepatic
   venous
   systems. Large-volume ascites. No focal liver lesions.
   CXR this am pending
   Microbiology: [**2191-9-20**] [**12-20**] GPC's in clusters, presumptive ID is Staph
   aureus
   [**2191-9-20**] Para with 4+ PMN's however no organisms
   [**2191-9-21**] 2 BCx's negative
   [**2191-9-21**] UCx negative
   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic, with systolics in the 80's to 110's,
   elevated WBC count although trended down today from 35 to 21, elevated
   lactate although also trending down, and acidotic with AG 15 although
   this is also trending down. Although Gstain negative likely source is
   SBP given 11k WBC's from para. Pt continues to be afebrile.
   --Continue Vanc and Zosyn today is day [**12-23**]
   --F/u Vanc level and adjust accordingly
   --No evidence of infectious source elsewhere (CXR with atelectasis, no
   clear PNA), UCx negative to date, negative imaging for other sources
   --Yesterday has not been aggresively fluid resuscitated --> got 1U
   PRBC's for volume and Hct
   --Cdiff ordered but not collected
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --If continued hypoTN would first go with blood products as necessary,
   then NS, but is anuric and may volume overload him
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices. INR is elevated and has been creeping
   back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U PRBC's yesterday with
   appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 23. Liver plans for
   EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized
   --Touch base with liver about plans for procedure
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 1U crossmatched currently, if transfused another would need 2U
   more crossed
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q4hrs today
   #Hyperkalemia: Significantly elevated K+ on admission that has been
   trended down with Kayexalate. Calcium gluconate sliding scale for
   cardiac stabilization. Renal did not feel pt had acute need for
   dialysis. Latest K normal at 4.5
   --Can stop K q4hrs, will trend [**Hospital1 **] today
   --F/u with renal re: when to start dialysis, if necessary
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 16 this am, trending down from 20's,
   without fluid resuscitation, only significant intervention being
   antibiotics. Lactate also significantly down 2.9 from high 6's on
   admission. CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical
   picture is improving.
   --Continue to trend ABG's and chemistry panel to ensure closure of gap.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. UOP still remains poor through yesterday.
   Pre-renal due to hypovolemia (however, pt received 7.5L NS and was not
   responsive) vs hepatorenal syndrome.
   --Consult renal, may need dialysis today as pt continues to be
   acidotic.
   --Would try fluid resuscitation with blood products as needed for
   volume replacement first, then boluses of NS prn
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome, have ordered but pt
   may not be able to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need tube placement if continued poor
   PO intake.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Has received 4U FFP but none
   yesterday. Normal fibrino rules out DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant. Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute
   worsening (Doppler, ect)
   --F/u with liver re: overall goals of care from liver standpoint.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hypocalcemia: Giving calcium for hyperkalemia
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving.
   --As above, consider giving some NS through today
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, no anticoagulation
   -Bowel regimen: Lactulose
   -Pain management
   ACCESS: PIV's, Right femoral line; right femoral line will need to be
   pulled today, will c/s renal first to see if they would like access for
   CVVH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - CXR post line placement: right IJ catheter terminates in SVC. no
   pneumothorax. bilateral effusions, right greater than left, underlying
   atelectasis similar to 12 hours prior.
   - CT abd/pelvis without WET: Sequela of cirrhosis and portal
   hypertension with anasarca, large volume ascites, and bilateral small
   pleural effusions. Diffuse mild bowel wall thickening may represent
   third spacing, however more irrgular wall thickening is suggested in
   the colon- ischemia is not excluded, though evaluation without contrast
   is somewhat limited. Gastric distension with oral contrast passing into
   loops of nonobstructed small bowel. No pneumoperitoneum or focal fluid
   collection.

   Imaging: [**2191-9-21**] CT abd/pelv
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffuse mild bowel wall thickening is likely secondary to third
   spacing
   in the setting of large volume ascites and anasarca. However, more
   irregular
   wall thickening in the transverse colon is noted and ischemia is not
   excluded,
   though evaluation is limited without contrast.
   2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension including
   splenomegaly.
   Distal esophageal wall thickening likely represents varices, though
   evaluation
   is limited without contrast.
   3. Bibasilar lung consolidations are only partially imaged and while
   they may
   represent atelectasis, they are incompletely evaluated, as are small
   pleural
   effusion.
   4. Gastric distention, with contrast passing through into nonobstructed
   loops
   of small bowel.
   5. Nonobstructing small bilateral renal calculi.
   [**2191-9-21**] CXR
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-20**], there is continued low
   lung
   volumes. Increasing opacification at both bases consistent with
   layering
   effusion and bilateral atelectatic changes.
   The study is not upright and the possibility of free air cannot be
   assessed.
   If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be necessary.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, who presented with coffee ground emesis/melena and septic shock in the setting of no SBP prophylaxis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for sepsis, GI bleed, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, and ESLD.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. He has a high risk of developing further complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is trending down, but his lactate level is still elevated, and he remains tachycardic.
2. GI bleed: The patient's INR is elevated, and he has a history of varices, which may be contributing to his bleeding.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is still elevated, and he is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's gap is still elevated, and he may require further interventions to correct this.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output remains poor, and he may require dialysis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is trending back upwards, and he may require further interventions to correct this.
7. ESLD: The patient is being worked up for liver transplant, but his MELD score is currently 46, which is high.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Development of septic shock: The patient's WBC count is trending down, but his lactate level is still elevated, and he remains tachycardic.
2. GI bleed: The patient's INR is elevated, and he has a history of varices, which may be contributing to his bleeding.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's hyperkalemia is a concern, and he may require further interventions to correct this.
4. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria is a concern, and he may require dialysis.
5. Liver failure: The patient's ESLD is a concern, and he may require further interventions to correct this.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and to improve his overall condition."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - CK: 77
   - Patient increasingly somnolent through the day, still maintaining
   sats. Arousable to verbal stimuli but falls asleep again before
   answering questions.
   - TTE showed a small echobright nodule attached to the posterior mitral
   leaftlet. Ddx calcification vs vegetation. TEE recommended to further
   evaluate. Given his altered mental status, he may require intubation
   for a TEE, in which case we may get a bronchoscopy as well.  Will talk
   to the sister early in the morning to discuss intubation.
   - PM labs: worsening creatinine, stable hypernatremia, declining WBC,
   stable Hct.
   - NG tube placed.  Started on rifaximin per liver recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - CK: 77
   - Patient increasingly somnolent through the day, still maintaining
   sats. Arousable to verbal stimuli but falls asleep again before
   answering questions.
   - TTE showed a small echobright nodule attached to the posterior mitral
   leaftlet. Ddx calcification vs vegetation. TEE recommended to further
   evaluate. Given his altered mental status, he may require intubation
   for a TEE, in which case we may get a bronchoscopy as well.  Will talk
   to the sister early in the morning to discuss intubation.
   - PM labs: worsening creatinine, stable hypernatremia, declining WBC,
   stable Hct.
   - NG tube placed.  Started on rifaximin per liver recs.
   - Given one dose of vanc today, check vanc level in am and schedule

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.
   Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3.
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level tomorrow morning.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. Tbili and LFT
s are also acutely increased
   --NGT and will need Lactulose today
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --Touch base with liver about plans for procedure
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 1U crossmatched currently, if transfused another would need 2U
   more crossed
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q4hrs today
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets this pm and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 16 this am, trending down from 20's,
   without fluid resuscitation, only significant intervention being
   antibiotics. Lactate also significantly down 2.9 from high 6's on
   admission. CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical
   picture is improving.
   --Continue to trend ABG's and chemistry panel to ensure closure of gap.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. UOP still remains poor through yesterday.
   Pre-renal due to hypovolemia (however, pt received 7.5L NS and was not
   responsive) vs hepatorenal syndrome.
   --Consult renal, may need dialysis today as pt continues to be
   acidotic.
   --Would try fluid resuscitation with blood products as needed for
   volume replacement first, then boluses of NS prn
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome, have ordered but pt
   may not be able to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need tube placement if continued poor
   PO intake.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant. Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute
   worsening (Doppler, ect)
   --F/u with liver re: overall goals of care from liver standpoint.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hypocalcemia: Giving calcium for hyperkalemia
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving.
   --As above, consider giving some NS through today

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and Staph aureus coag + is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid, indicating a high risk of sepsis. The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status also support this diagnosis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he is experiencing altered mental status, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of coffee ground emesis and melena, indicating a high risk of GI bleed. The INR is elevated, and the patient has received 1U PRBC's, which may indicate ongoing bleeding.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap of 16, which is trending down from the 20's, indicating a high risk of metabolic acidosis.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is poor, and the bladder pressure is high, suggesting pre-renal azotemia.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is trending back upwards, indicating a high risk of coagulopathy.
7. ESLS (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient's MELD score is 46, indicating a high risk of ESLS.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is worsening, indicating a high risk of complications such as infection and bleeding.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, which may be exacerbated by his current condition.
10. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be contributing to his current condition.
11. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, which may be contributing to his muscle weakness and other symptoms.
12. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be contributing to his current symptoms.
13. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosphatemia, which may be contributing to his current symptoms.

Based on these potential medical complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Antibiotics for sepsis and GI bleed.
2. Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Rifaximin for GI bleed and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Octreotide for GI bleed and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Protonix for GI bleed and hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Vitamin K for coagulopathy.
7. FFP for coagulopathy.
8. Midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome.
9. Albumin for hypoalbuminemia.
10. Calcium for hypocalcemia.
11. Insulin for diabetes mellitus.
12. Antihypertensives for hypertension.
13. Hyponatremia treatment, such as hypertonic saline, if necessary.
14. Hyperphosphatemia treatment, such as sevelamer, if necessary.
15. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to adjust treatment as necessary."

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.  CXR yesterday
   shows very large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. CXR
   today seems slightly improved. Patient continues to have appropriate O2
   sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated. Would cover with
   vanco, given that we now know it is staph can d/c zosyn and start cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.  Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Consult ID for + blood cultures
   --TEE Monday most likely or earlier if intubated
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3, course per ID recs depending also
   if seeded valves .
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level afternoon.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. LFTs currently trending down again after being
   acutely elevated yesterday; may have been elevated yesterday secondary
   to irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose, lactulose just increased
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving.
   --Would recheck lactate.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --1 g albumin per liver & renal recs
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   - CK: 77
   - Patient increasingly somnolent through the day, still maintaining
   sats. Arousable to verbal stimuli but falls asleep again before
   answering questions.
   - TTE showed a small echobright nodule attached to the posterior mitral
   leaftlet. Ddx calcification vs vegetation. TEE recommended to further
   evaluate. Given his altered mental status, he may require intubation
   for a TEE, in which case we may get a bronchoscopy as well.  Will talk
   to the sister early in the morning to discuss intubation.
   - PM labs: worsening creatinine, stable hypernatremia, declining WBC,
   stable Hct.
   - NG tube placed.  Started on rifaximin per liver recs.
   - Given one dose of vanc today, check vanc level in am and schedule

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are identified:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a growing Staph aureus coag-positive culture from blood and peritoneal fluid, indicating a severe infection. The patient's tachycardia, elevated WBC count, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is worsening, with lethargy and confusion. Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest ongoing liver dysfunction.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of melena and coffee-ground emesis, suggesting a GI bleed. The INR is elevated, and the patient has received blood products, indicating ongoing bleeding risk.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap of 22 mmol/L, indicating metabolic acidosis. This may be related to the patient's liver dysfunction, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is improving, but the cause is unclear. The patient may have pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular necrosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and the patient has received vitamin K, indicating ongoing bleeding risk.
7. ESRLD: The patient has ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, which may impact their liver function and overall prognosis.
8. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which may be related to liver dysfunction or other underlying conditions.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, which may be exacerbated by their current condition.
10. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be related to their underlying conditions.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be related to synthetic dysfunction or other underlying conditions.
12. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to hypovolemic hyponatremia or other underlying conditions.
13. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to their underlying conditions or medication use.
14. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosphatemia, which may be related to their underlying conditions or medication use.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration."

   - TTE showed a small echobright nodule attached to the posterior mitral
   leaftlet. Ddx calcification vs vegetation. TEE recommended to further
   evaluate. Given his altered mental status, he may require intubation
   for a TEE, in which case we may get a bronchoscopy as well.  Will talk
   to the sister early in the morning to discuss intubation.
   - PM labs: worsening creatinine, stable hypernatremia, declining WBC,
   stable Hct.
   - NG tube placed.  Started on rifaximin per liver recs.

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.  CXR yesterday
   shows very large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. CXR
   today seems slightly improved. Patient continues to have appropriate O2
   sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated. Would cover with
   vanco, given that we now know it is staph can d/c zosyn and start cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.  Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Consult ID for + blood cultures
   --TEE Monday most likely or earlier if intubated
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3, course per ID recs depending also
   if seeded valves .
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level afternoon.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. LFTs currently trending down again after being
   acutely elevated yesterday; may have been elevated yesterday secondary
   to irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose, lactulose just increased
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving.
   --Would recheck lactate.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --1 g albumin per liver & renal recs
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no SBP prophylaxis. He has a large left pleural effusion with atelectasis and is currently intubated. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 111/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show worsening creatinine, stable hypernatremia, declining WBC, and stable Hct.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum, and he will require a TEE to determine if there is seeding of the valve to determine the length of antibiotics.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is likely due to liver dysfunction and may require lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is likely due to varices or gastropathy, and he may require an EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving.
5. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is likely due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or ATN, and he may require renal support.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to liver dysfunction, and he may require FFP and vitamin K therapy.
7. ESBL: The patient's ESBL is likely due to recent drinking and may require liver transplant evaluation.
8. Ascites: The patient's ascites is likely due to liver dysfunction and may require paracentesis and albumin therapy.
9. DM: The patient's DM is likely due to insulin resistance and may require insulin therapy.
10. HTN: The patient's HTN is likely due to volume depletion and may require vasopressors and diuretics.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to liver dysfunction and may require platelet transfusion.
12. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's hyperphosphatemia is likely due to liver dysfunction and may require sevelamer therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleed, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, ESBL, ascites, DM, HTN, thrombocytopenia, and hyperphosphatemia will require close monitoring and management. The patient will require TEE to determine if there is seeding of the valve, and he may require renal support, FFP and vitamin K therapy, and insulin therapy. He will also require close monitoring of his liver function and electrolyte levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.  CXR yesterday
   shows very large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
   Concern is if possible pneumonia could be beneath. Patient continues to
   have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated.
   Would be covering as is with vanco and zosyn.
   Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3.
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level tomorrow morning.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. LFTs currently trending down again after being
   acutely elevated yesterday; may have been elevated yesterday secondary
   to irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose, lactulose just increased
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q6hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving.
   --Would recheck lactate.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to
   hypovolemia (however, pt received 7.5L NS and was not responsive) vs
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Recommended albumin for treatment of hepatorenal.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant past medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with coffee ground emesis and melena, and was found to have sepsis without organ dysfunction. He has been diagnosed with multiple comorbidities, including hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleed, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's condition has been worsening, with increasing somnolence, worsening creatinine, and declining WBC count. He has been treated with vancomycin, rifaximin, and octreotide, and has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells. He has also been placed on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, given the presence of a large pleural effusion and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is likely to continue, given the presence of a large pleural effusion and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of gastrointestinal bleed.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of hyperkalemia.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of metabolic acidosis.
6. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of oliguria.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of coagulopathy.
8. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is likely to continue, given the presence of liver failure and the fact that he has not yet been cleared of hypoalbuminemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely, and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
2. Consider consulting a liver specialist to further evaluate the patient's liver function and to determine the best course of treatment.
3. Consider performing a liver biopsy to determine the extent of liver damage and to guide further treatment.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, as necessary.
5. Consider performing a percutaneous liver biopsy to determine the extent of liver damage and to guide further treatment.
6. Consider performing a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract and to determine the cause of his gastrointestinal bleed.
7. Consider performing a CT scan to evaluate the patient's liver and to determine the extent of liver damage.
8. Consider performing a MRI scan to evaluate the patient's liver and to determine the extent of liver damage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag + growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. Most
   likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding peritoneum. Evidence of
   vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with 4wk course per ID.
   Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient continues to have

   Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for prophylaxis.
   --f/u ID recs
   --TEE Monday
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp

   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated yesterday;
   may have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large
   pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.

   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

s note, including assessment and plan. I would add:
    49 yo m with EtOH/hep C cirrhosis admitted with GI bleed,
   sepsis/suspected SBP.
   Overnight events:
   abx changed to nafcillin /cipro for better coverage of presumed
   endocarditis/SBP
   PE
   Still somnolent but able to answer simple questions
   HR 100
s, SBP 100
   Lungs: mostly CTA, slightly decrease at bases
   CV: RRR
   Abd: soft, nt+bs
   Labs: WBC down to 12 , plts down to 23 (135 a few days ago), Cr 5
   (unchanged)
   Rx: SSI, lactulose, cipro, rifaximin, mitodrine, albumin,
   (1)sepsis : Sources include SBP and MSSA bacteremia/periotonitis
   secondary to PD catheter. Echo equivocoal for endocarditis though this
   likely would represent bacteremia with secondary seeding of the valve.
   He  appears to be responding to abx as his WBC is decreasing, though he
   remains tachycardic.For now plan empiric [**2-21**] wk abx therapy given
   question of endocarditis. Surveillance cultures so far negative.
   2() Hep. encephalopathy: slow improvt on lactulose
   (3) GI bleed- no recent active bleeding, hct slowly drifting down. Plan
   for 'scope likely next wk
   (4) thrombocytopenia: causes include sepsis, worsening renal failure,
   medications. If counts drop significantly lower, will support with
   transfusion. Otherwise will trend CBC to see if this improves now that
   zosyn has been stopped
   (5) ARF: Low FENA c/w pre-renal vs (more likely) HRS. On
   Mitodrine/octeotride; Cr unchanged, but urine output acceptable at
   30-60 cc/h
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

s note, including assessment and plan. I would add:
    49 yo m with EtOH/hep C cirrhosis admitted with GI bleed,
   sepsis/suspected SBP.
   Overnight events:
   abx changed to nafcillin /cipro for better coverage of presumed
   endocarditis/SBP
   PE
   Still somnolent but able to answer simple questions
   HR 100
s, SBP 100
   Lungs: mostly CTA, slightly decrease at bases
   CV: RRR
   Abd: soft, nt+bs
   Labs: WBC down to 12 , plts down to 23 (135 a few days ago), Cr 5
   (unchanged)
   Rx: SSI, lactulose, cipro, rifaximin, mitodrine, albumin,
   (1)sepsis : Sources include SBP and MSSA bacteremia/periotonitis
   secondary to PD catheter. Echo equivocoal for endocarditis though this
   likely would represent bacteremia with secondary seeding of the valve.
   He  appears to be responding to abx as his WBC is decreasing, though he
   remains tachycardic.For now plan empiric [**2-21**] wk abx therapy given
   question of endocarditis. Surveillance cultures so far negative.
   2() Hep. encephalopathy: slow improvt on lactulose
   (3) GI bleed- no recent active bleeding, hct slowly drifting down. Plan
   for 'scope likely next wk
   (4) thrombocytopenia: causes include sepsis, worsening renal failure,
   medications. If counts drop significantly lower, will support with
   transfusion. Otherwise will trend CBC to see if this improves now that
   zosyn has been stopped
   (5) ARF: Low FENA c/w pre-renal vs (more likely) HRS. On
   Mitodrine/octeotride; Cr unchanged, but urine output acceptable at
   30-60 cc/h
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic, and the WBC count is elevated but trending down. The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of bacteremia and peritonitis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has a high risk of developing endocarditis due to the presence of MSSA bacteremia and the fact that the patient has a history of EtOH abuse and hepatitis C.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's LFTs are trending down, but the patient still has a high risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of ascites.
4. GI Bleed: The patient has a high risk of developing further GI bleeding due to the presence of varices and gastropathy.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. ARF: The patient has a high risk of developing ARF due to the presence of sepsis, hypovolemia, and the patient's underlying liver disease.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high risk of developing coagulopathy due to the presence of liver disease and the patient's underlying bleeding disorder.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high risk of developing metabolic acidosis due to the presence of lactic acidosis and the patient's underlying liver disease.
9. Oliguria: The patient has a high risk of developing oliguria due to the presence of hypovolemia and the patient's underlying liver disease.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient has a high risk of developing hypocalcemia due to the presence of liver disease and the patient's underlying bleeding disorder.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent these complications from arising. The patient requires aggressive management of their sepsis, endocarditis, and liver disease, as well as close monitoring of their platelet count, liver function, and renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and no SBP prophylaxis. He is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, and his WBC count is elevated but trending down. The patient has a high risk of developing further complications, including:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and he appears less confused today. However, his T. Bili is trending up, and he is receiving lactulose and rifaxamine to manage his condition.
2. GI Bleed: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to his low Hct and INR elevation. He is receiving octreotide and protonix IV, and his Hct will be monitored closely.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's gap is 22, and his lactate is improving. However, his condition is still being closely monitored, and surgery has been consulted.
4. Oliguria: The patient's UOP is improving, and he is receiving albumin to help with his hypovolemia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is trending upwards, and he is at risk of further bleeding. He is receiving vitamin K and FFP as needed.
6. ESLD: The patient is not a transplant candidate at this time due to his recent drinking.
7. Ascites: The patient is currently hypotensive, and his ascites is being managed with diuretics.
8. DM: The patient is currently NPO, and his insulin levels are being monitored.
9. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive, and his home medications are being held.
10. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin levels are low, and he is receiving albumin with paracentesis.
11. Hyponatremic: The patient's sodium levels are low, and he is being managed with fluid replacement.
12. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is being monitored closely.

The patient's current medications include:

* Nafcillin for endocarditis
* Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
* Rifaxamine for hepatic encephalopathy
* Octreotide for GI bleed
* Protonix IV for GI bleed
* Vitamin K for coagulopathy
* Albumin for hypovolemia
* Sevelamir for hyperphosphatemia
* Insulin for DM
* Midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* TEE to confirm endocarditis
* Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
* F/u cultures for sensitivities
* Re-Cx if spikes temp
* Get sputum Cx
* NGT given lactulose
* Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations
* EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized
* Vitamin K x3d
* Follow platelets and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active signs of bleeding
* If active bleeding, will need FFP
* Continue to monitor and manage the patient's condition closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag + growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. Most
   likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding peritoneum. Evidence of
   vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with 4wk course per ID.
   Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient continues to have
   appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated.
   Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for prophylaxis.
   --f/u ID recs
   --TEE Monday
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated yesterday;
   may have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large
   pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day

   setting of no SBP prophylaxis. Abdominal pain today.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient may need TEE to confirm, but that has
   significant risks.   Patient continues to have appropriate O2 sats,
   lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn
   d/c'd, cipro started for prophylaxis.

   --F/u ID recs
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.

   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal recommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day
   - 10pm tachy to 150's with atrial tachycardia, given Lopressor 5 IV x2
   and 250cc bolus, stat Hct sent which was 26.4 (roughly where he has
   been)

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and no SBP prophylaxis. He has a significant risk of bleeding and requires aggressive treatment with nafacillin, zosyn, and cipro. His abdominal pain is likely due to liver pain, and he has decreased bowel sounds. He has a high risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy and requires lactulose and rifaxamine. His GI bleed is likely from varices vs. gastropathy, and he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. He has tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, ESLD/ascites, diabetes, hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and he requires ongoing treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.
2. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is likely to continue, and he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment with proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and platelet transfusions.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with lactulose and rifaxamine.
4. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is likely due to hypovolemia, and he requires ongoing treatment with fluids and albumin.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with FFP and vitamin K.
6. ESLD/Ascites: The patient's ESLD/ascites is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with diuretics and albumin.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with insulin and glucose monitoring.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with antihypertensive medications.
9. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is likely to worsen if not treated promptly with albumin and nutrition support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Monitor the patient's GI bleed closely and treat with proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and platelet transfusions as needed.
3. Treat the patient's hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaxamine.
4. Monitor the patient's oliguria closely and treat with fluids and albumin as needed.
5. Treat the patient's coagulopathy with FFP and vitamin K.
6. Monitor the patient's ESLD/ascites closely and treat with diuretics and albumin as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's diabetes closely and treat with insulin and glucose monitoring as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's hypertension closely and treat with antihypertensive medications as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's hypoalbuminemia closely and treat with albumin and nutrition support as needed.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition support with a TF novasource renal 10mL/hour.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient will receive insulin and glucose monitoring to control his diabetes.
3. Lines: The patient will have multi-lumen lines for IV fluids and medication administration.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors.
5. Comments: The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU for now."

 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis. Abdominal pain today.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient
   continues to have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles
   appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for
   prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Will need repeat paracentesis [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
   --F/u ID recs
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy most likely
   on [**Month/Day (1) 305**].
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal reccommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient receiving TF, on insulin s/s
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 3.1, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient
s personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) 40s-50s. Today 26. Would check PM platelets.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient
   continues to have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles
   appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for
   prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Will need repeat paracentesis [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
   --F/u ID recs
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy most likely
   on [**Month/Day (1) 305**].
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal reccommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently

   #DM: Patient receiving TF, on insulin s/s
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 3.1, most likely secondary to synthetic

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant past medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septicemia, and oliguria.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and is septic, with Staphylococcus aureus growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. The most likely source of infection is the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, likely from varices or gastropathy.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently trending down after being acutely elevated.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a gap of 22, which may be due to gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is decreasing, which may be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular necrosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be due to liver dysfunction, but normal fibrinogen rules out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. ESBL (Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase): The patient has a history of ESBL, which may be contributing to the septicemia.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 26, which is lower than his personal baseline.
9. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin level is 3.1, which may be due to synthetic dysfunction.
10. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is high, which may be due to kidney dysfunction.

The patient is currently receiving supportive care, including antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors, and is being monitored for signs of worsening sepsis, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding
3. Hepatic encephalopathy
4. Metabolic acidosis
5. Oliguria
6. Coagulopathy
7. ESBL-related septicemia
8. Thrombocytopenia
9. Hypoalbuminemia
10. Hyperkalemia

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day
   - 10pm tachy to 150's with atrial tachycardia, given Lopressor 5 IV x2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary of Progress:**

The patient, a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse, was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, GI bleed, and multiple organ dysfunction. He was found to have Staph aureus coag + sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and peritoneal fluid, likely from peritoneal catheter seeding. He was treated with nafacillin, zosyn, and cipro for prophylaxis. His abdominal pain was managed with morphine, and he was started on lactulose and rifaxamine for hepatic encephalopathy. His GI bleed was managed with octreotide and protonix.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis**: The patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection and lack of source control.
2. **GI Bleed**: The patient is at risk for further GI bleeding due to the presence of varices and gastropathy.
3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: The patient's liver function is still impaired, and he is at risk for further hepatic encephalopathy.
4. **Acidosis**: The patient's metabolic acidosis is ongoing, and he may require further treatment to correct this.
5. **Oliguria**: The patient's oliguria may be due to pre-renal causes, and he may require further treatment to improve his renal function.
6. **Coagulopathy**: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, and he may require further treatment with FFP and vitamin K.
7. **ESLD/Ascites**: The patient's ESLD and ascites may worsen, and he may require further treatment with diuretics and albumin.
8. **DM**: The patient's DM may worsen, and he may require further treatment with insulin.
9. **HTN**: The patient's HTN may worsen, and he may require further treatment with medications.
10. **Hypoalbuminemia**: The patient's hypoalbuminemia may worsen, and he may require further treatment with albumin.
11. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, and he may require further treatment with platelet transfusions.
12. **Hyperphosphatemia**: The patient's hyperphosphatemia may worsen, and he may require further treatment with sevelamir and phosphate-binding agents.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and source control measures.
3. Manage the patient's GI bleed with octreotide and protonix.
4. Continue to treat the patient's hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaxamine.
5. Continue to manage the patient's acidosis with bicarbonate therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with FFP and vitamin K.
8. Continue to treat the patient's ESLD and ascites with diuretics and albumin.
9. Continue to manage the patient's DM with insulin.
10. Continue to manage the patient's HTN with medications.
11. Monitor the patient's hypoalbuminemia closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
12. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
13. Monitor the patient's hyperphosphatemia closely and adjust treatment as necessary."

   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis. Abdominal pain today.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient
   continues to have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles
   appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for
   prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Will need repeat paracentesis [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy most likely
   on [**Month/Day (1) 305**].
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   --Restart on beta blocker with holding parameters
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient receiving TF, on insulin s/s
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 3.1, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient
s personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) 40s-50s. Today 26. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID, minimize phosphate in TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day
   - 10pm tachy to 150's with atrial tachycardia, given Lopressor 5 IV x2
   and 250cc bolus, stat Hct sent which was 26.4 (roughly where he has
   been)

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant past medical history of ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic in setting of no SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis) prophylaxis, and abdominal pain.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic with an elevated WBC count, and Staph aureus is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. The most likely source is the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient reports usual liver pain and has flatus, bowel sounds present but decreased, and no acute abdomen, making perforation unlikely.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears less confused, and LFTs (Liver Function Tests) are trending down again after being acutely elevated.
4. GI Bleed: The patient likely has a GI bleed from varices or gastropathy, and INR (International Normalized Ratio) is elevated.
5. Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of tachycardia yesterday, which resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap of 22, and CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia, but the overall clinical picture is improving.
7. Oliguria: The patient's UOP (Urinary Output) is improving, and the cause is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis).
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is trending back upwards, and normal fibrinogen rules out DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation).
9. ESLD/Ascites: The patient is not a transplant candidate at this time due to recent drinking, and he is hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
10. DM: The patient is receiving TF (Total Parenteral Nutrition) and on insulin s/s.
11. HTN: The patient is currently hypotensive, so holding home meds.
12. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin is 3.1, likely secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
13. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 26, and he would check PM platelets.
14. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate level is high, and Sevelamir TID is being used to minimize phosphate in TF.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ failure
2. GI bleeding complications (e.g., perforation, hemorrhage)
3. Hepatic encephalopathy progression
4. Metabolic acidosis worsening
5. Oliguria or anuria progression
6. Coagulopathy-related bleeding complications
7. ESLD/ascites progression
8. DM complications (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia)
9. HTN complications (e.g., hypotension, cardiac complications)
10. Hypoalbuminemia-related edema or bleeding complications
11. Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding complications
12. Hyperphosphatemia-related kidney damage or bone disease.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for sepsis
2. Supportive care for GI bleed
3. Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
4. Rifaxamine for GI bleed
5. Octreotide for GI bleed
6. Protonix for GI bleed
7. Hct monitoring for bleeding
8. Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia
9. FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) for coagulopathy
10. Albumin infusion for hypoalbuminemia
11. Sevelamir for hyperphosphatemia
12. TF novasource renal for hyperphosphatemia
13. Code status: Full code

The patient's current disposition is ICU care, and he will require close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. He has abdominal pain, tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated. He has a coagulopathy, oliguria, and thrombocytopenia. He is also diagnosed with sepsis, septic shock, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum, and he is being treated aggressively with antibiotics.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is likely due to the liver dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is likely due to varices or gastropathy, and he is being treated with octreotide and proton pump inhibitors.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to liver dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is likely due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular necrosis, and he is being treated with albumin and midodrine.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to liver dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to the liver dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to the kidney dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
9. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely due to the liver dysfunction and may worsen if not managed properly.
10. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia is likely due to the septic shock and may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaxamine.
4. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleed with octreotide and proton pump inhibitors.
5. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.
6. Continue to manage the patient's oliguria with albumin and midodrine.
7. Continue to manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions.
8. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with lactate and bicarbonate.
9. Continue to manage the patient's hyperkalemia with potassium-sparing diuretics and insulin.
10. Continue to manage the patient's hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate and vitamin D.
11. Continue to manage the patient's hypovolemia with fluids and vasopressors.
12. Consider consulting a nephrologist for further management of the patient's kidney dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count significantly elevated
   today to 19.7. Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat
   aggressively with 4wk course per ID.  Patient continues to have

   prior to morphine, then obtunded after morphine. Tried to use smaller
   morphine doses to prevent obtundation, but patient continued to have
   abdominal pain. LFTs currently trending down again after being acutely
   elevated on [**9-22**]; may have been elevated yesterday secondary to
   irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   -- Will decrease lactulose given that patient has already made 2L of

   --Renal following, would possibly consider dialysis depending on goals
   of care
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history of End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a poor prognosis.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a significant elevation in white blood cell count (WBC) and is infected with Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to oxacillin. The likely source of the infection is the peritoneal catheter.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient has reported abdominal pain, which is likely related to his liver disease. The pain is not acute, and the patient has not developed an acute abdomen.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently trending down. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and the bilirubin levels are increasing.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to varices or gastropathy. The patient has an elevated INR, which is a risk factor for bleeding.
5. Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of tachycardia, which was resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap of 25, which suggests metabolic acidosis. The patient's lactate levels are trending up, and CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia.
7. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is decreasing, which may be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which is a risk factor for bleeding. The patient's fibrinogen levels are normal, ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
9. ESLD/Ascites: The patient has ESLD and ascites, which is not a transplant candidate at this time due to recent drinking and current infection.
10. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, which is being managed with insulin.
11. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with home medications, but is currently holding due to hypotension.
12. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely secondary to synthetic dysfunction.
13. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is trending back up.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. GI bleed-related complications (e.g., hemorrhage, perforation)
3. Metabolic acidosis-related complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, seizures)
4. Oliguria-related complications (e.g., acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalance)
5. Coagulopathy-related complications (e.g., bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation)
6. ESLD-related complications (e.g., encephalopathy, bleeding)
7. Diabetes-related complications (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia)
8. Hypertension-related complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, stroke)
9. Hypoalbuminemia-related complications (e.g., edema, ascites)
10. Thrombocytopenia-related complications (e.g., bleeding, platelet dysfunction)

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotics and antifungal medications as necessary to ensure effective treatment of the sepsis.
3. Consider transfusing platelets and/or fresh frozen plasma to correct the patient's coagulopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust lactulose and rifaximin as necessary to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes with insulin and monitor for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to discuss the patient's oliguria and potential need for dialysis.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust as necessary to prevent complications related to metabolic acidosis.
8. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to discuss the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and potential need for endoscopy or other interventions.
9. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust as necessary to prevent complications related to hypertension.
10. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to discuss the patient's hypoalbuminemia and potential need for nutritional supplements."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's imaging studies show a right-sided effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* ESLD (end-stage liver disease)
* Acute renal failure
* Peritonitis (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus)
* Anemia
* Encephalopathy (hepatic)
* Probable endocarditis
* GI bleed (quiescent at present)

The main current issue is the patient's increased white blood cell count, which will be pursued with diagnostic paracentesis. The patient will continue to receive present antibiotics and appreciate the help of the Infectious Disease department.

The patient's prognosis is dire, and the healthcare team plans to discuss this with the family today. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently being cared for in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis due to the peritonitis and endocarditis
* Acute kidney injury due to the acute renal failure
* Hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation
* GI bleed worsening
* Endocarditis-related complications, such as valve damage or emboli
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic lung disease
* Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's hypotension and tachycardia
* Infection-related complications, such as septic shock or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with liver failure, peritonitis, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is dire.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.4°C (95.8°F)
* Heart rate: 104 bpm (92-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/55 mmHg (71-129/59-72 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (10-14 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure: 14 mmHg (12-19 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.5 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.5 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 24.8% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Platelet count: 44 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 4.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 226 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 189 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Thin
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (normal)
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds anteriorly, dull posteriorly
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 1+, left lower extremity edema 1+
* Musculoskeletal: Unable to stand
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and normal tone

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* ESLD (end-stage liver disease)
* Acute renal failure
* Peritonitis (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus)
* Anemia
* Encephalopathy (hepatic)
* Probable endocarditis
* GI bleed (quiescent at present)

The main current issue is the patient's markedly increased white blood cell count, which will be addressed with diagnostic paracentesis today as per ID (infectious disease) consultation. The patient will continue to receive present antibiotic therapy for now, and ID will be consulted for further guidance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to peritonitis
* Acute kidney injury and further deterioration of renal function
* Hepatic encephalopathy and worsening of neurological status
* Endocarditis and potential cardiac complications
* GI bleeding and potential hemorrhagic complications
* Development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary can be made:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with liver failure, peritonitis, and multiple comorbidities, including acute renal failure, anemia, encephalopathy, probable endocarditis, and a quiescent GI bleed. He is critically ill and has a dire prognosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/55 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His neurological status is also stable, with the patient able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.5 x 10^9/L, which has increased significantly from previous values. His hemoglobin level is 8.8 g/dL, and his platelet count is 44 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests show elevated levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, consistent with liver failure.

The patient's imaging studies show a right effusion, which may be related to his peritonitis.

The patient's plan of care includes continuation of present antibiotics, diagnostic paracentesis, and pursuit of comfort measures only, as per family wishes.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and presence of peritonitis make him at high risk for developing sepsis.
2. Organ failure: The patient's liver and kidney function are already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may require mechanical ventilation if his condition worsens.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's probable endocarditis and liver failure make him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's quiescent GI bleed may worsen, leading to hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and neurological dysfunction.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system makes him at risk for developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and has a dire prognosis. His care plan should focus on providing comfort measures only, while also monitoring for potential medical complications and addressing them promptly if they arise."
