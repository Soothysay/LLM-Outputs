   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent a successful thrombectomy of a proximal left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion with 20% residual stenosis. However, the patient developed an acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal (OM) branch due to an embolus, which was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a 60% residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. The patient was unstable during the procedure and was intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at high risk of developing complete heart block. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is taking anticoagulation medications.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving dopamine for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and is being weaned off the IABP.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.72 ng/mL and a creatine kinase (CK) level of 6036 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and high risk of developing complete heart block may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and current use of anticoagulation medications may lead to further bleeding or perforation.
3. Renal complications: The patient's current creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL and history of chronic renal failure may lead to further decline in renal function or acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's current use of antibiotics and anticoagulation medications may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant infections or other infectious complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further decline in renal function or acute kidney injury.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust therapy as needed to prevent infectious complications.

ICU care:

1. Continue to provide close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust therapy as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Continue to provide antibiotics and anticoagulation medications as needed to prevent infection and bleeding.
4. Continue to provide nutrition and glycemic control as needed to prevent malnutrition and hyperglycemia.
5. Continue to provide prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a history of allergies to Vioxx, Bactrim, Codeine, Aspirin, and Ranitidine. The patient has a current condition of hematemesis (upper GI bleed, UGIB), shock, and cardiac infarction (myocardial infarction, acute, AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI). The patient is currently receiving ICU care and has been intubated for invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 79 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/35 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.2
* Hematocrit: 29
* Platelet count: 165
* Creatinine: 2.0
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18
* Glucose: 365
* Potassium: 19 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to cardiac infarction
* Respiratory failure due to invasive ventilation
* Septicemia due to GI bleed and potential bacterial colonization
* Renal failure due to hypovolemia and potential nephrotoxicity
* Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis
* Hypotension due to shock
* Electrolyte imbalance due to GI bleed and potential metabolic derangements
* Infection due to invasive lines and devices

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has undergone various interventions, including invasive ventilation, IABP, and PA catheter placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal tube ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level, indicating potential cardiac and metabolic distress. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with an international normalized ratio of 1.3 and activated partial thromboplastin time of 150 seconds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage. The patient's IABP line and PA catheter placement may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation, which carries a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's endoscopy report suggests possible lower esophageal tears, which may lead to bleeding, perforation, or other complications.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and the patient may be at risk of hypotension or hypertension.
5. Coagulation disorders: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate metabolic distress, which may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
7. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate infection. The patient's invasive lines and devices may increase the risk of infection.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip

   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He developed acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal (OM) branch and was intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at high risk of developing complete heart block.

Current Condition:

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for:

* Acute anterior myocardial infarction
* Acute systolic and diastolic heart failure
* Acute respiratory failure
* Acute renal failure
* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
* Hypertension
* Chronic renal failure
* Diabetes
* Asthma
* Gout
* GERD

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen due to the acute anterior myocardial infarction and the presence of an IABP.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of an IABP and the risk of bacterial colonization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to the acute anterior myocardial infarction and the presence of an IABP.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to worsen due to the presence of an IABP and the risk of acute tubular necrosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding due to the presence of an IABP and the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias due to the presence of an IABP and the risk of complete heart block.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to the presence of an IABP and the risk of bacterial colonization.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications. The patient should be treated with:

* Aggressive fluid management to prevent hypotension
* Vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Inotropes to improve cardiac function
* Anti-coagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis
* Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent sepsis
* Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis
* Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes
* Close monitoring of cardiac function and arrhythmias
* Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation
* Close monitoring of gastrointestinal function and bleeding
* Close monitoring of infectious complications

The patient should be treated in the ICU for the time being, and a multidisciplinary team should be involved in his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, overweight/obese individual who was admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and cardiac tamponade. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and was receiving dopamine and heparin infusions. The patient's cardiac rhythm was irregular, with a heart rate of 102 bpm and a blood pressure of 104/41 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results showed evidence of coagulopathy, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient's platelet count was low, and the patient had a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and troponin-T. The patient's electrolyte levels were abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for a history of wheezing, lightheadedness, and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of allergy to aspirin and ranitidine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT, as well as the patient's low platelet count, suggest a high risk of bleeding complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and STEMI, as well as the patient's current cardiac rhythm and blood pressure, suggest a high risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy suggest a high risk of respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's high level of creatinine and urea nitrogen suggest a high risk of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of wheezing and lightheadedness, as well as the patient's current laboratory results, suggest a high risk of infection, including pneumonia and sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and the patient's current laboratory results suggest a high risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure closely.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including electrolyte levels, creatinine, and urea nitrogen.
4. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a cardiac care unit or a cardiothoracic intensive care unit for further management.
6. Consider performing an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
7. Consider performing a CT scan or MRI to evaluate the patient's abdominal and pelvic organs.
8. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to evaluate the patient's cerebrospinal fluid.
9. Consider performing a bronchoscopy to evaluate the patient's airways.
10. Consider performing a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's colon."

   Assessment and Plan
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on a balloon pump with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to hypotension. The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and is requiring hemodialysis. The patient has also developed a upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and is being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and carafate. The patient has a platelet count of 64,000/mL and is bleeding rapidly, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. The patient's lactate level is elevated at 0.9 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Complete heart block due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of verapamil.
	* Ventricular arrhythmias due to the patient's hypotension and the use of dopamine.
	* Cardiac tamponade due to the patient's cardiac arrest and the use of IABP.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's hypotension and the use of IABP.
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's hypotension and the use of IABP.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Bleeding due to the patient's platelet count of 64,000/mL and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
	* Anemia due to the patient's hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis due to the patient's hypotension and the use of IABP.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's use of mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider inserting a temporary pacemaker wire if the patient's heart rate becomes irregular.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider initiating hemodialysis if the patient's creatinine level becomes elevated.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if the patient's bleeding does not respond to medical therapy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hematological status and consider transfusing platelets if the patient's platelet count becomes critically low.
5. Consider initiating antibiotic therapy if the patient develops signs of sepsis or VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   Repeat ECG this morning showed left axis deviation and RBB
   block -> pt likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block,
   and is at high risk to develop complete heart block
   - will consult EP RE: ? indication for temp pacer wire placement ->
   appreciate recs
   - Hold VERAPAMIL 120 mg in setting of hypotension
   - serial ECGs
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.
   .
   FEN: NPO

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent a successful thrombectomy of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion with 20% residual stenosis, but developed an acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal (OM) artery, which was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a 60% residual thrombotic occlusion.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple medical complications. She has:

1. Cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated, but she remains unstable.
2. A prolonged QT interval, which may increase the risk of torsades de pointes.
3. Left anterior fascicular block and right bundle branch block, which may increase the risk of complete heart block.
4. Acute kidney injury, which may be secondary to pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, or ATN.
5. Hypotension, which may be secondary to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock.
6. Respiratory failure, which may be secondary to pneumonia, aspiration, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
7. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be secondary to erosive gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or Mallory-Weiss syndrome.
8. Diabetes, which may be uncontrolled, and may increase the risk of hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and diabetic nephropathy.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her various conditions, including:

1. Intensive care unit (ICU) care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and hemodynamic monitoring.
2. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Glycemic control with insulin, which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
5. Nutritional support with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which may increase the risk of malnutrition and infection.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis with histamine-2 (H2) blockers, which may increase the risk of pneumonia.
7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and treatment of her various conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure who presented with STEMI and was brought emergently to the cath lab. She underwent thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with successful restoration of flow, but developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus) treated with thrombectomy and PTCA.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing cardiogenic and septic shock, and mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology. She has a high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance, with a mixed acid-base disorder. Her blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, and she has a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelets.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology.
2. Ongoing septic shock with hypotension and tachycardia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
4. Low-grade DIC with declining platelets.
5. Positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters.
6. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with friable esophagus and blood clot at the gastroesophageal junction.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK) levels.
2. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.
3. Decreased platelet count.
4. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.
5. Elevated blood glucose levels.

The patient's medications include:

1. Dopamine for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg.
2. Heparin for anticoagulation.
3. Integrillin for 18 hours post-cath.
4. Atorvastatin for lipid-lowering therapy.
5. Aspirin for antiplatelet therapy.
6. Plavix for antiplatelet therapy.
7. Insulin drip for glycemic control.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning of IABP and heparin as tolerated.
2. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) as needed.
3. Monitoring of cardiac index and SvO2.
4. Serial echocardiograms to assess cardiac function.
5. Repeat TTE to assess right ventricular function.
6. Repeat EGD to assess upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitoring of creatinine and BUN levels.
8. Adjustments to medications as needed to optimize cardiovascular and renal function.

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, who presented with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the catheterization laboratory. She developed acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal (OM) artery and was intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to hemodynamic instability. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction, including cardiogenic shock, septic physiology, and acute kidney injury. She has a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelet counts and is at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is decreased, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic physiology: The patient's septic physiology is ongoing, and she is at risk for further organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to her cardiogenic shock, septic physiology, and possibly contrast-induced nephropathy.
4. DIC: The patient's low-grade DIC is a concern, and she is at risk for further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying lung disease and cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she is at risk for further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is ongoing, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying cardiogenic shock and septic physiology.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a concern, and she is at risk for further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to her underlying septic physiology and immunosuppression.
10. Organ failure: The patient is at risk for further organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with thrombectomy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is currently intubated and on pressors, with a balloon pump in place. The patient has a coagulopathy with declining platelet counts and is at risk for bleeding. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on verapamil for rate control. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and low platelet count increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with the presence of an IABP and balloon pump.
2. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the presence of an infection, which may be related to the sepsis or the IABP.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of an IABP increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels and history of chronic renal failure increase the risk of renal failure, particularly with the use of contrast agents and IABP.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of an IABP increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and the presence of an IABP increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of an IABP increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
8. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the presence of sepsis, which may be related to the IABP or the sepsis.
9. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of STEMI and the presence of an IABP increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
10. Septic shock: The patient's positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the presence of septic shock, which may be related to the IABP or the sepsis.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are needed to manage her bleeding, infection, and cardiac complications. The patient's DNR status should be respected, and the family should be informed of the patient's poor prognosis. The patient's care should be focused on managing her symptoms and improving her quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall adult admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of unknown. The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including antibiotics, insulin, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/43 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a set rate of 12 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show a platelet count of 48 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is at risk for shock, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and hematemesis due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has cardiac issues, including atrial fibrillation and a myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction put them at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and platelet count of 48 K/uL put them at risk for bleeding complications, including hematemesis, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters put them at risk for infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support and presence of a ventilator put them at risk for respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated lung injury and respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli put them at risk for neurological complications, including seizures, cerebral edema, and brain death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired skin integrity put them at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and abscesses.
7. Renal complications: The patient's oliguria and presence of catheters put them at risk for renal complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
8. Hepatic complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and presence of central lines put them at risk for hepatic complications, including liver failure and cholestasis."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - will attempt to wean IABP: will discuss with family prior to pulling
   pump, as it could precipitation bradycardia, vagal reflex, bleeding,
   etc.
   - will continue dopamine, titrate to MAP in 60s.   IVF as needed.  Per
   discussion with family, will not add another pressor if needed for BP
   support
   - will transfuse PRBCs as needed
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now, plan to pull lines when
   patient more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, replete as needed
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, pneumo boots when heparin drip
   discontinued
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She presented with a STEMI and was brought to the cath lab for emergent angioplasty and thrombectomy. The patient developed an acute occlusion of the OM artery and was intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to hemodynamic instability.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 7 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Cardiac rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 11.1 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 27.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 48 K/μL
* Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: potassium 4.8 mEq/L, sodium 133 mEq/L, chloride 111 mEq/L

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with potential medical complications including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index is high, and she is receiving dopamine to support her blood pressure.
2. Septic physiology: The patient has a low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and is at risk for septic shock.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and is at risk for bleeding.
6. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be related to her cardiac condition, sepsis, or other underlying causes.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be complicated by respiratory failure.
8. Infection: The patient has a central line, arterial line, and IABP, which increases her risk of infection.
9. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a history of thrombosis and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and hemodynamics.
2. Titration of dopamine to support her blood pressure.
3. Transfusion of packed red blood cells as needed.
4. Continued antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime.
5. Pulmonary artery catheterization to monitor her cardiac output and blood pressure.
6. Weaning of the IABP and removal of the central line and arterial line when possible.
7. Monitoring of her renal function and electrolyte levels.
8. Management of her upper gastrointestinal bleed with proton pump inhibitors and antacids.
9. Consultation with the gastroenterology and cardiology teams as needed.

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is to remain in the CCU for further management and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, currently intubated on
   pressors being weaned off a balloon pump, also with coag positive staph
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - Poor prognosis discussed with family, pt made [**Year (4 digits) 617**].
   - Will wean IABP.  Will not escalate care after pulling IABP.
   - Will titrate down dopamine.
   - Will not further transfuse PRBCs
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, on Verapamil for rate
   control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of GI bleed.   ECG
   now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt likely has left
   anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high risk to develop
   complete heart block.  Overnight, patient intermittently in A fib with
   fast then slow ventricular response.  Tends to become hypotensive when
   rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts, however
   now stable in high 40s
   - Will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, expect improvement with d/c of
   IABP
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Holding outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - Continue plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1.
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no signs of volume
   overload currently
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], sucralafate 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - follow crit, has been stable
   - 4 units cross-matched
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: continue insulin gtt
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil for now
   .
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient
   1.3 - 1.9.  Pt now with creatinine to 2.8.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position).  Renal failure is likely contributing to acidotic state.
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes. Greater than 50% time
   counseling / coordinating care.
   Additional comments:
   Due to overwhelming nature of patient's illness and near-impossibility
   of chance of reasonable recovery, along with her stated wishes
   (confirmed by family) to not have extreme end of life measures, we will
   withdraw the current intensive level of care and make the patient
   comfortable. Family meeting (including Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3342**] and Nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 9070**])
   during which family agreed with this plan.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, currently intubated on
   pressors being weaned off a balloon pump, also with coag positive staph
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - Poor prognosis discussed with family, pt made [**Year (4 digits) 617**].
   - Will wean IABP.  Will not escalate care after pulling IABP.
   - Will titrate down dopamine.
   - Will not further transfuse PRBCs
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, on Verapamil for rate
   control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of GI bleed.   ECG
   now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt likely has left
   anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high risk to develop
   complete heart block.  Overnight, patient intermittently in A fib with
   fast then slow ventricular response.  Tends to become hypotensive when
   rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts, however
   now stable in high 40s
   - Will continue to monitor Hct and Plts, expect improvement with d/c of
   IABP
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Holding outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - Continue plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1.
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no signs of volume
   overload currently
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], sucralafate 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - follow crit, has been stable
   - 4 units cross-matched
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: continue insulin gtt
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil for now
   .
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient
   1.3 - 1.9.  Pt now with creatinine to 2.8.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position).  Renal failure is likely contributing to acidotic state.
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor creatinine
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes. Greater than 50% time
   counseling / coordinating care.
   Additional comments:
   Due to overwhelming nature of patient's illness and near-impossibility
   of chance of reasonable recovery, along with her stated wishes
   (confirmed by family) to not have extreme end of life measures, we will
   withdraw the current intensive level of care and make the patient
   comfortable. Family meeting (including Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3342**] and Nurse [**Last Name (Titles) 9070**])
   during which family agreed with this plan.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, and a recent STEMI. She is currently intubated and on pressors, with a mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology, which is causing shock. The patient has a high risk of developing complete heart block due to her history of atrial fibrillation and recent coronary artery disease.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed closely. These include:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient has low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelet counts, which needs to be monitored and managed with heparin and platelet transfusions.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle, which may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on pressors, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased to 2.8, which may be due to pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, or acute tubular necrosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for recurrent bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and recent cardiac catheterization.
6. Septic physiology: The patient has septic physiology, which increases the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning off the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine.
2. Continuing heparin therapy to manage coagulopathy.
3. Monitoring and managing cardiac dysfunction with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.
4. Managing respiratory failure with ventilatory support and prophylaxis for VAP.
5. Monitoring and managing renal failure with volume repletion and renal dose medications.
6. Managing gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate.
7. Continuing insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her family has agreed to withdraw life-sustaining therapies and make her comfortable. The patient's prognosis is poor, and her family has been counseled on this."

   IABP
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Holding outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - Continue plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1.
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no signs of volume
   overload currently

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year old female with DM, HTN who presented with
   STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, currently intubated on
   pressors being weaned off a balloon pump, also with coag positive staph
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock with mixed cardiogenic and septic physiology -> CO and CI high,
   SVR low.  Pt systemically vasodilated.
   - Call family as patient not improving, discuss poor prognosis as
   patient not improving.  Discuss withdrawal of care.
   - Will pull IABP, as patient not improving on balloon pump and
   platelets low, possibly [**1-9**] balloon pump, also with possible
   bacteremia.  Will not escalate care after pulling IABP.
   - Will titrate down dopamine.
   - Will not further transfuse PRBCs
   - continue abx with vanc/cefepime for now
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient presumably on
   Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation due to prior history of
   GI bleed.   ECG now showing left axis deviation and RBB block -> pt
   likely has left anterior fascicular block and RBB block, and is at high
   risk to develop complete heart block.  Overnight, patient
   intermittently in A fib with fast then slow ventricular response.
   Tends to become hypotensive when rapid or brady.
   - EP consulted, recs appreciated.  No indication for pacemaker at
   present.
   - serial ECGs
   - will continue to monitor and hold off on starting antiarrhythmics at
   present
   .
   # Blood Cx positive: As above, will continue abx, IV fluids for now.
   Will pull lines when patient more stable.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: labs reflect low grade DIC with declining plts.
   - Will continue to monitor Hct and Plts
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient had
   successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20% residual
   stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due to an embolus)
   treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm balloon) with a 60%
   residual thrombotic occlusion but restoration of flow. Patient was
   unstable during procedure and consequently was intubated and IABP
   placed. No stent was placed during procedure.
   - Continue integrillin 18 hours post cath -> now discontinued
   - Continue heparin while on IABP
   - Patient on Atorvastatin 10 mg outpatient, increase to 80 mg in
   setting of ACS
   - Continue dopamine for goal MAP 60, attempt to wean -> unable to wean
   overnight
   - will attempt to wean IABP today, will reach goal PA diastolic
   pressure of 25 via volume, then attempt to wean to 1:2, obtain SvO2,
   PaO2, and Hb and calculate cardiac index; if data shows stability, will
   continue 1:4, 1:8 as able
   - if pt tolerates 1:8 for 2 hours, will switch off heparin, switch to
   1:1, and remove IABP
   - Hold outpatient Lisinopril 10 mg due to hypotension
   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload
   .
   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .
   .
   # Diabetes: Insulin drip
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds
   - will ensure volume repletion with goal PA diastolic pressure of 25
   mmHg
   - monitor crea
   .
   # Asthma: Patient intubated.
   .
   # Gout: Hold Allopurinal in acute setting.
   .
   # GERD: IV PPI fo now, transition to po when stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - No B-blocker due to hypotension
   - Start ASA 325 mg
   - Start plavix in am for 12 months (however no stent placed)
   .
   # PUMP: ECHO s/p cath demonstrates EF 45% with mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated right ventricle with
   moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New changes secondary to ACS.
   Repeat TTE shows little change while on IABP 1:1
   - Patient will require ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, however cont
   to hold due to hypotension
   - Held outpatient Lasix 20 mg qd due to hypotension, no sign of volume
   overload

   # Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood clot at
   GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently stable. Due to
   ballon pump patient must remain on heparin anti-coagulation.
   Integrelin stopped this AM.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate slurry 1 g QID, reglan per GI
   - appreciate GI recs -> if UGIB recurs, will contact GI for possible
   repeat endoscopy. Patient may require Sang-[**Doctor Last Name 4220**] tube
   - IR aware of pt, can contact if need for emergent embolization
   - q4hr HCT -> 26 this AM, will transfuse 2 units today
   - cross match 4 units
   - wean ballon pump today in order to stop heparin  .

   # Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient 1.3 -
   1.9.  Pt now has [**Last Name (un) **] this morning.  Possible etiologies include
   pre-renal physiology, cholesterol emboli, contrast-induced nephropathy,
   ATN, and IABP renal artery obstruction (unlikely given current
   position)
   - renal dose all meds

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac conditions, who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was brought to the catheterization lab. During the procedure, she developed acute occlusion of the obtuse marginal artery (OM) and was intubated and placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). She has a coag-positive staph bacteremia and is currently septic. The patient has a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with declining platelet counts.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/43 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 48 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27.4 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 156 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Diabetes
* Hypertension
* Chronic renal failure
* Asthma
* Gout
* GERD
* Upper gastrointestinal bleed

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for coag-positive staph bacteremia
* Integrelin for 18 hours post-cath
* Heparin for IABP
* Dopamine for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60
* Aspirin 325 mg
* Plavix in the morning for 12 months
* ACE-I and B-blocker as outpatient, but holding due to hypotension
* Lasix 20 mg qd held due to hypotension
* IV PPI and carafate slurry for upper gastrointestinal bleed
* Insulin drip for diabetes

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Cardiac failure
* Renal failure
* Respiratory failure
* Septic shock
* DIC
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Hypotension
* Hypoxia
* Infection

The patient's code status is DNR, and the family has been informed of her poor prognosis. The patient's disposition is to remain in the intensive care unit (ICU) for now."
