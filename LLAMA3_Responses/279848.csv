   Cardiac cath: [**2179-2-14**]
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
   OSH blood culture:
 bottles positive for GPC, speciation and
   sensitivities pending
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   - restart heparin gtt
   - remove swan catheter today
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - remove swan today
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.  However, her weight loss and decreased appetite could be due
   to related to heart failure and bowel congestion, especially given her
   elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   - remove swan today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's mean arterial pressure is 152/87 mmHg, and her central venous pressure is 63/43 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via a face tent, and her SpO2 is 98%.
* Cardiac rhythm: The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, which may be due to decreased coronary supply to the AV node from the right coronary artery.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an elevated potassium level of 4.6 mg/dL and a decreased sodium level of 137 mmol/L.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 19 mg/dL.
* Liver function: The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

* Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient has acute decompensated congestive heart failure, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
* Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen her heart failure and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
* Diabetic neuropathy: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus II, which may lead to diabetic neuropathy.
* Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, which may lead to further complications.

   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI (elevated troponin-T of 1.04), now down-trending.
   Given low CK, elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely
   patient had acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now
   down-trending. Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be
   in the setting of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath today.
   Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - IABP if worsening chest pain, worsening heart failure or hypotension
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - no indication for IABP currently, can consider placement of IABP if
   hypotensive or heart failure worsens
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, hydralazine, captopril
   - goal SBP 120-130s to decrease afterload: if achievable with
   metoprolol and ACEI, can consider stopping hydralazine.
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and severe pulmonary hypertension.

The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving treatment for her conditions. She has a PA catheter in place, and has received lasix 40mg IV to manage her fluid balance. She is also receiving beta-blocker, high-dose statin, and captopril to manage her cardiac condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 152/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her respiratory status is compromised, with decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, more significantly decreased breath sounds at the right base, and mild crackles at the right base.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels, which are trending down. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 306 K/uL.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. She is also a current smoker and has a history of smoking cessation attempts.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of cardiac function: The patient's cardiac condition is severe, and worsening of cardiac function could lead to further decompensation of her heart failure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is severe, and worsening of this condition could lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture is positive for GPC, and sepsis could develop if the infection is not adequately treated.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and her current condition could increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Medication non-compliance: The patient's history of non-compliance with her medications could lead to further complications if she does not adhere to her treatment plan.
7. Smoking-related complications: The patient's smoking history could lead to further complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, or other smoking-related illnesses.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and to adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 152/87 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 31 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on a face tent.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, more significantly decreased at the right base, and mild crackles at the right base. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses palpated. Her peripheral vascular examination reveals a normal radial and dorsalis pedis pulse bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 306 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 0.87 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes a history of CAD, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. She is a current smoker and has a history of smoking-related illnesses.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and COPD make her at risk for respiratory failure and worsening of her respiratory symptoms.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening of her chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and fever suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis and infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of smoking and her current condition make her at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's heart failure and pulmonary hypertension aggressively.
3. Consider the use of vasopressors to support the patient's blood pressure.
4. Consider the use of diuretics to manage the patient's fluid status.
5. Consider the use of antibiotics to treat the patient's suspected infection.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and pain management.
7. Consider the use of a Swan-Ganz catheter to monitor the patient's cardiac output and pulmonary pressures.
8. Consider the use of a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the patient's pulmonary pressures and cardiac output.
9. Continue to educate the patient and her family about her condition and the importance of smoking cessation.
10. Consider the use of a smoking cessation program to help the patient quit smoking."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient's Background:

* 72-year-old female with known CAD, DMII, HTN, HLD, and current smoker
* S/p IMI with RCA BMS placement
* Transferred from OSH with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure

Current Condition:

* Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30% on TTE)
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Right and left sided heart failure
* Decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase, consistent with COPD
* Elevated wedge pressure, which worsened pulmonary hypertension
* 30 lb weight loss over the past 6 months, unintentional

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart Failure: The patient's acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is likely to worsen due to elevated wedge pressure and COPD.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's 1st AV block on EKG and decreased coronary supply to the AV node may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Thromboembolic Event: The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture from OSH may indicate the presence of an infection, which could worsen her condition.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's decreased appetite and weight loss may lead to malnutrition if not properly managed.
8. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's history of non-compliance with medication may lead to worsening of her condition if not addressed.

Assessment and Plan:

* Continue ASA, beta-blocker, and high-dose statin
* Encourage smoking cessation
* Aggressively treat heart failure with diuretics and vasodilators
* Monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and adjust treatment accordingly
* Continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
* Remove swan catheter today
* F/u with cardiology and pulmonary medicine for further evaluation and management
* Obtain a colonoscopy to work up the patient's weight loss
* F/u with the patient regularly for outpatient follow-up."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and is a current smoker. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Current status:

* The patient's cardiac enzymes are down-trending, and she is receiving heparin, aspirin, beta-blocker, and high-dose statin.
* She has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, with diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.
* She has pulmonary hypertension, which may be chronic, and is likely contributing to her symptoms.
* She has a positive urine culture for coagulase-negative staph, which is likely contamination.
* She has a positive troponin level, indicating myocardial injury.
* She is receiving diuretics and has a goal of -1L fluid balance today.

Potential medical complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen if not managed aggressively, leading to increased risk of right ventricular failure and death.
3. UTI: The patient's positive urine culture may indicate a urinary tract infection, which may lead to sepsis and other complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. DVT/PE: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and recent hospitalization increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
6. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and history of hospitalization increase her risk of developing infections, which may lead to sepsis and other complications.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac disease and recent hospitalization increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which may lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive management of heart failure, including diuretics and vasodilators.
2. Aggressively treat pulmonary hypertension, including oxygen therapy and pulmonary vasodilators.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for UTI and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Monitor for signs of DVT/PE and consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
5. Monitor respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and consider broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy if necessary.
7. Monitor cardiac status and consider anti-arrhythmic therapy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2589**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Well on IV UFH awaiting CABG on Friday.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2180-2-16**] 10:17 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CTA ruled out PE, the patient's bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of PE.
2. Heart Failure (HF): The patient has acute decompensated congestive heart failure, and the low ejection fraction (EF 30%) increases the risk of HF exacerbation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased breath sounds, prolonged expiratory phase, and mild crackles at the right base may indicate respiratory failure, which can worsen HF.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has diabetes mellitus II, and the high glucose levels (169 mg/dL) increase the risk of DKA.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the patient's UTI is being treated with cipro, the positive blood culture for coagulase-negative staph may indicate a deeper infection.
6. Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's 1st-degree atrioventricular (AV) block may worsen, and the risk of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia is increased due to the patient's underlying cardiac conditions.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's known PVD and stable exertional calf claudication increase the risk of worsening PVD, which can lead to limb ischemia or gangrene.
8. Malignancy: The patient's interstitial abnormality in the left lung and nodularity raise concern for lymphangitic carcinomatosis, which requires further evaluation.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's low sodium diet, fluid restriction, and strict insulin and oral medications may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's lack of compliance with medications and medical advice increases the risk of adverse outcomes and disease progression.

To mitigate these complications, the patient should be closely monitored in the ICU, and the healthcare team should optimize medical management to address these potential issues."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Acute decompensated congestive heart failure with both right and left sided heart failure
* Elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)
* Pulmonary hypertension, likely chronic, leading to right ventricular diastolic dysfunction and peripheral congestion
* Decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Evidence of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and trace pulmonary edema on physical examination

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening heart failure with increased pulmonary congestion and edema
* Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation, potentially leading to right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema and congestion
* Decreased oxygenation due to COPD and pulmonary hypertension
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and platelet dysfunction
* Infection, particularly urinary tract infection (UTI) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), due to indwelling catheters and medical devices
* Kidney injury or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume overload and decreased perfusion
* Electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia, due to diuretic therapy and cardiac dysfunction
* Malnutrition and weight loss due to decreased appetite and cardiac cachexia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Aggressive treatment of heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes
* Pulmonary hypertension management with oxygen therapy and phosphodiesterase inhibitors
* Smoking cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy
* Colonoscopy to investigate weight loss and potential gastrointestinal malignancy
* Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels
* Close follow-up with cardiology and pulmonology services

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU) to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine

   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has known 3-vessel disease and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to desaturation with ambulation. She has been stable since admission but requires ongoing management of her heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to ongoing CAD and potential for future cardiac events.
	* Heart failure exacerbation due to ongoing fluid overload and decreased cardiac function.
	* Pulmonary edema due to elevated pulmonary wedge pressures and chronic pulmonary hypertension.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and chronic pulmonary hypertension.
3. Infectious complications:
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI) due to indwelling urinary catheter.
	* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) due to central venous catheter.
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged anticoagulation and potential for bleeding complications.
	* Bowel obstruction due to chronic constipation and potential for bowel ischemia.
5. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to ongoing CAD and potential for embolic events.
	* Cognitive decline due to chronic heart failure and potential for decreased cerebral perfusion.
6. Nutritional complications:
	* Malnutrition due to prolonged NPO status and potential for decreased caloric intake.
	* Dehydration due to ongoing diuresis and potential for fluid overload.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple comorbidities to prevent potential complications and optimize her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) who is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has a history of smoking, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's condition is complicated by right and left-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's current condition is stable, but she is experiencing dyspnea on exertion and has been desaturating with ambulation. She is receiving treatment for heart failure, including diuretics and beta-blockers, and is being monitored for pulmonary hypertension and COPD. The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a history of non-compliance with her medication regimen.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and pulmonary hypertension increase her risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's heart failure and pulmonary hypertension may exacerbate her renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's UTI and history of non-compliance with her medication regimen increase her risk for developing other infections, including sepsis and bacteremia.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's cardiac and diabetic diet may not be meeting her nutritional needs, leading to malnutrition and related complications.
6. Psychological complications: The patient's history of smoking and non-compliance with her medication regimen may indicate underlying psychological issues, including depression and anxiety, which could impact her recovery.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
2. Optimize her respiratory therapy, including oxygen therapy and bronchodilators, to manage her COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
3. Monitor her renal function closely and adjust her diuretic regimen as necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to treat her UTI and monitor for signs of sepsis or bacteremia.
5. Provide nutritional counseling and support to ensure she is meeting her nutritional needs.
6. Consider referring the patient to a psychologist or psychiatrist to address any underlying psychological issues that may be impacting her recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion. He has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure. He is currently receiving treatment for acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU due to concerns about ambulatory desaturation and right pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 133/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination is notable for diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, and he has a right lower extremity edema. His neurological examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. Other laboratory results, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood glucose levels, are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Right pleural effusion: The patient's clinical signs of right pleural effusion require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as respiratory distress and cardiac tamponade.
2. Ambulatory desaturation: The patient's history of ambulatory desaturation requires close monitoring to prevent further episodes and potential complications such as hypoxia and cardiac arrest.
3. Heart failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure requires continued management to prevent further decompensation and potential complications such as cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.
4. DVT prophylaxis: The patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires continued prophylaxis to prevent DVT and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
5. Glycemic control: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II requires continued management to prevent hyperglycemia and potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma."

   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to her worsening condition. The patient has a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. She has undergone cardiac catheterization and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Dyspnea on exertion
* Right pleural effusion
* Carotid ultrasound showing bilateral 40% stenosis
* Decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields
* Prolonged expiratory phase
* Mild venous stasis at ankles bilaterally
* Left lower extremity edema
* Elevated troponin levels
* Decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 30%
* Elevated pulmonary wedge pressures
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Chronic kidney disease

Potential medical complications:

* Further decompensation of CHF
* Development of cardiogenic shock
* Increased risk of respiratory failure
* Increased risk of pulmonary embolism
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of infection due to indwelling lines and devices
* Increased risk of medication non-compliance
* Increased risk of smoking-related complications
* Potential need for urgent surgery due to worsening symptoms

Assessment and plan:

* Continue beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy
* Continue heparin gtt and low-molecular-weight heparin
* Continue diuretic therapy and fluid restriction
* Continue oxygen therapy as needed
* Continue smoking cessation counseling
* Continue education on heart failure management and medication regimen
* Plan for urgent surgery if symptoms worsen or do not improve with medical therapy
* Plan for post-operative care and management of potential complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.  She was taken to the OR and
   therefore off of the CCU service on [**2180-2-18**]. She has several issues;
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - To OR today
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - patient given smoking cessation information by SW
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Serial CXR and physical exams
   show significant right effusiom  Her sx of SOB is likely secondary to
   heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates; patient may need home 02, reassess post-op
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - communicate these plans to CSURG team
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%. Patient not
   likely to benefit from intensive glucose control. However, needs better
   control than currently managing.
   - continue RISS in house
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   - restart metformin outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   -          offered nicotine patch, pt refused. Offer again
   -          motivated to quit per SW consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with NSTEMI. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient has several medical issues:

1. Coronaries: She has subacute NSTEMI with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD and critical left main stenosis. She has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking.
2. Pump: She has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure with diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction, with an ejection fraction of 30% on echocardiogram. She has elevated pulmonary wedge pressures and pulmonary arterial pressures, indicating chronic pulmonary hypertension.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: She is a current smoker with decreased breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase on lung examination, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her elevated wedge pressure could worsen pulmonary hypertension, and she may have cor pulmonale from malignancy.
4. Diabetes Mellitus II: She has non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c of 7.0%, and needs better glucose control.
5. Rhythm: She has sinus rhythm with a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block on electrocardiogram (EKG), which may be due to decreased coronary supply to the AV node.
6. Hypertension: She has hypertension, and is taking beta-blockers and captopril.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: She has known PVD and is status post right iliac stent, with stable exertional calf claudication.
8. UTI: She had a positive urine culture, but the blood culture grew out Coag-neg staph, likely due to contamination.
9. Med non-compliance: She has been non-compliant with her medications, and a social worker consultation is recommended.
10. Smoking Cessation: She is motivated to quit smoking and has been offered nicotine patches, but has refused them.

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin gtt
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Aspirin
* Beta-blockers
* High-dose statin
* ACE inhibitor
* Captopril
* Metformin
* Ciprofloxacin

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 139/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 78 K/uL

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 169 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 37.4%
* Platelet count: 78 K/uL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and she may develop further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
* Pulmonary complications: The patient's chronic pulmonary hypertension and COPD may lead to further pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure or pulmonary embolism.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal impairment, and she may develop further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a urinary tract infection, and she may develop further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
* Medication non-compliance: The patient's history of medication non-compliance may lead to further complications, such as medication toxicity or inadequate treatment of her underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL (0.0-0.1 ng/mL)
* Glucose: 169 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, with a diminished right DP pulse and left DP pulse
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, with crackles in the right mid-field and left base
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, with present bowel sounds
* Extremities: No edema, no cyanosis, no clubbing

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to CAD
* Heart failure exacerbation due to CHF
* Sepsis or infection due to the presence of crackles in the chest
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxia
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes
* Bleeding or thrombotic complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Renal failure due to acute kidney injury

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.  She was taken to the OR and
   therefore off of the CCU service on [**2180-2-18**]. She has several issues;
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - To OR today
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - patient given smoking cessation information by SW
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Serial CXR and physical exams
   show significant right effusiom  Her sx of SOB is likely secondary to
   heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates; patient may need home 02, reassess post-op
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - communicate these plans to CSURG team
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%. Patient not
   likely to benefit from intensive glucose control. However, needs better
   control than currently managing.
   - continue RISS in house
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   - restart metformin outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   -          offered nicotine patch, pt refused. Offer again
   -          motivated to quit per SW consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.
