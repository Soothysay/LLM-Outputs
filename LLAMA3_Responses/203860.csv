   Please see MICU admission note dated [**2149-9-24**] for further details.
   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 7685**] is a 63 y.o. M with ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **] on [**2149-9-24**] for altered
   mental status.  He had two recent admissions prior to this one.
   [**Date range (1) 8028**]: R axillary hematoma requiring massive blood product
   resuscitation.  [**Date range (1) 8675**]: R groin bleed which achieved hemostasis with
   DDAVP and aminocaproic acid.  On the evening of [**9-22**], pt's sister noted
   that he had normal mental status.  The following morning, he appeared
   confused and was not eating and had not used the bathroom.  Symptoms
   progressed and by the evening, he was awake but not verbal.  Sister
   brought him to [**Name (NI) **].
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 97  HR 73  BP 127/68  RR 24  100% 2 L NC.
   Paracentesis negative for SBP. RUQ US which showed GB sludge and patent
   portal vein. Received 1 L NS and flagyl 500 mg IV x 1. Transferred to
   ICU.
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8676**], pt was in MICU [**Location (un) **].  His altered mental status was
   treated with lactulose and etiology likely medication noncompliance.
   ARF of 1.9 from baseline 0.8.  Fluid boluses given with resolution of
   ARF.  Also had BRBPR in ED, and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts monitored. Ceftriaxone IV was
   continued for ppx.  On [**9-26**], the patient was transferred to Liver
   Kidney Service ([**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 10).
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8677**], the [**Hospital 1050**] hospital course was the following:
   * Altered mental status: treating with lactulose, rifaximin
   * ARF: first thought to be pre-renal [**2-10**] poor po intake, held
   diuretics, and resolved.  Re-initiated diuretics on [**9-28**], lasix held on
   [**10-1**].  Cr trended up on [**10-5**] and treated with albumin challenge x 2
   days and transfused with pRBC. Cr continued to trend up. Started
   midodrine and octreotide on [**10-15**]. Renal consulted, felt likely HRS and
   less likely abdominal compartment syndrome.
   * BRBPR: NG without gross blood. Hct trended.
   * Metabolic acidosis: Non AG noted which was felt to be due to diarrhea
   and r/o RTA Type 2 with urine lytes.
   * Diarrhea: Around [**2149-9-30**], pt noted to have 2.5 L watery profuse stool
   with c. diff negative. [**Month/Day/Year **] negative, CT abdomen/pelvis completed.
   * UTI: treated with ciprofloxacin x 3 days ([**10-2**])
   * Ileus/Pseudo-obstruction: On [**10-5**], CT showed stable ileus of
   transverse colon on CT and KUB. Pt still passing flatus. Flex sig on
   [**10-6**] with bowel decompression. Pt initially refused rectal tube, but
   then consented on [**10-8**]. Pt's HR and BP too low for neostigmmine.
   Surgery consulted. Started on reglan [**10-13**] without significant
   improvement.
   * Coagulopathy: Multifactorial from lupus anticoagulant and liver
   dysfunction. Large chest wall hematoma found on CT on [**10-15**].  Monitored
   with serial Hcts.
   .
   On [**10-18**], MICU consult was requested due to patient's altered mental
   status secondary to high dose narcotic. Narcan x 3 given with
   improvement in mental status.  ICU transfer deferred.
   .
   On [**10-19**], pt was transferred to MICU service due to traumatic foley
   placement with bleeding from site as well as bleeding from 3 L
   abdominal paracentesis site that was performed on [**10-18**].  He was given
   1 pRBC and 4 FFP.  Patient was called out to the floor on [**10-20**].
   .
   On [**10-26**], transferred back to the MICU for melenic stool and HCT drop
   from 23>17.  Pt without complaint.  Brown stool shortly after arrival
   but hematoma on posterior chest wall appears expanded

   lengthy hospital course c/b colonic pseudo-obstruction, traumatic foley
   placement, and bleeding from paracentesis site, transferred to ICU for
   hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Blood Clot  PR x 1: Stable. H/o hemorrhoids on previous colonsocopy
   and varices on EGD (4 grade 1). Also with lupus anticoagulant.   Had
   bowel movement after coming to the ICU which was guaiac negative.
   - trend Hct, type and screen, transfuse for Hct < 22
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Has underlying liver disease as well as lupus
   anticoagulant positive.  Pt also with bleeding from abdominal para site
   and s/p traumatic foley placement
   - s/p vitamin K po x 1
   - FFP for INR > 2
   - Transfuse for HCT<22
   - Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given, repeat PRN
   - s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - Can use amicar for uncontrolled bleeding if necessary; dose 5gram
   loading dose over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - trend Hct, plt's, INR and fibrinogen q 4 hours
   - CT scan chest wall to evaluate for expansion of hematoma
   - if rebleeds into hematoma, it is unlikely that they would be able to
   intervene because a permanent bloackade was placed in the artery
   .
   # Chest Wall Hematoma: Has been stable by imaging with ? evidence of
   slow ooze by most recent CT.
   - repeat CT to evaluate for expansion of clot
   - follow clinically
   - correct coagulopathy
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one
   week.
   - serial hcts daily
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - penile u/s ordered to look for urethral tear
   .
   # Abdominal Wall Bleeding: Several small hematoma in abdomen, ascitic
   fluid w/o stigmata of bleeding, and otherwise notable for massive
   ascites.
   - correct coagulopathy as above
   - active T&S
   - transfuse for Hct<22 or active bleeding, HD instability
   .
   # Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: Has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate
   NG tube, sigmoidoscopy did not result in decompression for any
   sustained period, and high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and
   risk of heart block.
   - weekly KUBs (tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD: Not transplant candidate given active drinking.  Plans to have
   transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **].  [**Month (only) 11**] now have hepatorenal syndrome which will
   not be helped by acute blood loss
   - transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge
   - measure bladder pressures to r/o compartment syndrome as ascites
   reaccumulates
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Diarrhea - Chronic, likely combination of lactulose and
   nonobstructing ileus. Colonic ileus is stable by CT and KUB. non-gap
   metabolic acidosis continues, but still likely related to diarrhea.
   Patient ambulating to bedside commode without problems. [**Name (NI) **] negative
   for celiac disease.
   - monitor labs including lytes
   - holding lactulose for now
   - replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old male with ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis, was admitted to the ICU with acute blood loss, altered mental status, and multiple medical complications. He had a lengthy hospital course with various interventions, including paracentesis, blood product transfusions, and surgical consultations. His condition remains unstable, with ongoing bleeding from multiple sites, including the abdominal wall, urethra, and chest wall.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding from multiple sites increases the risk of hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's underlying liver disease, lupus anticoagulant, and ongoing bleeding further complicate his coagulation status, increasing the risk of bleeding and thrombotic events.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's likely diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and ongoing bleeding may exacerbate his acute renal failure, leading to worsening renal function and potential need for dialysis.
4. Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction: The patient's failure to tolerate rectal tubes, NG tubes, and sigmoidoscopy, as well as his ongoing bleeding, increases the risk of further complications, including perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. Chest Wall Hematoma: The patient's expanding chest wall hematoma may require surgical intervention to prevent further bleeding and potential respiratory compromise.
6. Traumatic Foley Placement: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the urethra may require continued bladder irrigation and serial hematocrit monitoring to prevent further bleeding and potential urethral damage.
7. Abdominal Wall Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the abdominal wall may require continued monitoring and potential surgical intervention to prevent further bleeding and potential complications.
8. Diarrhea: The patient's ongoing diarrhea may lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and potential complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
9. Mental Status Changes: The patient's ongoing sedation and potential withdrawal from narcotics may lead to further mental status changes, including agitation, confusion, and potential delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and bleeding sites.
2. Optimize coagulation parameters, including vitamin K, FFP, cryoprecipitate, and DDAVP, as needed.
3. Continue midodrine and octreotide for HRS management.
4. Monitor and manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances, including repletion of lytes as needed.
5. Consider surgical consultation for the patient's ongoing bleeding from the chest wall, abdominal wall, and urethra.
6. Continue close monitoring of the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
7. Consider serial imaging studies, including CT scans, to evaluate for expansion of the chest wall hematoma and abdominal wall bleeding.
8. Continue to optimize the patient's nutrition, including TPN and repletion of lytes as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a lengthy hospital course complicated by ETOH cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has been transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia. The patient has undergone several procedures, including endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley placement, and embolization of a chest wall hematoma. He is currently receiving supportive therapy with blood and factors, but his condition is complicated by comorbid ESLD coagulopathy and likely DIC.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's coagulopathy and likely DIC put him at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's cirrhotic liver and basal atelectasis may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his coagulopathy and bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's likely HRS and acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed promptly.
4. Infection: The patient's coagulopathy and ESLD increase his risk for infection, particularly urinary tract infections, which could be complicated by his traumatic foley placement.
5. Liver failure: The patient's ESLD may progress to liver failure if not managed promptly, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's colonic pseudoobstruction and esophageal varices may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coagulopathy and ESLD may increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will be monitored closely for signs of bleeding, infection, and organ failure. His coagulopathy will be managed with FFP, cryo, and DDAVP as needed. His ESLD will be managed with lactulose and cipro for prophylaxis against encephalopathy. His acute renal failure will be managed with midodrine and octreotide. His colonic pseudoobstruction will be monitored with serial KUB studies. His traumatic foley placement will be managed with bladder irrigation and urology follow-up. His code status will be discussed with the patient and family, and his goals of care will be re-evaluated regularly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) due to ethanol cirrhosis, who has been hospitalized for a lengthy period due to complications such as colonic pseudo-obstruction, traumatic foley placement, and bleeding from paracentesis site. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient has an underlying liver disease, lupus anticoagulant, and bleeding from abdominal para site and traumatic foley placement, which increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Chest Wall Hematoma: The patient has a stable chest wall hematoma, but there is a risk of rebleeding, which may not be amenable to intervention due to the permanent blockade of the artery.
3. Traumatic Foley Placement: The patient continues to ooze from the urethra around the catheter, and there is a risk of urethral tear.
4. Abdominal Wall Bleeding: The patient has several small hematomas in the abdomen, ascitic fluid without stigmata of bleeding, and massive ascites, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: The patient has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate NG tube, and has a high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and risk of heart block.
6. ESLD: The patient is not a transplant candidate due to active drinking, and has hepatorenal syndrome, which will not be helped by acute blood loss.
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome, and is being treated with midodrine and octreotide.
8. Diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea, likely due to lactulose and non-obstructing ileus, and has a non-gap metabolic acidosis.
9. Mental Status: The patient has mild asterixis and is at risk for worsening mental status due to opiate sedation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 55 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100%, and he is on no respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 66 K/uL
* INR: 17.0
* Fibrinogen: 83 mg/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Calcium: 10.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT Chest Wall: Stable chest wall hematoma with no evidence of expansion.
* CT Liver: Cirrhotic liver and large abdominal ascites.

The patient's medications include:

* Vitamin K
* FFP
* Cryoprecipitate
* DDAVP
* Midodrine
* Octreotide
* Ranitidine
* Lactulose
* TPN

The patient's plan includes:

* Trending Hct, type and screen, and transfusing for Hct < 22.
* Correcting coagulopathy with vitamin K, FFP, and cryoprecipitate.
* Monitoring labs, including Hct, plt's, INR, and fibrinogen, every 4 hours.
* Repeat CT scan chest wall to monitor for rebleeding.
* Urology follow-up to evaluate for urethral tear and bleeding.
* Liver follow-up to monitor for ESLD.
* Transplant evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: TPN
* Glycemic control: Monitoring glucose levels and adjusting insulin as needed.
* Lines: 20-gauge and 22-gauge IV lines.
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker, and VAP prophylaxis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He was admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia. The patient has a lengthy hospital course with multiple complications, including bleeding from paracentesis site, chest wall hematoma, traumatic foley placement, and colonic pseudoobstruction. He is currently being treated for acute blood loss anemia, coagulopathy, UTI, and colonic pseudoobstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has a history of bleeding from paracentesis site and chest wall hematoma, and is at risk for further bleeding due to his coagulopathy and ongoing blood loss.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for enterococcus and is at risk for sepsis and organ failure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his acute blood loss anemia and potential sepsis.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and is at risk for further deterioration due to his ongoing liver disease.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his positive urine culture and ongoing blood loss.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy and is at risk for further bleeding due to his ongoing liver disease and potential sepsis.
7. Colonic Pseudoobstruction: The patient has a history of colonic pseudoobstruction and is at risk for further complications, including perforation and sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level closely and transfuse blood and factors as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 21%.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and transfuse FFP and cryoprecipitate as needed to maintain a normal INR and fibrinogen level.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels, and consider adjusting his fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of his urine culture and sensitivity testing.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider adjusting his treatment plan if his liver function deteriorates further.
6. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center if his liver disease is deemed to be severe and irreversible.
7. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to ensure that he is receiving the best possible care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ETOH cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He is currently in the ICU due to acute blood loss anemia, hemodynamic instability, and multiple comorbidities.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 61 bpm
* Blood pressure: 113/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 23.1%
* Platelet count: 66,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 6.3 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL

The patient has a history of multiple complications, including:

* Hepatorenal syndrome
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Hemorrhage/hematoma, procedure-related
* Traumatic foley placement
* Colonic pseudoobstruction
* ESLD (end-stage liver disease)
* Acute renal failure
* FEN (fluid and electrolyte imbalance)

The patient's current plan includes:

* Monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels every 8 hours
* Active transfusion of blood and factors for hemoglobin < 21% and < 25% if active rebleeding
* Guaiac stools
* Appreciation of surgery involvement
* Coagulopathy management with ddavp and amicar as needed
* FFP and cryoprecipitate for INR > 2 and fibrinogen < 100
* DDAVP given in the past, repeat as needed
* Consider amicar for uncontrolled bleeding
* Empiric ampicillin for UTI
* Foley catheter continued for at least one week
* Bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
* Urology follow-up
* KUB to evaluate for colonic pseudoobstruction
* ESLD management with cipro for sbp ppx and hold lactulose given diarrhea
* Discussion of goals of care with patient and family given ongoing ETOH use
* Acute renal failure management with midodrine and octreotide
* FEN management with repletion of electrolytes as needed and readdressing TPN if PICC able to be replaced
* PPX management with H2 blocker

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding/hematoma
* Worsening of coagulopathy
* UTI progression
* Colonic pseudoobstruction worsening
* ESLD worsening
* Acute renal failure worsening
* FEN worsening
* Infection/sepsis
* Organ failure (e.g., liver, kidney, respiratory)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a lengthy hospital course complicated by ETOH cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He was recently transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia. His Hct has stabilized, but he continues to bleed from multiple sources, including the paracentesis site and the GU tract. He has a history of ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC.

The patient's current laboratory results show:

* Hct: 21.1%
* WBC: 6.3
* Plt: 66
* Cr: 2.0
* Glucose: 124
* INR: 2.1
* Fibrinogen: 130 mg/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Ca++: 10.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient is receiving supportive therapy with blood and factors, as well as empiric antibiotics for possible UTI. He has a traumatic foley placement and is at risk for UTI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to ongoing bleeding from multiple sources.
2. Development of DIC, which can exacerbate his coagulopathy and increase the risk of bleeding.
3. UTI, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Acute renal failure, which is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
5. Liver failure, which can lead to multiorgan failure.
6. Sepsis, which can arise from the patient's multiple comorbidities and risk factors.

To prevent or manage these complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and his Hct should be closely monitored and replaced as necessary. He should also receive empiric antibiotics for possible UTI, and his traumatic foley placement should be managed by urology. Additionally, his acute renal failure should be managed with midodrine and octreotide, and his liver failure should be managed with supportive care."

   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Bleeding
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-28**]
   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has a lengthy hospital course for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. He is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia.

The patient's hemoglobin has decreased from 23 to 20.5, and he has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. His coagulation parameters are abnormal, with a prolonged PT and PTT, and a low fibrinogen level. He has also developed acute renal failure, likely due to hepatic respiratory syndrome (HRS).

The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a chest wall hematoma and bleeding from the paracentesis site. He has also developed a traumatic foley placement, which continues to ooze from the urethra.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 22.3%
* Platelet count: 69,000/μL
* INR: 2.0
* Fibrinogen: 168 mg/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Monitoring of hemoglobin levels every 8 hours, and transfusing for levels less than 21%
* Active bleeding surveillance, with transfusion of blood and factors as needed
* Supportive therapy with fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate for acute bleeding
* Monitoring of coagulation parameters, with transfusion of blood and factors as needed
* Treatment of UTI with empiric antibiotics
* Continued foley placement for at least one week
* Weekly KUB read to monitor for colonic pseudoobstruction
* Hold lactulose due to diarrhea
* Discuss goals of care with patient and family given ongoing ETOH use prior to admission

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further bleeding complications due to coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC
* Development of sepsis due to UTI or other infections
* Progression of acute renal failure
* Development of liver failure or encephalopathy
* Complications related to traumatic foley placement
* Further gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophageal varices

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his hemoglobin levels, coagulation parameters, and renal function, and to provide supportive therapy as needed. It is also crucial to discuss goals of care with the patient and family given the patient's ongoing ETOH use prior to admission."

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - could also consider activated clotting factors if bleeding out of
   control
   #UTI
 positive U/A and dysuria (v. traumtized urethra), [**10-12**] UCx with
   10-100K amp-[**Last Name (un) 206**] enterococcus
   -empiric ampicilliin (cipro on board for sbp ppx) day [**3-15**]
   - UCx - no growth final, will d/c ampicillin
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one week
   - appreciate urology involvement
   - eval/treatment as above
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - urology following
   # Colonic pseudoobstruction: failed rectal tube, did not tolerate NG
   tube, s/p endoscopic decompression [**10-6**]
   - weekly KUB read looking for (pseudo)obstruction q Monday
   # ESLD
 no e/o florid encephalopathy
   -appreciate liver recs
   -d/w liver re:  cipro for sbp ppx
   -hold lactulose given diarrhea
   -discuss goals of care with patient & family given ongoing ETOH use
   prior to admission
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs, currently signed off
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / TPN and regular diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various issues, including colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. He has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, coagulopathy, and UTI. He is currently being treated with supportive therapy, including blood transfusions, FFP, and cryo.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from various sites, including the paracentesis site, chest wall, and urethra. He is at risk for further bleeding due to his coagulopathy and ongoing liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient has a UTI, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver disease may continue to worsen, leading to further complications and potential liver failure.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for PE, especially with his coagulopathy and immobility.
6. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and coagulopathy make him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
7. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and coagulopathy make him at risk for further GI bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's liver disease and coagulopathy may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive therapy, including blood transfusions, FFP, and cryo, to manage the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding.
2. Aggressively treat the patient's UTI with antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
4. Manage the patient's AKI with diuretics and monitor for signs of worsening renal function.
5. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent PE and DVT.
6. Monitor the patient's GI bleeding and consider endoscopy or surgery if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider cardiology consultation if necessary.
8. Consider involving the patient's family in goal-setting and decision-making, given his poor prognosis and ongoing liver disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - could also consider activated clotting factors if bleeding out of
   control
   #UTI
 positive U/A and dysuria (v. traumtized urethra), [**10-12**] UCx with
   10-100K amp-[**Last Name (un) 206**] enterococcus
   -empiric ampicilliin (cipro on board for sbp ppx) day [**3-15**]
   - UCx - no growth final, will d/c ampicillin
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one week
   -appreciate urology involvement
   -eval/treatment as above
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   -urology following
   # Colonic pseudoobstruction: failed rectal tube, did not tolerate NG
   tube, s/p endoscopic decompression [**10-6**]
   -weekly KUB read looking for (pseudo)obstruction q Monday
   # ESLD
 no e/o florid encephalopathy
   -appreciate liver recs
   -cipro for sbp ppx
   -hold lactulose given diarrhea
   -discuss goals of care with patient & family given ongoing ETOH use
   prior to admission
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / TPN and regular diet
   # PPX: H2blocker
   # ACCESS: 18g, 22 g; L-sided PICC
   # CODE: FULL (confirmed); will likely benefit from goals of care
   discussion, as above

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, and is at risk for further bleeding due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and lupus anticoagulant positivity, which may require ongoing support with factor concentrates and cryoprecipitate.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is at risk for acute renal failure due to hypovolemic shock and potential hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and may be at risk for further episodes due to ESLD.
5. Infections: The patient has a positive urine culture and is at risk for further infections, particularly urinary tract infections (UTIs).
6. Traumatic foley placement: The patient has a traumatic foley placement, which may lead to ongoing bleeding and discomfort.
7. Colonic pseudoobstruction: The patient has a history of colonic pseudoobstruction and may be at risk for further episodes.
8. End-stage liver disease: The patient has ESLD, which may lead to further complications and potential liver transplantation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Monitoring of hemoglobin (Hb) levels and transfusion for Hb < 21%.
2. Support with factor concentrates and cryoprecipitate for coagulopathy.
3. Antibiotics for UTI.
4. Foley catheter maintenance and bladder irrigation.
5. Weekly KUB radiographs to monitor for colonic pseudoobstruction.
6. Ongoing liver disease management, including lactulose and rifaximin.
7. Renal support with midodrine and octreotide.
8. Nutrition support with TPN and lipids.
9. Glycemic control with insulin as needed.
10. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and they are scheduled to be transferred to the floor."
