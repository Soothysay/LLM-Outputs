   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty who presents for evaluation for AVR and aggressive
   diuresis.
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous
   admission. Initially not interested in surgical repair but agreed to
   cardiac cath with valvuloplasty. This was done [**2186-3-24**]. [**Location (un) 342**] improved
   from 0.5 to 0.64 and peak to peak gradient fell by 20mmHG. Patient
   tolerated the procedure and was discharged to rehab. Given continued
   symptoms, the patient is now agreeable to AVR. The preop eval was
   performed at previous admit. Patient is hesitant to get surgery, but
   after discussion with the team and her family, she is agreeable to be
   full code until the surgery and
   - dental consult
   - preop labs (LFTs, albumin, UA, coags, CBC, CMP)
   - CT surgery is following
   - hold coumadin
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen. On
   previous discharge she was on 2L NC. She is 3L negative so far for the
   hospital stay.
   - increase lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - add acetazolamide
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Hypoxia: From pulmonary edema. patient also has some degress of
   restriction from kyphosis
   - Pulmonology consult appreciated: f/u recs
   - high flow mask, wean as tolerated
   - diurese
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - start acetazolamide
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - hold coumadin for potential surgery
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted for evaluation for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and aggressive diuresis. She has critical aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed on a previous admission and treated with valvuloplasty. She is now agreeable to AVR after discussion with the team and her family.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute on chronic systolic heart failure, requiring high-flow mask oxygen and diuresis. She has metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis, which may be due to hyperventilation during arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. She also has chronic stable COPD, atrial fibrillation, and a goiter, which was worked up extensively on a previous admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.3°C, blood pressure of 111/45 mmHg, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on high-flow mask oxygen. Her physical examination reveals a large non-tender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distension (JVD) elevated while sitting at 90 degrees, and bibasilar crackles on lung examination.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and mild hyperglycemia. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen if her diuresis is not carefully managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis may worsen if her oxygenation is not properly managed.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if her hyperventilation is not addressed.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if her rate control is not properly managed.
5. Goiter: The patient's goiter may worsen if it is not properly managed.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if her diuresis is not properly managed.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and potential sources of infection.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to her underlying medical conditions and potential medications.
10. Kidney injury: The patient is at risk for kidney injury due to her underlying medical conditions and potential medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and aortic stenosis. She was recently transferred to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory support: She is on a venti mask with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiac status: She has atrial fibrillation, and her ejection fraction (EF) is 45% likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis.
* Fluid status: She is volume overloaded, as evidenced by bibasilar crackles and elevated jugular venous distension (JVD).
* Renal function: Her creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and her urine output is 3,455 mL over 24 hours.
* Metabolic status: She has metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis.
* Neurological status: She has no focal deficits, and her cranial nerves 2-12 are grossly intact.

The patient's goals of care are to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness, and she has elected to be DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Given the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation is not well-managed.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's ejection fraction is 45%, and her aortic stenosis is severe. There is a risk of cardiac failure, particularly if the patient's fluid status is not carefully managed.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and her urine output is 3,455 mL over 24 hours. There is a risk of renal failure if the patient's fluid status is not carefully managed.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis. There is a risk of metabolic acidosis if the patient's electrolyte levels are not carefully monitored and managed.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of infection, particularly given her immunocompromised state and the presence of indwelling lines and drains.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and careful management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2186-4-16**] 11:13 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was recently transferred to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.1°C (98.8°F), HR 88 bpm, BP 101/65 mmHg, RR 21 breaths/min, SpO2 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AF with a heart rate of 88 bpm
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,660 mL of fluids and has lost 3,455 mL of fluids, resulting in a negative balance of 1,795 mL
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a venti mask and is on standby mode on the ventilator
* Physical examination: The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, JVD elevated sitting at 90 degrees, and a holosystolic murmur with loss of S2 consistent with severe aortic stenosis
* Lab results: The patient's WBC count is 8.3, Hct is 27.9, and Plt is 233

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and acute diastolic CHF may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen, leading to pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, or cardiac failure.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to complications such as seizures, muscle weakness, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, pneumonia, or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of a goiter may increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's cardiac diet and repletion of electrolytes may not be adequate to meet her nutritional needs, leading to deficiencies or malnutrition.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care should be considered:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix gtt to 20 cc/hour to manage fluid overload and hypoxia.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust diuresis as needed to prevent fluid overload.
3. Continue oxygen therapy via a venti mask and wean as tolerated to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic alkalosis and monitor for signs of worsening.
6. Continue COPD treatment and monitor for signs of exacerbation.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment as needed to prevent malnutrition.
8. Consider restarting coumadin to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's lab results and adjust treatment as needed to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty who presents for evaluation for AVR and aggressive
   diuresis.
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous
   admission. Initially not interested in surgical repair but agreed to
   cardiac cath with valvuloplasty. This was done [**2186-3-24**]. [**Location (un) 342**] improved
   from 0.5 to 0.64 and peak to peak gradient fell by 20mmHG. Patient
   tolerated the procedure and was discharged to rehab. Given continued
   symptoms, the patient is now agreeable to AVR. The preop eval was
   performed at previous admit. Patient is hesitant to get surgery, but
   after discussion with the team and her family, she is agreeable to be
   full code until the surgery and
   - dental consult
   - preop labs (LFTs, albumin, UA, coags, CBC, CMP)
   - CT surgery is following
   - hold coumadin
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen. On
   previous discharge she was on 2L NC. She is 3L negative so far for the
   hospital stay.
   - increase lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - add acetazolamide
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Hypoxia: From pulmonary edema. patient also has some degress of
   restriction from kyphosis
   - Pulmonology consult appreciated: f/u recs
   - high flow mask, wean as tolerated
   - diurese
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - start acetazolamide
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - hold coumadin for potential surgery
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted for evaluation for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and aggressive diuresis. The patient has been diagnosed with critical aortic stenosis and has undergone valvuloplasty with improved symptoms. However, she continues to experience symptoms and is now agreeable to AVR. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, requiring high-flow mask oxygen and diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
4. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances and other metabolic complications.
6. Kidney Injury: The patient's diuresis may lead to kidney injury if not properly monitored and managed.
7. Infection: The patient's increased risk of infection due to her underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospital stay.
8. Sepsis: The patient's increased risk of sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospital stay.
9. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's increased risk of cardiac arrest due to her underlying medical conditions and the need for AVR.
10. Surgical Complications: The patient's increased risk of surgical complications, including bleeding, infection, and cardiac arrest, due to her underlying medical conditions and the complexity of the AVR procedure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust diuresis and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications and consider cardioversion if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's heart failure with diuresis, oxygen therapy, and beta blockers.
4. Monitor the patient's pulmonary edema closely and consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
5. Manage the patient's metabolic alkalosis with acetazolamide and electrolyte replacement as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and adjust diuresis and electrolyte replacement as necessary.
7. Consider prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding.
8. Prepare the patient for AVR and discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with her and her family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and acute diastolic heart failure.
* Respiratory: The patient has acute respiratory failure, with a respiratory rate of 21-29 breaths per minute, and requires supplemental oxygen via venti mask.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a blood pressure of 101/65 mmHg, with a central venous pressure of 10 cmH2O, and is receiving diuretic therapy with lasix.
* Fluid balance: The patient has a fluid balance of -1,795 mL over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 3,455 mL.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and their urine output is 3,455 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.7 g/dL, and platelet count is 233 K/uL. Other laboratory results include elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and acute diastolic heart failure increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and requirement for supplemental oxygen increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output increase the risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Infectious complications: The patient's presence in the ICU increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infection.
* Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and altered mental status increase the risk of metabolic complications, such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a code status of DNR/DNI. They are receiving diuresis with Lasix at 20 mL/hour and have a repeat gas unchanged. The patient has atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and altered mental status. They have impaired skin integrity and are at risk for alkalosis, metabolic. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/65 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alkalosis, metabolic: The patient's alkalosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to muscle weakness, fatigue, and respiratory depression.
2. Heart failure, acute: The patient's acute heart failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and increased mortality.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased blood pressure, and increased risk of heart failure.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of infection, sepsis, and poor wound healing.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of delirium, agitation, and decreased cognitive function.
6. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of respiratory arrest, pneumonia, and increased mortality.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, and increased mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix at 20 mL/hour to manage fluid overload and heart failure.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely to ensure stability and early detection of any potential complications.
3. Manage the patient's alkalosis with sodium bicarbonate or other medications as needed to prevent worsening of symptoms.
4. Manage the patient's heart failure with medications and fluids as needed to prevent worsening of symptoms.
5. Monitor the patient's skin integrity closely to prevent infection and promote wound healing.
6. Manage the patient's altered mental status with medications and other interventions as needed to prevent worsening of symptoms.
7. Continue respiratory support as needed to manage acute respiratory failure.
8. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation closely to prevent worsening of symptoms and prevent stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   Multiple discussions related to patient
s goals of care and patient has
   been switched to DNR/DNI.
   - palliative care to see patient today
   - will try to coordinate family meeting today with Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - discontinue a-line
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - transition from lasix drip to 120mg PO lasix with plans to increase
   as needed
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - transition to oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload due to critical aortic stenosis. Her condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and chronic conditions.

Key findings:

* The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side and JVD elevated when sitting at 90 degrees.
* She has a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex.
* Her lungs are clear to auscultation, but limited by poor patient effort and difficulty positioning.
* Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bilateral lower extremity edema.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm and blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg.
* Her oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.
* Her laboratory results show chronic kidney disease, anemia, and mild electrolyte imbalance.
* Her medical history includes a previous valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis, which did not improve her symptoms.

Potential medical complications:

* Hypoxia: likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
* Atrial fibrillation: chronic and currently rate-controlled.
* Aortic stenosis: critical and not amenable to surgical intervention.
* Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis.
* Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: may be related to hyperventilation during arterial blood gas sampling.
* COPD: chronic and stable, but may worsen with fluid overload and hypoxia.
* Goiter: chronic and stable, but may impact respiratory function.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's goals of care are to avoid escalation of care and focus on comfort and symptom management.
* Palliative care has been consulted to help with goals of care and disposition planning.
* The patient will be weaned off the ventilator and transitioned to oral lasix as tolerated.
* Her atrial fibrillation will be continued to be rate-controlled with metoprolol.
* Her aortic stenosis will be managed with careful diuresis to avoid decreased preload.
* Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will be managed with nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen as needed.
* Her goiter will be monitored for any changes in size or function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   Multiple discussions related to patient
s goals of care and patient has
   been switched to DNR/DNI.
   - palliative care to see patient today
   - will try to coordinate family meeting today with Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - discontinue a-line
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - transition from lasix drip to 120mg PO lasix with plans to increase
   as needed
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - transition to oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.2°C, Heart rate 87 bpm, Blood pressure 104/61 mmHg, Respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distension (JVD) elevated while sitting at 90 degrees, and a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient is comfortable appearing, with limited lung sounds due to poor patient effort and difficulty positioning.
* Labs and radiology: The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine. The most recent ECHO showed an ejection fraction of 45%, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to CHF and aortic stenosis.
* Atrial fibrillation: Chronic, currently rate-controlled with coumadin and metoprolol.
* Aortic stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal improvement after valvuloplasty.
* Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2 requirement has now improved markedly.
* Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
* COPD: Chronic, stable, not severe.
* Goiter: Chronic, stable.

The patient's goals of care are to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life, with a focus on comfort care. The patient has been switched to DNR/DNI and has been referred to palliative care for assistance with goals of care and disposition planning."

   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. Her goals of care are to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness, and she has chosen to be DNR/DNI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.2°C, HR 87 bpm, BP 104/61 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 96%
* Respiratory support: nasal cannula oxygen
* Cardiac status: atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis
* Renal function: creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, BUN 27.4 mg/dL
* Fluid balance: 2,135 mL fluid deficit over the past 24 hours
* WBC count: 8.3 K/uL
* Hct: 27.9%
* Plt: 233 K/uL
* Electrolytes: Na 137 mmol/L, K 4.7 mmol/L, Cl 105 mmol/L

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening heart failure: Given the patient's severe aortic stenosis and acute on chronic systolic heart failure, there is a high risk of worsening heart failure, which can lead to further fluid overload and respiratory compromise.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic COPD and respiratory acidosis increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly if her oxygenation levels deteriorate.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's hyperventilation and diuresis may exacerbate her metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to further respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to further cardiac instability and increased risk of stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and immobility increase her risk of developing thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's fluid overload and diuretic therapy may worsen her kidney function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and inadequate nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions and increase her risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   After multiple discussions yesterday, patient would like to be DNR/DNI
   given limited ability for meaningful recovery and patient
s wishes to
   avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness.
   - Palliative Care consult to assist with goals of care and discharge
   planning
   Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload
   related to CHF and aortic stenosis. No other evidence of pneumonia.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - diurese with goal 2L negative today
   Aortic Stenosis: Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission
   with minimal improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical
   candidate for AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   CHF: Acute on Chronic, systolic. Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45%
   likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Patient is clearly volume
   overloaded on exam, and is now requiring high flow mask oxygen.
   - continue lasix gtt to 20cc/hour so long as systolic tolerates
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: part of the
   alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG. Metabolic alk likely
   contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD: chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate controlled
   - consider restarting coumadin
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. She has been experiencing hypoxia, likely related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and critical aortic stenosis. She is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is being managed with diuretics and beta blockers. She has also been diagnosed with metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis, and is being treated with nebulizers and supplemental oxygen for her COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged hospitalization and prolonged illness: The patient's wishes to avoid prolonged hospitalizations or prolonged illness may lead to a decreased quality of life and increased risk of complications.
2. Decreased preload: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and CHF may lead to decreased preload, which can further compromise her cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and increased risk of sepsis.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and increased risk of sepsis.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may lead to complications such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and increased risk of seizures.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and increased risk of sepsis.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and increased risk of sepsis.
8. Goiter: The patient's goiter may lead to complications such as thyroid storm, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of sepsis.
9. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and increased risk of sepsis.
10. Decreased quality of life: The patient's chronic illnesses and limited treatment options may lead to a decreased quality of life and increased risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient is in the ICU with acute diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure.
* They have a history of aortic stenosis and are experiencing alkalosis, which is likely due to the use of diuretics.
* The patient's mental status is altered, but it is not delirium.
* They have impaired skin integrity, and their peripheral vascular examination is not assessed.
* The patient is receiving IV metoprolol and furosemide, and their dose of furosemide has been decreased due to low blood pressure.
* The patient is refusing PO medications, and their family has been consulted regarding the patient's goals of care.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% and an ABG showing a pH of 7.41 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 263.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening heart failure due to continued diuretic therapy
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to the use of diuretics
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's altered mental status and the use of anticoagulant therapy
* Potential for further respiratory compromise due to the patient's acute respiratory failure
* Risk of sepsis or infection due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and altered mental status
* Potential for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and underlying heart disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Goals of Care
   Multiple discussions related to patient
s goals of care and patient has
   been switched to DNR/DNI.
   - palliative care to see patient today
   - will try to coordinate family meeting today with Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   - discontinue a-line
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - transition from lasix drip to 120mg PO lasix with plans to increase
   as needed
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with metoprolol
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   - will continue to diurese carefully given risk of decreased preload
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - transition to oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis, who was transferred to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 92/46 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 91%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is net negative 1.8L over the past 24 hours, with a total fluid input of 1,705 mL and a total fluid output of 3,640 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 91%.
* Physical examination: The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distension elevated while sitting at 90 degrees, and 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.
* Labs: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 261 K/uL, creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL, and lactic acid is 0.8 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications are:

* Hypoxia: likely multifactorial, related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate-controlled with metoprolol and coumadin.
* Aortic stenosis: critical, with minimal improvement after valvuloplasty and no surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement.
* Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: with an ejection fraction of 45%, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis.
* Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: likely due to hyperventilation during arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and contraction alkalosis from hydrogen ion loss during diuresis.
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): stable, not severe.
* Goiter: chronic, stable.

The patient's goals of care are to transition to hospice care when needed, with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status. The patient's care plan includes:

* Discontinuing the lasix drip and transitioning to oral lasix with plans to increase as needed.
* Weaning oxygen as tolerated.
* Continuing rate control with metoprolol.
* Monitoring I/Os.
* Transitioning from intravenous (IV) to oral medications.
* Continuing beta blockers.
* Monitoring for metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis.
* Continuing COPD management with nebulizers and supplemental oxygen.
* Monitoring for goiter and its potential impact on the patient's condition.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, requiring careful management to address her various medical complications and potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. She has been diagnosed with critical aortic stenosis and is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Her current condition is characterized by hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic CHF, and metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and critical aortic stenosis may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's chronic illnesses and recent hospitalization may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may worsen, leading to renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient's immobility and poor nutrition may increase the risk of skin breakdown.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor nutrition may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
8. Infection: The patient's chronic illnesses and recent hospitalization may increase the risk of infection.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis may worsen, leading to metabolic acidosis.
10. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and critical aortic stenosis may lead to hemodynamic instability.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's goals of care are to receive palliative care and be discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The patient's current condition is characterized by hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic CHF, and metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis. The plan is to continue lasix PO, appreciate pulmonary recs if tolerated, wean O2 as tolerated, and continue coumadin and rate control with metoprolol. The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in her condition and will be discharged to a rehabilitation facility if a bed becomes available."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their health status and potential medical complications:

Patient's Status:

* The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and aortic stenosis.
* She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
* The patient has a poor prognosis and is DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize.
* She has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, which is chronic and stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Hypoxia: The patient has a high risk of hypoxia due to her kyphosis, fluid overload related to CHF and aortic stenosis. She is currently on oxygen therapy, but her oxygen requirement has improved markedly.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic AFib, which is currently rate-controlled with metoprolol. However, there is a risk of AFib-related complications, such as stroke or embolism.
* Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which is not surgically correctable. This increases her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Systolic CHF: The patient has acute on chronic systolic CHF, which is likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis. This increases her risk of cardiac complications and fluid overload.
* Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic alkalosis likely due to hyperventilating during ABG, which may be exacerbated by her chronic respiratory acidosis.
* COPD: The patient has chronic COPD, which may exacerbate her respiratory acidosis and increase her risk of respiratory complications.
* Goiter: The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, which may cause respiratory symptoms or complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest
* Respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or exacerbation of COPD
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or embolism
* Metabolic complications, such as metabolic alkalosis or acidosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. Her current condition is critical aortic stenosis, and she is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement. She has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and her echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 45%. She is volume overloaded and has a large non-tender goiter on the right side.

The patient has been prescribed palliative care recommendations, including seroquel for nightmares and morphine for symptom control, but she and her family did not want to use them. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with coumadin and metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fluid overload can lead to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by her atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis.
2. Heart failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure can worsen, leading to further fluid overload and decreased cardiac output.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to further heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis can worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis and further complications.
5. Goiter-related complications: The patient's large non-tender goiter on the right side can cause compression of surrounding structures, leading to respiratory or cardiac complications.
6. DVT: The patient's anticoagulation with heparin for DVT prophylaxis can increase her risk of bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and chronic medical conditions make her susceptible to infection, which can be life-threatening.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status can worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and critical aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has a large, non-tender goiter on the right side of her neck, which is likely chronic and stable. She also has jugular venous distension (JVD) elevated when sitting at a 90-degree angle, which suggests right atrial pressure elevation.

The patient's cardiac examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex, consistent with critical aortic stenosis.

The patient's lung examination is limited by poor patient effort and difficulty positioning, but she has bilateral crackles (CTAB) in the lung fields.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen (NTND) with a positive bowel sound (bs).

The patient's extremities show bilateral 1+ pitting edema to the knees.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 8.3-7.6-7.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 27.9-27.4-26.9%
* Platelet count (Plt): 233-262-261 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3-1.3-1.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 44-45-44 mmHg
* Glucose: 95-94-95-126-115 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Critical aortic stenosis
* Atrial fibrillation
* Chronic heart failure (CHF)
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Hypertension
* Goiter

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypoxia: likely multifactorial, related to kyphosis, fluid overload, and CHF
* Atrial fibrillation: chronic, currently rate-controlled
* Aortic stenosis: critical, with minimal improvement after valvuloplasty
* Acute on chronic systolic CHF: likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis
* Metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis: likely due to hyperventilation during ABG and contraction alkalosis from H+ loss during diuresis
* COPD exacerbation: chronic, stable, but may worsen with increased respiratory load
* Goiter: chronic, stable, but may cause respiratory compromise if enlarged

The patient's goals of care are DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize, and her family has been informed of her wishes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU due to acute decompensation. The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, jugular venous distension (JVD) elevated while sitting, and a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and apex. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently in AF rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's respiratory support is limited due to poor patient effort and difficulty positioning.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet count (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, and the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Ineffective coping
2. Alkalosis, metabolic
3. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute
4. Aortic stenosis
5. Impaired skin integrity
6. Altered mental status (not delirium)
7. Atrial fibrillation (AF)
8. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of heart failure due to elevated lactate levels and decreased cardiac output
2. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased renal perfusion and elevated Cr levels
3. Progression of aortic stenosis, leading to further cardiac compromise
4. Increased risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility
5. Further decline in mental status due to continued metabolic alkalosis and potential electrolyte imbalances
6. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory support and potential pulmonary edema
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and potential hypercoagulable state"

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute diastolic heart failure. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient has been experiencing delirium at night, which was managed with 12.5mg of seroquel, but they did not want to continue with the medication. They also had some difficulty with symptom control, which was addressed with 2.5mg of PO morphine, but this was also declined.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.3, hemoglobin of 27.9, platelet count of 233, and creatinine of 1.3. Their blood glucose level is 95 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, metabolic alkalosis, acute diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygenation and increased risk of respiratory arrest.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, and decreased ability to respond to medical treatment.
4. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase their risk of infection, which could worsen their overall condition.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and acute diastolic heart failure may lead to hemodynamic instability, which could worsen their overall condition.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney injury, which could worsen their overall condition.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, and decreased ability to respond to medical treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo f with h/o HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty transferred to the CCU for management of shortness of
   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Given minimal chance for improvement at this point and patient
s goals
   and wishes, patient is DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize.
   Goals of Care
   Patient is  DNR/DNI / Do not hospitalize. Patient continues to be clear
   about these wishes
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   - discharge to rehab today
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - continue lasix 120mg PO daily
   - O2 for comfort
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with 25mg toprol XL
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   -will continue to gentle diurese for improved respiratory status and
   comfort
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - continue oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient appears very comfortable, a bit sleepy.  Plans of care
   previously outlined and are consistent with the patient's wishes for no
   aggressive care.  Palliative care recs appreciated.  Will transfer to
   rehab facility today with prn Seroquel and morphine, as well as on
   chronic warfarin.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and critical aortic stenosis. She was transferred to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload. Her goals of care are to be DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize, and she has been cleared about these wishes. The patient is experiencing hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Worsening Heart Failure:** The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure may worsen, leading to further fluid overload, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's fluid overload may lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, and further exacerbation of heart failure.
4. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to metabolic acidosis, which can exacerbate her heart failure and respiratory status.
6. **Infection:** The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and urinary catheters increase her risk of infection, which can worsen her overall condition.
7. **Thromboembolic Events:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and immobility increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
8. **Nutritional Deficits:** The patient's poor nutritional status and lack of appetite may lead to further malnutrition, which can worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue diuresis with caution to manage the patient's fluid overload and improve her respiratory status.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac output and adjust her medications accordingly.
3. Continue to manage her atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.
5. Continue to manage her metabolic alkalosis with close monitoring and adjustment of her medications.
6. Provide stress ulcer prophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
7. Continue to provide palliative care and support the patient's goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
   Given minimal chance for improvement at this point and patient
s goals
   and wishes, patient is DNR/DNI/Do not rehospitalize.
   Goals of Care
   Patient is  DNR/DNI / Do not hospitalize. Patient continues to be clear
   about these wishes
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   - discharge to rehab today
   Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial related to kyphosis, fluid overload related to
   CHF and aortic stenosis.
   - continue lasix 120mg PO daily
   - O2 for comfort
   Atrial fibrillation
   Chronic, currently rate controlled
   - continue coumadin for now
   - continue rate control with 25mg toprol XL
   Aortic Stenosis
   Diagnosed with critical stenosis on previous admission with minimal
   improvement s/p valvuloplasty. Patient is not a surgical candidate for
   AVR
   -will continue to gentle diurese for improved respiratory status and
   comfort
   Acute on Chronic, systolic CHF.
   Most recent ECHO showed EF of 45% likely secondary to severe aortic
   stenosis. Patient is clearly volume overloaded on exam, although her O2
   requirement has now improved markedly.
   - continue oral lasix
   - caution with diuresis as patient is likely very preload dependent
   - continue beta blocker
   - monitor I/Os
   Metabolic Alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis:
   Part of the alkalosis may be from hyperventilating during ABG.
   Metabolic alk likely contraction alk from h+ with loss diuresis
   - continue to monitor
   COPD
   Chronic, stable, not severe
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   Goiter: Chronic, stable. Worked up extensively on previous admission.
   See prior discharge summary for full details.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU for management of shortness of breath and fluid overload in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a large non-tender goiter on the right side, and her jugular venous distension is elevated while sitting at 90 degrees. She has a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a blowing systolic murmur at the apex. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, but her effort is limited by poor patient positioning.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated creatinine, and metabolic alkalosis with coexisting respiratory acidosis. Her platelet count is slightly low, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated.

The patient's goals of care are to be DNR/DNI and not to be rehospitalized. She is receiving palliative care recommendations, including 12.5mg of seroquel for nightmares and 2.5mg of PO morphine for symptom control. She is also receiving lasix 120mg PO daily for fluid overload and oxygen for comfort.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's aortic stenosis and kyphosis can cause hypoxia, which can be exacerbated by fluid overload and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope.
4. Chronic heart failure: The patient's chronic heart failure can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and confusion.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and confusion.
7. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD can exacerbate symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing.
8. Goiter: The patient's goiter can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, and hoarseness.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her comfort and quality of life."
