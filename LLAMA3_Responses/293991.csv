   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver disease, who was transferred to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT and is not a candidate for anticoagulation. She is currently experiencing bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, and has a high risk of further bleeding and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's bleeding is a significant concern, and she is at risk of developing hemorrhagic shock if her bleeding is not controlled.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a result of her liver disease and is further complicated by her thrombocytopenia. This increases her risk of bleeding and other coagulation-related complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and pleural fluid cultures suggest that she may have sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of HIT and her current thrombocytopenia increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver disease is severe, and she is at risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to death.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's severe ulcerative colitis and refractory disease increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her liver disease and her pneumothorax, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and flutter increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and coagulopathy closely and consider transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and consider adding additional antibiotics if necessary.
3. Consider placing a central venous catheter to facilitate the administration of medications and fluids.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubating her if her oxygenation or ventilation becomes compromised.
5. Continue to treat the patient's atrial fibrillation and flutter with antiarrhythmic medications and consider cardioversion if necessary.
6. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy or colonoscopy to evaluate the extent of her bleeding.
8. Consider referring the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation and treatment of her pneumothorax."

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Abdominal CT: CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus,

   at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent, however.
   Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn: intra-abdominal,
   paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small bowel thickening
   (likely related to ascites and venous congestion from splanchnic
   thrombus).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn: intra-abdominal,
   paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small bowel thickening
   (likely related to ascites and venous congestion from splanchnic
   thrombus).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and portal vein thrombosis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT, and platelet transfusion is contraindicated. She has been treated empirically for sepsis and SBP, and has developed DIC with a prolonged INR. She has also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and has been treated with fluids and IVF. She has a central venous line (CVL) and two peripheral IV lines (22 and 20 gauge). She is receiving lactulose, rifaximin, and ursodiol, and has been switched to cefepime for broadened coverage. She has a chest tube in place and is being monitored for bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has developed DIC with a prolonged INR, which increases the risk of bleeding. She has also had episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and has a chest tube in place.
2. Infection: The patient has developed sepsis and SBP, and has a central venous line (CVL) in place, which increases the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia due to DIC and liver disease, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has developed a prolonged INR due to DIC, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Liver failure: The patient has acute decompensated hepatic failure, which increases the risk of liver failure and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient has a large left pneumothorax, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is malnourished and has a risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.
9. Infection-related complications: The patient has developed sepsis and SBP, and has a risk of developing infection-related complications such as septic shock and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to treat the patient empirically for sepsis and SBP.
3. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Consider platelet transfusion if the patient's platelet count remains low.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if her condition deteriorates.
8. Consider consulting with a liver specialist to optimize treatment.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment accordingly."

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * change ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * change ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver dysfunction. She was admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. The patient has a complex medical history, including:

1. Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC: The patient has a new portal vein thrombosis, which is a potential complication of cirrhosis. However, she is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to severe LGIB ulcerative colitis.
2. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has a platelet count of 30 and an INR of 1.8, likely secondary to liver disease. She is at risk for active bleeding, and platelet transfusion and FFP may be necessary.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement. She is at risk for recurrent pneumothorax and should be monitored closely.
4. Staph Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive SA, which may be related to a central line infection. She is receiving vancomycin and will require serial blood cultures and a chest CT to assess for staph abscesses.
5. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation/flutter, which may be related to her liver dysfunction. She is being monitored closely and will require further evaluation and management.
6. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has severe/refractory ulcerative colitis, which is being managed with prednisone and other medications. She will require ongoing management and monitoring of her disease.
7. FEN: The patient has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place for tube feed to improve her nutrition status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and may be at risk for further infections.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and she may require further interventions to prevent liver failure.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient is at risk for recurrent pneumothorax and should be monitored closely.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her bacteremia and other underlying medical conditions.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Prednisone
2. Vancomycin
3. Lactulose
4. Rifaximin
5. Ursodiol
6. Mesalamine
7. Remicade

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

1. WBC: 2.4
2. Hct: 28.0
3. Plt: 30
4. Cr: 1.0
5. TropT: 0.02
6. TC02: 34
7. Glucose: 141

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

1. Tmax: 36.3
2. Tcurrent: 35.8
3. HR: 103
4. BP: 132/74

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and severe liver disease, who was transferred to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure, anemia, and a large left pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT, and her platelet count is 13. She has been treated empirically for suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and has received FFP and cryoprecipitate. Her condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation, flutter, and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of continued bleeding from her gastrointestinal tract, which may be exacerbated by her coagulopathy and liver disease.
2. DIC: The patient's DIC may worsen if she continues to bleed, which could lead to further coagulopathy and organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient's pneumothorax may expand or worsen, which could lead to respiratory compromise and hypoxia.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver disease may worsen, leading to further decompensation and organ dysfunction.
5. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 13, which may worsen if she continues to bleed or develop DIC.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if she continues to bleed or develop DIC, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise may worsen if her pneumothorax expands or worsens, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued monitoring and management of her bleeding, DIC, and liver disease. She should receive further platelet transfusions and FFP as needed to manage her coagulopathy. Her pneumothorax should be monitored and managed with a chest tube and suction. Her atrial fibrillation should be managed with rate control agents if necessary. Her ulcerative colitis should be managed with continued prednisone and remicade. Her nutrition should be managed with tube feeds and electrolyte repletion. Her access should be managed with an EJ and PIV lines."

   61 yo women with UC and PBC admitted with MRSA bacteremia,
   pancytopenia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with blood from NG tube and blood from urine.  However Hct
   remained stable.  Seen by heme who felt that she probably had component
   of DIC, and gave recommendations for transfusion.    Got cryo for
   fibrinogen of 111.  Had AF with increased HR overnight then reverted to
   sinus rhythm.  MS poor this morning.  Is somewhat somnolent with
   decreased RR.    Received boluses of morphine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: sepsis
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   61 yo women with UC and PBC admitted with MRSA bacteremia,
   pancytopenia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with blood from NG tube and blood from urine.  However Hct
   remained stable.  Seen by heme who felt that she probably had component
   of DIC, and gave recommendations for transfusion.    Got cryo for
   fibrinogen of 111.  Had AF with increased HR overnight then reverted to
   sinus rhythm.  MS poor this morning.  Is somewhat somnolent with
   decreased RR.    Received boluses of morphine.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a component of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) along with liver disease, which increases the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is having bloody stools and is at risk of further bleeding due to the underlying coagulopathy and liver disease.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF may worsen and lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or stroke.
4. Infection: The patient has MRSA bacteremia and pleural fluid infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's primary biliary cirrhosis may worsen, leading to liver failure, encephalopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding, infection, and organ failure.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and need for mechanical ventilation.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's underlying kidney disease may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
9. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to multi-organ failure, shock, and death.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection, sepsis, and death.
11. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of mortality.
12. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's underlying cardiac condition and AF may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, which can lead to death.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction, it is essential to closely monitor their condition and provide aggressive supportive care to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   HPI:
   61 yo women with UC and PBC admitted with MRSA bacteremia,
   pancytopenia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with blood from NG tube and blood from urine.  However Hct
   remained stable.  Seen by heme who felt that she probably had component
   of DIC, and gave recommendations for transfusion.    Got cryo for
   fibrinogen of 111.  Had AF with increased HR overnight then reverted to
   sinus rhythm.  MS poor this morning.  Is somewhat somnolent with

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who was admitted with MRSA bacteremia and pancytopenia. She has been experiencing bloody stools, and her platelet count is low. She also has a component of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is at risk for bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 6 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 2.3 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 31 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* D-dimer: 2686 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 111 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Pleural fluid culture: positive for Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: shows significant pneumothorax (PTX)

The patient's medical complications include:

* Coagulopathy: likely due to DIC and liver disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): due to low platelet count and bleeding diathesis
* Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): currently in sinus rhythm
* Pancytopenia: due to chemotherapy and Remicade
* Liver function abnormalities: due to primary biliary cirrhosis
* Impaired skin integrity: due to liver disease and malnutrition
* Hospital-acquired conditions: include pneumonia, sepsis, and acute kidney injury

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Supportive care with transfusion of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and cryoprecipitate as needed
* Transfusion of platelets given gastrointestinal bleeding and low platelet count
* Observation for variceal bleeding in primary biliary cirrhosis
* Check echo today to examine valves in MRSA bacteremia
* Holding of chemotherapy and Remicade due to pancytopenia
* Continue CT to suction for hospital-acquired conditions
* Nutrition: holding tube feedings while evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding
* Glycemic control: monitoring blood glucose levels
* Prophylaxis: stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with compression stockings

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Should consider placing
   larger bore IV for resuscitation before acute decompensation occurs.
   .
   #Code status: presumed Full Code. Should discuss with family in light
   of current health issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - received platelets & 2 units PRBCs
   - pm vanc dose held
   - lasix 40 mg IV given with good response, came off non-rebreather,
   later received 250 cc NS bolus for tachycardia
   - after afternoon family visit patient decided to refuse further
   medical treatment and wanted to die.  She was A&O x3. Discussed with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6688**] who also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6379**] and transplant surgeon
   who all felt poor prognosis.  Husband called --> he and family came in
   --> family mtg and patient eventually made DNR/DNI.
   - pt. refused platelet transfusion, husband honoring that request

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs

   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source

   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and anemia, who was transferred to the ICU due to acute decompensated hepatic failure and anemia. The patient has a large left pneumothorax with concern for progression to tension pneumothorax.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.8°C, HR 104 bpm, BP 120/62 mmHg, RR 17 breaths/min, SpO2 98%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula with oxygen delivery
* Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm
* Neurological: Somnolent, not oriented, and confused
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) not mentioned
* Fluid balance: Total fluid input of 2,270 mL and total fluid output of 2,697 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 427 mL
* Blood products: 1,314 mL of blood products transfused, including platelets, PRBCs, and FFP

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Acute hepatic decompensation with portal vein thrombosis and severe liver disease
* Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, likely secondary to liver disease and sepsis
* Staph bacteremia, with a positive blood culture and a line change
* Pneumothorax, with a chest tube in place
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter, with a heart rate of up to 150 bpm
* Ulcerative colitis, with severe and refractory disease
* Pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 0.7 and a platelet count of 27

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for staph bacteremia
* Continuing lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Continuing ursodiol for cholestasis
* Monitoring for and treating sepsis
* Monitoring for and treating bleeding
* Considering TIPS for portal vein thrombosis
* Considering octreotide drip for variceal bleed
* Continuing chest tube suction for pneumothorax
* Monitoring for and treating atrial fibrillation/flutter
* Continuing stress dose hydrocortisone for ulcerative colitis
* Holding remicade and 6MP due to pancytopenia
* Monitoring for and treating electrolyte imbalances

The patient's code status is presumed to be full code, and the family should be discussed in light of the patient's current health issues. The patient's disposition is ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Received platelets & 2 units PRBCs
   - PM vanc dose held
   - Episode of respiratory distress in evening. Refused chest xray. Given
   Lasix 40 mg IV with good response, came off non-rebreather, later
   received 250 cc NS bolus for tachycardia
   - After afternoon family visit patient decided to refuse further
   medical treatment and wanted to die.  She was A&O x3. Discussed with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6688**] who also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6379**] and transplant surgeon
   who all felt poor prognosis.  Husband called --> he and family came in
   --> family mtg and patient eventually made DNR/DNI.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU with a large left pneumothorax and concerns for progression to tension pneumothorax. She has a history of HIT, and anticoagulation is not possible due to her severe LGIB. She has been treated with ceftriaxone and cefipime for suspected SBP, and rifaxamin and ursodiol for PBC.

The patient has experienced several complications, including:

* Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, likely secondary to liver disease and DIC/sepsis
* Staph bacteremia, with positive blood cultures and a changed central line
* Pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement and is currently being monitored
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter, which has resolved with IV fluids
* Ulcerative colitis, with severe/refractory disease despite steroid treatment
* Acute hepatic decompensation, with elevated bilirubin and transaminases

The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, and she has refused further medical treatment. She has been made DNR/DNI, and no further blood products or invasive procedures will be performed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Progressive liver failure and worsening coagulopathy
* Development of further infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia
* Hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest due to worsening liver failure and coagulopathy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to ulcerative colitis
* Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia or pneumothorax
* Renal failure due to worsening liver failure and coagulopathy

The patient's family has been involved in decision-making, and the patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI. The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, with plans for continued supportive care and symptom management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with underlying conditions of ulcerative colitis (UC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and MRSA sepsis. She developed respiratory distress in the setting of colloid resuscitation, which responded to furosemide (Lasix) but then developed atrial fibrillation (AF) after receiving a 250cc NS bolus. She has also refused platelets and a chest X-ray (CXR).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm
* Blood pressure: 131/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes and conjunctiva: Icteric
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Crackles in both lungs, diminished breath sounds at the bases
* Abdominal: Non-tender, distended
* Extremities: Right: 3+, Left: 3+
* Skin: Warm, jaundiced
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to name and place

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 16 K/uL
* Platelet count: 27 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 161 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02
* Troponin-T: 0.02
* D-dimer: 2686 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 144 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* LDH: 291 IU/L
* Calcium: 11.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema can worsen if not properly managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
3. MRSA sepsis: The patient's MRSA sepsis can lead to septic shock, organ failure, and death if not properly treated.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can increase the risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis can lead to portal hypertension, ascites, and other complications if not properly managed.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications.
7. Infections: The patient's underlying conditions and immunosuppressive therapy can increase the risk of infections, including MRSA sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

1. Continue vancomycin for MRSA sepsis
2. Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation
3. Diurese and manage pulmonary edema
4. Replete platelets to manage coagulopathy
5. Manage cirrhosis and portal hypertension
6. Provide nutrition support to prevent malnutrition
7. Monitor for and prevent infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]) [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   d/c at some point but not currently.
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month (only) 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]. [**Month (only) 60**] consider d/c at some point but
   not currently.
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS. D/C ISS and finger sticks to check
   blood glucose b/c have been normal (and patient is [**Month/Day (4) 617**]).
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Not to replace if fall
   out.
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no
   blood products to be given.
   .
   #Disposition: to floor for hospice/[**Month/Day (4) 617**] treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure, is critically ill and has been in the ICU for several days. She has developed a large left pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement, and has also had a significant bleed from her rectum. Her platelet count is low, and she has been treated with platelet transfusions and has been given Neupogen. She has also developed a Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin. Her liver function is impaired, and she has been given lactulose to help manage her encephalopathy. Her code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and she will not be receiving any further blood products or invasive procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the rectum: The patient's rectal bleeding is a significant concern, and it may continue to worsen if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and ongoing bleeding increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and it may continue to deteriorate if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumothorax and ongoing bleeding may lead to respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which could be life-threatening.
6. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and ongoing bleeding increase her risk of developing infections, which could lead to further complications and death.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and her ongoing bleeding may lead to malnutrition, which could exacerbate her existing medical conditions.
8. Confusion and disorientation: The patient's encephalopathy and ongoing bleeding may lead to confusion and disorientation, which could affect her ability to make informed decisions about her care.
9. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic shock, which could be life-threatening.
10. Death: The patient's underlying medical conditions and ongoing bleeding make her at high risk for death, even with optimal medical care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge).
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no

* Vital signs: T-max 36.7°C, T-current 35.6°C, HR 85 bpm, BP 128/75 mmHg, RR 17 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving IV fluids, and her hemodynamic status is being monitored closely.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,811 mL of IV fluids and 200 mL of blood products over the past 24 hours.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula, and her SpO2 is 97%.
* Lab results: The patient's WBC count is 0.9, platelet count is 16, and INR is 1.6. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute hepatic decompensation/PBC: The patient has severe liver disease, with a high probability of portal vein thrombosis.
* Thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk of bleeding.
* Staph bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
* Pneumothorax: The patient has a large left pneumothorax that has been treated with chest tube placement.
* Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient has a rapid heart rate, which is being managed with IV fluids.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue IV fluids and blood products as needed.
* Continue antibiotics for staph bacteremia.
* Continue chest tube suction for pneumothorax.
* Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation/flutter.
* Hold platelet transfusions and continue to monitor platelet count.
* Continue to monitor and manage liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
* Infection due to staph bacteremia.
* Respiratory failure due to pneumothorax.
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation/flutter.
* Liver failure due to acute hepatic decompensation/PBC.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her plan of care as needed to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge).
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU with a large left pneumothorax, acute bleed, and anemia. The patient has a history of HIT, and anticoagulation is not an option due to her severe LGIB. She has been treated empirically for SBP and sepsis with ceftriaxone and cefipime. The patient has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, likely secondary to liver disease and DIC/sepsis. She has also been diagnosed with Staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis may lead to organ failure, including renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular failure.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and acute decompensated hepatic failure may lead to worsening mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumothorax and acute bleed may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis may lead to further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.
6. Organ Failure: The patient's liver disease and acute decompensated hepatic failure may lead to organ failure, including renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's liver disease and acute decompensated hepatic failure may lead to neurological complications, including seizures and encephalopathy.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's liver disease and acute decompensated hepatic failure may lead to cardiac complications, including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and she will not receive any further blood products or invasive procedures. The patient will continue to receive lactulose for her encephalopathy, and her antibiotic regimen will be continued. The patient's family has been educated on her condition and treatment plan, and they have been informed of the potential for further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of atrial fibrillation, ineffective coping, pain control issues, impaired skin integrity, and liver function abnormalities. The patient has undergone several procedures, including central lines and arterial lines, which may have contributed to the development of line infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg. The patient is receiving antibiotics and has been administered one unit of platelets. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of line infections and abnormal liver function tests, there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's history of line infections and abnormal liver function tests increases the risk of developing further infections.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver failure, which can be life-threatening.
5. Renal failure: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests may indicate renal failure, which can be life-threatening.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's abnormal blood gas results may indicate respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and abnormal heart rhythm may increase the risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of ineffective coping and pain control issues may increase the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and medical treatment plan to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and cirrhosis, who is currently in septic shock due to MRSA bacteremia.
* The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has had no blood products or blood draws for 24 hours.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 133/77 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.7, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, platelet count of 27, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST).
* The patient is receiving vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* The patient has a history of allergies to Demerol, morphine, and heparin agents.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hypovolemic shock or hemorrhagic shock.
* Infection-related complications, such as endocarditis or septic arthritis.
* Liver failure or cirrhosis-related complications, such as ascites, encephalopathy, or bleeding varices.
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, due to the patient's history of diabetes and the use of insulin.
* Nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies, due to the patient's history of malabsorption and the use of lactulose.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's history of GIB and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
* Increased risk of infections due to the patient's history of cirrhosis and the use of immunosuppressive therapy."
