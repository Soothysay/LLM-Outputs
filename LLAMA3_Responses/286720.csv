   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Given intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on
   differential though extremely unlikely given patient is overall
   non-toxic.
   - Speak to GI re: timing of endoscopy
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <22 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   falling after hydration.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed, will d/w
   urology
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -TSH WNL and T4 pending
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) assessment. She has a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tympanic temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 96 bpm, blood pressure 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 93% on nasal cannula.
* Physical examination: The patient is thin, with coffee ground material in her mouth and dry mouth. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and her respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, and clear breath sounds.
* Laboratory results: The patient has leukocytosis (27.7 K/uL), anemia (Hct 25%), and thrombocytopenia (461 K/uL). Her creatinine level is elevated (0.9 mg/dL), but it is improving after hydration.
* ECG changes: The patient's ECG changes have improved, and she has two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts, and she has had partial evaluations for myeloid process in the past. She also has a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient's upper GIB is likely caused by ASA use or stopping PPI, which can lead to ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. She may require continued IV PPI drip and endoscopy.
2. Infection: The patient has a cat bite, which is at high risk of infection. She is being treated empirically with ampicillin-sublactam.
3. UTI: The patient has pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase, which suggests a probable UTI. She is being treated with ampicillin-sublactam, and her urine culture will be followed up.
4. Dehydration: The patient has been treated with fluids and blood, but her creatinine level is still elevated. She may require continued hydration and close monitoring of her renal function.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by blood loss and may require transfusion.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECG changes have improved, but she may still be at risk for cardiac complications due to her age and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued IV PPI drip and endoscopy to assess the upper GIB.
2. Empiric treatment with ampicillin-sublactam for the cat bite infection.
3. Treatment for probable UTI with ampicillin-sublactam.
4. Continued hydration and close monitoring of the patient's renal function.
5. Transfusion for anemia if necessary.
6. Repeat ECG and cardiac enzymes to monitor for cardiac complications.
7. Follow-up with the patient's primary care physician and endocrinologist for her chronic goiter and depression.
8. Social work involvement to find resources for the patient's daily living needs."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use.  , gastric volvulus on differential, nsaid-induced
   ulcerations.  Admitted to [**2184**] with sepsis, noted to have GIB with
   coffee ground fluid from NGT, noted to have large hiatal hernia with
   resultant intrathoracic stomach, ?predispose to UGIB and gastritis,
   hpylori(-) at that time.
   - as per GI recommendations, surgery consult given concern for gastric
   volvulus
   - GI consult, addressing need for upper GI scope
   -PPI drip
   -IV's *2
   -Ondansetron PRN for nausea
    2. leukocytosis: of note has elevated white count on admit, has had
   leukocytosis in past, notes suggest past evaluation by hematopath,
   thought c/w inflammatory response.  Possible c/w infected cat bite
   though smoldering chronic process leading to leukocytosis is not
   clearly ruled out.  No abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting
   myeloid process.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -monitor
    3. EKG changes: Given flat CE's and other transaminases as well as
   diffuse and nonspecific pattern it is unlikely this is due to acute
   MI.  Would be concerned about demand ischemia.
   -Cycle CE's
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.
   -Check UA
   -1 L NS
   -Will recheck lytes this PM with next Hct.
    6.  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -Check TSH and free T4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) assessment. The patient has a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate is 96 bpm, and blood pressure is 142/66 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL, and her hematocrit is 25%. Her white blood cell count is 27.7 K/uL, and her platelet count is 461 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mEq/L, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is thin and has a dry mouth. Her abdominal examination is normal, and her extremities are soft and non-tender.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to her history of GIB and the presence of a large hiatal hernia.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be due to an inflammatory response or an underlying myeloid process.
3. EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes may be due to demand ischemia or an acute myocardial infarction.
4. Cat bite infection: The patient has a cat bite wound that may be infected, and she is at risk for developing sepsis.
5. Dehydration: The patient is at risk for dehydration due to her history of GIB and her current fluid loss.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may be due to dehydration or pre-renal failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her age and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient will undergo an upper GI scope to evaluate the cause of her bleeding.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis will be monitored, and she will receive treatment for her cat bite wound.
* EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes will be monitored, and she will receive treatment for demand ischemia.
* Cat bite infection: The patient will receive empiric treatment for her cat bite wound.
* Dehydration: The patient will receive fluid replacement therapy to treat her dehydration.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level will be monitored, and she will receive treatment for her elevated creatinine level.
* Respiratory failure: The patient will receive oxygen therapy and respiratory support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of cat bite, which has led to suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and cellulitis at the site of the bite.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 111/47 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 93% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm (normal)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin
* Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL (normal)
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic (normal)
* Cardiovascular: Normal (S1 and S2 sounds present)
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, Right DP pulse not assessed, and Left DP pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left absent pulses, cyanosis
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time and place, movement and tone not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* White blood cell count: 27.7 K/uL (normal range: 4-11 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 461 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood glucose: 97 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: Given the patient's GIB, there is a risk of hemorrhagic shock, especially if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and cellulitis at the site of the cat bite increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the GIB is not controlled, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may require treatment to prevent complications such as seizures and brain damage.
5. RUL mass: The patient's RUL mass may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as malignancy, and requires further evaluation.
6. EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes may indicate cardiac injury or electrolyte imbalance, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. DVT: The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of DVT, which requires prophylactic measures.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and immobilization increase the risk of stress ulcer, which requires prophylactic measures.
9. VAP: The patient's mechanical ventilation and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of VAP, which requires prophylactic measures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the ICU attending note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of anemia, and his current hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL. He has also been experiencing tachycardia, which has resolved with IVF resuscitation.

The patient has a cat bite injury on his right hand, which has led to cellulitis and a possible infection. He also has a right upper lobe mass, which is likely a goiter, but may also be a malignancy, including Pancoast tumor, NSCLCA, or NHL.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to cellulitis at the site of the cat bite or a urinary tract infection (UTI). He also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5 1/2NS.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and hypernatremia. His EKG shows changes, which will be repeated once his heart rate slows. He also has a right upper lobe mass, which is likely a goiter, but may also be a malignancy.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC)
2. IVF bolus
3. Ampicillin-sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens
4. Serial hemoglobin checks
5. Large bore IV access x 2
6. GI follow-up to evaluate for endoscopy
7. [**Doctor First Name **] follow-up
8. Repeat CT scan to evaluate the right upper lobe mass
9. Thoracic, endo, or IP consults depending on the CT scan results
10. TFT's to check for thyroid function

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving IV fluids and has not been given any oral nutrition.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is 97 mg/dL, which is within normal limits.
3. Lines: The patient has two large bore IV lines, one 18 gauge and one 20 gauge.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.
5. Code status: The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

The patient's disposition is unknown, as the note does not specify where the patient will be transferred or discharged to."

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB. The patient presented with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use and has been admitted for upper GIB assessment. The chest CT scan ruled out volvulus but showed an unchanged hiatal hernia. The patient has been started on IV PPI drip and has been scheduled for an EGD today.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase, and is being treated with ampicillin-sublactam. The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and has had partial evaluations for myeloid process in the past. The patient has also been diagnosed with a cat bite infection, which is being treated empirically with ampicillin-sublactam.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 27.7, and an elevated creatinine level of 0.9. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and the patient's EKG changes are consistent with resolution of demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's GIB may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection complications: The patient's UTI and cat bite infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and cardiac enzymes may indicate cardiac damage, which could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's GIB and UTI may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated WBC count and leukocytosis may indicate a myeloid process, which could lead to neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
6. Social complications: The patient's difficulty with transportation and living alone may lead to social complications such as isolation and decreased access to medical care.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's bleeding, infection, and cardiac complications will be closely monitored and managed. The patient will be continued on IV PPI drip and will undergo an EGD today. The patient's UTI and cat bite infection will be treated with antibiotics, and the patient's cardiac enzymes will be monitored closely. The patient's social complications will be addressed through social work involvement and transportation assistance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with one day of hematemesis and was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. She has a likely upper GIB due to aspirin use and/or stopping proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, which may have caused ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), leukocytosis, and a cat bite infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper GIB may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. UTI: The patient's UTI may progress and lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could lead to complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
4. Cat bite infection: The patient's cat bite infection may spread and lead to more severe complications, such as cellulitis, abscesses, or sepsis.
5. Dehydration: The patient's dehydration may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to muscle cramps, seizures, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and treat accordingly.
2. Continue to treat the patient's UTI and monitor for signs of progression or complications.
3. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and treat accordingly.
4. Treat the patient's cat bite infection and monitor for signs of progression or complications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat accordingly.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist and urologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's conditions.
8. Consider consulting with a social worker to assist the patient with resources and transportation to medical appointments."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and gastrointestinal bleed (melena). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of infection, with a white blood cell count of 27.7 and a C-reactive protein level of 23.5. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and anxious individual with clear breath sounds and soft, tender abdomen. The patient's extremities are absent, and the skin is not assessed.

The patient's medical history is significant for a urinary tract infection and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's UTI and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding or complications such as perforation or obstruction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure or requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of developing cardiovascular instability or arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of developing electrolyte imbalance or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's UTI and gastrointestinal bleed increase the risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or bacteremia.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and there is a risk of developing nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and lack of sensation increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) and a presumptive diagnosis of upper GI bleed (UGIB) due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use after a cat bite. She has a history of cat bite infection, leukocytosis, and redness/cellulitis at the bite site. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. She has received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and is being treated with ampicillin/sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens. The patient has a goiter and is scheduled for a repeat CT scan to evaluate the size of the goiter and potential impact on the trachea. She also has ureteral stents in place due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being managed by the urology team.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's cat bite infection may worsen, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Goiter: The patient's goiter may continue to grow and potentially cause respiratory distress or obstruction.
4. Ureteral stents: The patient's ureteral stents may cause urinary tract infection or other complications.
5. DVT: The patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased due to her immobility and may require prophylactic treatment.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer may worsen, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged intubation.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels may drop, leading to hypoglycemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels may increase, leading to hyperkalemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a cat bite, coffee ground emesis, and presumed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after the cat bite and has stopped taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 94% and an ABG of pH 7.26.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and anxious individual with clear breath sounds and soft, tender abdomen. The patient's extremities are absent, and the skin is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level, with a value of 8.3 g/dL, and a decreased platelet count, with a value of 378 K/uL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a value of 27.7 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a decreased potassium level, with a value of 3.4 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show no new data, and the patient's microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Presumed UGIB due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of NSAID use after the cat bite and stopping PPI
* Plan for repeat PRBC transfusion
* PPI
* GI follow-up for endoscopy
* [**Doctor's Name**] follow-up
* Cat bite: leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site
* Amp/Sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens
* Follow for abscess formation
* Goiter: repeat CT scan as CXR showing increasingly tortuous trachea path
* Ureteral stents: placed in [**2169**] with UTI
* Urology consultation

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: IV fluids and electrolytes
* Glycemic control: insulin
* Lines: 18-gauge and 20-gauge IV lines
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection (cat bite, urinary tract infection)
* Respiratory failure (due to goiter)
* Cardiovascular instability (due to decreased blood pressure)
* Electrolyte imbalance (due to decreased potassium level)
* Thrombocytopenia (due to decreased platelet count)
* Septic shock (due to infection)
* Respiratory failure (due to goiter)

The patient's critically ill status requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a cat bite wound, coffee ground emesis, and presumed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and was taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before admission. The patient has developed leukocytosis, redness, and cellulitis at the cat bite site, which is being treated with Ampicillin/Sulbactam. She also has a goiter, which is being monitored with repeat CT scans and thyroid function tests (TFTs). The patient has ureteral stents in place due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being managed by urology.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and her ABG results are normal.

The patient's laboratory results show a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) level, which is being managed with packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Her white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, and her platelet count is normal. Her renal function is normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the cat bite site increase the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGIB is a potential complication that can lead to hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and potential respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unknown, and the use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ureteral stents and potential UTI increase the risk of developing renal failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's goiter and potential thyroid dysfunction can lead to neurological complications such as altered mental status, weakness, and numbness.
7. Infection: The patient's cat bite wound and potential cellulitis increase the risk of developing infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure."

   Imaging: CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. New left hydronephrosis. There is also slight downward displacement
   of
   the proximal pigtail portion of the right NU stent, with the pigtail
   now
   coiled within the renal pelvis rather than in upper pole calix as
   before.
   Multiple bilateral renal calculi are again demonstrated. A few 2-3 mm
   calculi
   are seen adjacent to the right NU stent, in the mid-distal portion of
   the
   ureter in the pelvis.
   2. The bladder is distended, and there is a focus of gas within the
   bladder,
   possibly related to instrumentation. Please correlate.
   3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
   4. Probable cholelithiasis.
   5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
   6. Intrathoracic stomach.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
    1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
    1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. She was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment.

The patient underwent endoscopy, which showed multiple ulcerations in the esophagus, and bilateral renal calculi were demonstrated on a CT abdomen and pelvis. She was found to have a probable cholelithiasis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and associated atelectasis.

The patient was diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), urinary tract infection (UTI), and leukocytosis. She was treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, ondansetron and metoclopramide for nausea, and transfusion for hemoglobin (Hct) <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to the presence of multiple ulcerations in the esophagus and the use of aspirin.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient is at risk of developing a more severe UTI or sepsis due to the presence of a urinary tract infection and the use of indwelling urinary catheters.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to a variety of factors, including the cat bite, UTI, or other underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
4. Dehydration: The patient is at risk of dehydration due to the presence of vomiting and diarrhea, and the use of diuretics.
5. Renal failure: The patient's bilateral renal calculi and dehydration may increase her risk of developing renal failure.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and cardiac enzymes may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy.
8. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and leukocytosis may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
9. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcerations may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal perforation.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of complications and to provide aggressive treatment for her underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the context
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hematemesis, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the context of extensive ASA use. The patient has a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB.

The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed multiple ulcerations in the GE junction, middle, and lower esophagus. The patient's diet was advanced to clear liquids and then full liquids.

The patient has a few significant laboratory results:

* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 27.7, which is potentially due to a cat bite/infection, UTI, and other reasons.
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, which are likely due to dehydration/prerenal azotemia.
* Probable UTI, given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase.
* Elevated troponin-T levels, which may indicate cardiac injury.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Cat bite infection, which is being treated with ampicillin-sublactam.
* Probable cholelithiasis.
* Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
* Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
* Intrathoracic stomach.

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Fever, which is likely due to the cat bite infection.
* Abdominal tenderness, which may be related to the GIB.
* Right radial pulse is present, but left radial pulse is absent.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued IV PPI drip for GIB.
* Two peripheral IVs, active type and cross.
* Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea.
* Transfusion for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours.
* Trending leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM.
* Monitoring for cardiac symptoms.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Septic shock due to the cat bite infection.
* Renal failure due to dehydration/prerenal azotemia.
* UTI progression.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the
   context  of high dose aspirin use.  On [**Hospital1 7**] PPI and hematemesis and
   symptomatology has largely resolved.  Hct stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, transition to PO today and will continue for the near
   future.
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 between checks, Check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
    2)  Leukocytosis:  Improving currently w/ treatment of cat bite and
   the patient
s other processes.  Still, she has long had elevated white
   counts and this deserves further work-up for primary heme process.
   -treat cat bite per belowe
   -Arrange heme f/u as o/p
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam.  Added vanc as patient is MRSA positive pending I
   and D but may d/c after culture negative.
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to trend
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that is misplaced.  Urology would
   ideally like percutaneous drain but serious question if the patient
   wants at home and no indication that this is a procedure she needs
   immediately.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. New left hydronephrosis. There is also slight downward displacement
   of
   the proximal pigtail portion of the right NU stent, with the pigtail
   now
   coiled within the renal pelvis rather than in upper pole calix as
   before.
   Multiple bilateral renal calculi are again demonstrated. A few 2-3 mm
   calculi
   are seen adjacent to the right NU stent, in the mid-distal portion of
   the
   ureter in the pelvis.
   2. The bladder is distended, and there is a focus of gas within the
   bladder,
   possibly related to instrumentation. Please correlate.
   3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
   4. Probable cholelithiasis.
   5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
   6. Intrathoracic stomach.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the
   context  of high dose aspirin use.  On [**Hospital1 7**] PPI and hematemesis and
   symptomatology has largely resolved.  Hct stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, transition to PO today and will continue for the near
   future.
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 between checks, Check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
    2)  Leukocytosis:  Improving currently w/ treatment of cat bite and
   the patient
s other processes.  Still, she has long had elevated white
   counts and this deserves further work-up for primary heme process.
   -treat cat bite per belowe
   -Arrange heme f/u as o/p
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam.  Added vanc as patient is MRSA positive pending I
   and D but may d/c after culture negative.
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to trend
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that is misplaced.  Urology would
   ideally like percutaneous drain but serious question if the patient
   wants at home and no indication that this is a procedure she needs
   immediately.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hematemesis. She has a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient has multiple ulcerations in the GE junction, middle, and lower esophagus, which is causing her hematemesis.
* She has bilateral renal calculi, new right hydronephrosis, and mild displacement of the proximal pigtail portion of the right NU stent.
* The patient has a distended bladder with a focus of gas within it, possibly related to instrumentation.
* She has extensive colonic diverticulosis and probable cholelithiasis.
* The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
* She has an intrathoracic stomach.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 27.7, 23.5, 18.6
* Hct: 31.8, 29.1, 25.0
* Plt: 461, 378, 376
* Cr: 0.9, 0.9, 0.8
* Glucose: 97, 125, 91
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.7/26.0/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 53/4/, Differential-Neuts: 83.8%, Lymph: 8.8%, Mono: 4.0%, Eos: 2.9%, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuation of PPI therapy
* Treatment of cat bite with ampicillin-sublactam and vancomycin
* Monitoring for cardiac symptoms
* Trending of creatinine levels
* Probable UTI treatment with amp-sublactam, with follow-up cultures
* Urology consultation for percutaneous drain
* Endocrine follow-up for goiter
* Social work involvement to find resources for transportation

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding from the ulcerations in the GE junction, middle, and lower esophagus
* Development of sepsis or endocarditis due to the cat bite
* Worsening of the patient's kidney function due to dehydration or prerenal azotemia
* Progression of the patient's pleural effusions and atelectasis
* Development of respiratory failure due to the pleural effusions and atelectasis
* Further complications from the patient's diverticulosis and cholelithiasis
* Development of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or sepsis due to the probable UTI
* Further complications from the patient's goiter and endocrine dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 86-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI) and sepsis. She had a history of taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after a cat bite, which led to coffee ground emesis. The patient underwent upper endoscopy, which revealed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The patient's condition is complicated by a thoracic stomach, which requires surgical correction, as recommended by the GI team.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics to cover MRSA and cat bite pathogens, as well as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. She has also received IV fluids and has been monitored for fluid balance, vital signs, and laboratory results.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, an elevated white blood cell count, which may be indicative of infection. Her urine culture is positive for MRSA, and she has been prescribed antibiotics to cover this infection. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her potassium level is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen. However, her extremities are absent, and she has a cat bite wound that is decreasing in size.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGI bleeding may recur or worsen if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's MRSA infection may spread to other parts of her body if not adequately treated.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney damage or failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium level may indicate an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Wound infection: The patient's cat bite wound may become infected, leading to further complications.
7. Organ failure: The patient's sepsis and infection may lead to organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, I recommend continued close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be continued to cover MRSA and other potential pathogens. The patient's thoracic stomach should be surgically corrected as recommended by the GI team. The patient's cat bite wound should be closely monitored for signs of infection, and the patient should be educated on proper wound care and infection prevention."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a cat bite wound, coffee ground emesis, and a history of taking NSAIDs. She was found to have multiple ulcers on upper endoscopy, but no active bleeding. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including Ampicillin/Sulbactam and Vancomycin, and has been recommended for surgical correction of thoracic stomach. She also has a history of chronic and dramatic increases in white blood cell count, which may be related to an underlying infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, as well as a positive MRSA screen.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient's cat bite wound appears infected, and she has a history of chronic and dramatic increases in white blood cell count, which may be related to an underlying infection. She is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of coffee ground emesis and was found to have multiple ulcers on upper endoscopy, which may be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is at risk for further bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive MRSA screen and elevated white blood cell count suggest that she may be at risk for developing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure, and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests that she may have kidney injury. Kidney injury can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of taking NSAIDs and her age may put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may be related to an underlying neurological condition, and she may be at risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F started taking NSAIDs after cat bite (site appears infected),
   presented with coffee ground emesis.
   # GIB: PUD in setting of NSAID use after cat bite and stoping PPI.  S/p
   scope
   - PPI
   - GI recommending surgical correction of thoracic stomach
   - [**Doctor First Name **] following
   # Cat bite: leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at site
   - Amp/Sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens
   - Vanc added for MRSA coverage
   - F/U I&D culture
   # Ureteral stents: Placed in [**2169**].  UTI.
   - Urology following.
   - F/U urine culture
 consider broadening GN coverage given
   instrumentation
   #Elevated WBC count: In this setting, most likely c/w infection, but
   has a history of chronically and dramatically increased WBC counts in
   the past.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] warrant heme eval on the floor or as outpatient.
   Please see resident note for remainder of plan.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a cat bite infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of chronic and dramatic increases in white blood cell count. The patient has undergone an upper endoscopy with multiple ulcers, and the results are pending. The patient has been started on antibiotics for MRSA coverage, and cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, clear breath sounds, and a cat bite wound that is decreasing in size. The patient's neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's inability to move or respond.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for a white blood cell count of 27.7, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 461. The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 97 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Infection: The patient has a cat bite infection, and the wound is not healing as expected. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient's endoscopy results are pending. The patient's bleeding may be due to the patient's use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after the cat bite.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 122/60 mmHg, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
5. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic examination is incomplete, and the patient's inability to move or respond may indicate neurologic deterioration.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney damage.
7. Wound infection: The patient's wound is not healing as expected, and the patient may be at risk for wound infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotics for MRSA coverage
2. Surgical correction of thoracic stomach
3. Follow-up with urology for UTI
4. Follow-up with heme eval for elevated WBC count
5. Monitoring for respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and neurologic deterioration
6. Monitoring for kidney damage and wound infection."
