   pulmonary infarct. Filling defects within the left upper lobe segmental
   arteries (2, 19), lingula (2, 24), and left lower lobe (2, 36)
   segmental
   arteries are also identified. There is no axillary, hilar, or
   mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a small
   left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of bowing of the
   interventricular
   septum to suggest right heart failure at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - LENIs to help determine if large lower extremity clot burden, which
   may require IVC filter if too much uterine bleeding with full
   anticoagulation
   - TTE to assess for any right heart strain in setting of large
   bilateral pulmonary embolism
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly
   #. Uterine bleeding:
   -Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5 days leading up to
   presentation to the hospital. Denies lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   - f/u OB/Gyn recsto assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding
   persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can consider a course
   medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the endometrium
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore IVs
   #. Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.
   - Ferrous gluconate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, presenting with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin. The patient is also experiencing uterine bleeding, which has been managed with Lupron and is being closely monitored by the OB/Gyn team. Her anemia is currently stable, and she is receiving ferrous gluconate supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her bilateral pulmonary emboli and systemic anticoagulation with heparin.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's uterine bleeding is a concern, particularly in the setting of full anticoagulation. Close monitoring of her hematocrit and blood pressure is essential to prevent significant bleeding.
3. Right Heart Strain: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli may lead to right heart strain, which could be exacerbated by the anticoagulation therapy. Regular monitoring of her cardiac status is necessary.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli may lead to respiratory complications such as hypoxia, respiratory failure, or pleural effusion.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of a bleeding disorder.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may lead to thrombocytopenia, which could increase her risk of bleeding.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to the ongoing bleeding and anticoagulation therapy, which could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe recovery."

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, presenting with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She was found to have extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli on a CT angiogram (CTA) without evidence of right heart strain. She is currently receiving heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and is scheduled to start warfarin when stability is more assured. The patient's uterine bleeding has been managed with Lupron, and further management is being coordinated with the OB/Gyn department. Her anemia is being treated with ferrous gluconate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Right lower lobe pulmonary infarct: The patient's imaging studies show a nodular subpleural opacity within the periphery of the right lower lobe, which may represent a small pulmonary infarct.
2. Pulmonary embolism-related complications: The patient's extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or even death.
3. Uterine bleeding: The patient's uterine bleeding may worsen or become life-threatening, especially if she becomes anticoagulated and experiences heavy bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient is receiving heparin, which may cause HIT, a potentially life-threatening condition.
6. Warfarin-related complications: The patient is scheduled to start warfarin, which may cause bleeding complications, especially if she has underlying bleeding disorders or is taking other anticoagulant medications.
7. Right heart strain: The patient's extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli may lead to right heart strain, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even death.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially pulmonary infections, due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of anticoagulant medications.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and her underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of significant bleeding. She has undergone a trans-thoracic echo and ultrasound, which showed normal left ventricular function, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient has received blood products and is actively bleeding, with a current hematocrit of 25.6. She has also undergone a TEE, which showed no atrial septal defect, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and no ventricular septal defect. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal coagulation studies.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is actively bleeding and has received blood products. There is a risk of further bleeding complications, including hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation studies are abnormal, which may indicate a coagulopathy. This could lead to further bleeding complications and increase the risk of thrombotic events.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may increase the risk of pulmonary edema and right ventricular failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient has an abnormal white blood cell count and may be at risk for infection. This could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has abnormal cardiac function, including borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This could lead to cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels and may be at risk for renal failure. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and manage her bleeding, coagulopathy, and other potential complications aggressively. Further diagnostic testing, including echocardiography and coagulation studies, may be necessary to guide management."

   Assessment and Plan
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, presenting with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without evidence of right heart strain. She is currently receiving heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and has been initiated on warfarin. Her uterine bleeding has been managed with Lupron, and further management decisions will be made in collaboration with the obstetrics and gynecology department.

Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not properly managed.
2. Uterine Fibroid Bleeding: The patient's bleeding has been managed with Lupron, but further management decisions will be made to ensure optimal treatment.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her anticoagulation therapy and immobilization in the ICU.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing an infection due to her immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrest and death.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and death.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin drip and warfarin to prevent further pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
2. Monitor the patient's uterine bleeding closely and adjust management as needed to ensure optimal treatment.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia closely and adjust management as needed to ensure optimal treatment.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory status closely and adjust management as needed to ensure optimal treatment.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and adjust management as needed to ensure optimal treatment.
6. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
7. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
8. Consider further management decisions with the obstetrics and gynecology department to ensure optimal treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - 1pm Hct stable, had episode of significant bleeding at 3:30pm, sent
   Hct and coags.  9pm Hct 25.6 from 28.4, gave 1 unit blood as still
   actively bleeding.  Had another episode of heavy bleeding in the middle
   of night. Ordered repeat Hct at 11am after seeing am labs which were
   drawn about 1 hour after blood finished.
   - Gyn: consider myomectomy vs uterine artery embolization but not yet,
   transfuse to Hct 25.  Consider preop placement of IVF filter if surgery
   necessary.  Afternoon update was that UAE would be favored over
   myomectomy.  Leupron should work within a week.  IR knows about her
   (contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 9891**], or person on-call).
   - TTE: LVEF >55%, borderline pulm hypertension, otherwise relatively

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, who presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin drip and warfarin. The patient is also experiencing heavy uterine bleeding and is being managed with Lupron and ferrous gluconate. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Complications:
	* Respiratory failure
	* Cardiac arrhythmias
	* Sepsis
	* Pulmonary hypertension
2. Uterine Bleeding Complications:
	* Hypovolemic shock
	* Anemia
	* Blood transfusion reactions
	* Infection
3. Anticoagulation Complications:
	* Bleeding complications (e.g., gastrointestinal, intracranial, or retroperitoneal bleeding)
	* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
	* Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
4. Anemia Complications:
	* Fatigue
	* Shortness of breath
	* Pale or yellowish skin
	* Decreased exercise tolerance
5. ICU Complications:
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
	* Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)
	* Pressure ulcers

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to minimize the risk of these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and iron deficiency anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and warfarin is being initiated when stability is more assured.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, ferritin of 36 ng/mL, and iron deficiency anemia is confirmed. The patient is also receiving ferrous gluconate 325 mg daily.

The patient's respiratory support is limited to oxygen delivery device, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.20, pCO2 of 20 mmHg, and pO2 of 80 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her inability to assess certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems.

The patient's medical history is significant for anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, and she has a history of bleeding in the 4-5 days leading up to presentation to the hospital. The patient has been prescribed Lupron and is being managed by the OB/Gyn department.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and iron deficiency anemia.
2. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism and potential underlying respiratory disease.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to iron deficiency anemia and potential underlying gastrointestinal disease.
4. Infection due to central lines, urinary catheter, and potential underlying immunocompromise.
5. Thrombocytopenia due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate warfarin when stability is more assured.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and ferritin levels closely to ensure iron deficiency anemia is managed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and provide bowel regimen as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count to ensure thrombocytopenia is not developing.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now, with plans to transfer to the gynecology department when her condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   - advised patient that we would like to switch from naproxen because of
   bleeding risk.
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   -check Hct at 10am with PTT
   - f/u OB/Gyn recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can
   consider a course medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the
   endometrium
   - Per Ob/Gyn would like to avoid procedure such as myomectomy or UAE;
   will not pursue unless patient transfusion resistant and unable to
   maintain Hct > 25.
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore Ivs
   #. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.
   - Ferrous gluconate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and iron deficiency anemia. She has a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding and presents with pleuritic chest pain.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.3%
* White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 5.8 x 10^9/L
* Platelet (Plt) count: 53 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: within normal range

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation
* Warfarin
* Naproxen (discontinued due to bleeding risk)
* Oxycodone
* Tylenol
* Ferrous gluconate
* Magnesium sulfate
* Potassium chloride
* Ranitidine
* Senna
* Sodium chloride 0.9% flush

The patient's physical examination is stable, with no signs of distress or organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to her anemia and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is at risk of recurrent embolism.
3. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's anemia is not fully corrected, and she may require further treatment to address iron deficiency.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but she may be at risk of electrolyte imbalance due to her medications and underlying conditions.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to her anticoagulation therapy and presence of central lines.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin
* Monitoring of Hct and platelet count
* Iron supplementation with ferrous gluconate
* Pain management with oxycodone and tylenol
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting of full anticoagulation
* Two large bore IVs for fluid management
* Regular diet for nutrition
* Prophylaxis for VAP"
