 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 CARDIAC ARREST
   This is a  23 year old Male with h.o. heroin and benzo abuse/overdose
   p/w PEA arrest after being found down likely [**1-20**] heroin overdose.
   .
   #. s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear as to the exact time pt was in PEA
   arrest. Per peripheral sources pt had witness arrest. Per [**Name (NI) 73**] pt was
   coded for 20-30 minutes receiving 3 rounds of epi, atropine. Pt
   currently paralyzed with bolus of Vecuronium, started on Fentanyl and
   Midazolam for sedation. Now on cooling protocol. Cardiac arrest team,
   Cardiology, Neurology aware of patient.
   - will cool patient for a goal of 32 degrees for next 24 hours (end 4p)
   - sedation c fent and propofol try to wean
   -dc cisatracuronium
   - will continue on 48 hours continuous EEG per cooling protocol
   .
   ##. Transient Hypotension: Pt noted to be hypotensive in the ED and
   started briefly on Levophed, likely [**1-20**] sedation medication. Pt
   currently able to keep MAPs >65. [**Month (only) 51**] again be hypotensive when he is
   cooled, will continue to monitor and bolus with LRs for a goal MAP >65.
   - monitor BPs using A-line
   - goal MAP >65
   - will bolus with NS to maintain pressures x1L cvp goal 12
   .
   ##. Ventilated/cerebral edema: Pt currently ventilated as he is on
   cooling protocol and sedated heavily. First ABG obtained when pt was
   over breathing ventilator.
   -Target pH 7.45 to cause cerebral vasocontstriction to combat cerebral
   edema.
   -consider hypertonic saline will d/w neurology
   -f/u neuro recs, greatly appreciate their advice
   .
   ##. ?Aspiration PNA: Pt noted to have course BS, CXR also shows b/l
   patchy infiltrates. Suspect aspiration PNA, will cover with broad
   spectrum abx with Unasyn.
   - continue on Unasyn
   - obtain blood cultures
   .
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: Unknown baseline but pt is young and has no history of renal
   disease, suspect this may ATN given the length of ischaemic down time.
   Pt also at risk for rhabdo given CK of ~20,000
   - Will continue to monitor urine output
   - goal >30 cc/hr, has been meeting or exceeding
   - trend Creatinine
   -continue NS at 250cc/hr to protect against rhabdo injury
   .
   ##. Shock Liver: Pt noted to have transaminitis as well as synthetic
   dysfunction, likely shock liver from length of ischaemia.
   - will continue to trend LFTs, coags
   - continue with supportive care
   .
   # RUE edema: likely from being down. could consider RUE us to r/o dvt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old male who was found down and likely overdosed on heroin. He suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated after 20-30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a goal of cooling his body temperature to 32°C for the next 24 hours. He is also sedated and paralyzed with bolus doses of Vecuronium.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, kidney injury, and cardiac enzymes, suggesting possible shock liver and acute kidney injury (ATN). His electroencephalogram (EEG) shows markedly suppressed brain activity with occasional bursts of generalized slowing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's hypodense basal ganglia and internal capsules on CT scan, along with his elevated intracranial pressure, put him at risk for cerebral edema.
2. Seizures: The patient's EEG shows suppressed brain activity, and he is at risk for seizures, particularly during the warming-up phase.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and cooling protocol may increase his risk of respiratory failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's history of transient hypotension and his current cooling protocol may increase his risk of hypotension.
5. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine and liver enzymes suggest possible ATN, which may worsen his kidney function.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level suggests possible rhabdomyolysis, which may worsen his kidney function.
7. Infection: The patient's aspiration pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count put him at risk for infection.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and elevated cardiac enzymes put him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's brain injury and elevated intracranial pressure put him at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke and brain hemorrhage.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 23-year-old male who was found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest after a suspected heroin overdose. He was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and paralyzed. He is being cooled to a goal of 32°C for 24 hours. His respiratory status is stable, with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. His hemodynamic status is stable, with a MAP of 65-70 mmHg. He has a history of heroin and benzodiazepine abuse and has a risk of developing seizures.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.3 K/uL
* Hct: 45%
* Plt: 171 K/uL
* Cr: 2.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11 ng/mL
* TCO2: 17 mmol/L
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 4542 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A HEAD CT scan showing multiple hypodensities in the basal ganglia and internal capsules bilaterally, worrisome for acute ischemia and infarction.
* No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizures: The patient has a risk of developing seizures due to the hypodensities in the basal ganglia and internal capsules, and the history of cardiac arrest.
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient has a risk of developing ATN due to the length of ischemic downtime and the possibility of rhabdomyolysis.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has a risk of developing rhabdomyolysis due to the length of ischemic downtime and the high levels of creatine kinase.
4. Shock liver: The patient has a risk of developing shock liver due to the length of ischemic downtime and the transaminitis.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to his prolonged intubation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his prolonged immobility.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer due to his prolonged critical illness.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and watch for signs of seizures.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and watch for signs of ATN.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and watch for signs of shock liver.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and watch for signs of VAP.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and watch for signs of DVT.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including sedation, paralysis, and cooling.
7. Consider obtaining an MRI/MRA of the brain to further evaluate the patient's neurological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 23-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU after being found in cardiac arrest with a 20-minute duration. He was resuscitated with drugs and shocks, and now is being treated for cerebral edema, possible aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and shock liver. He has a history of heroin overdose and bezoar.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 80/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 100%.
* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and has burst suppression background on EEG with intermittent spikes, indicating possible seizure activity.
* Laboratory results: The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis. His troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating possible kidney injury.
* Imaging studies: A CT head scan shows multiple hypodensities in the internal capsule and basal ganglia, which are worrisome for acute ischemia and infarction.
* Medications: The patient is receiving various medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and hypertonic saline.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's CT scan shows diffuse cerebral edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Possible aspiration pneumonia: The patient's initial CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK and LDH levels suggest possible rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury and other complications.
4. Shock liver: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulation studies suggest possible shock liver, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG shows burst suppression background with intermittent spikes, which may indicate ongoing seizure activity.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and Cr levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
7. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T level suggests possible cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Cooling protocol to reduce ICP and prevent further brain injury.
2. Sedation weaning to allow for more thorough neurological evaluation.
3. Anticonvulsant therapy to control seizure activity.
4. Hypertonic saline protocol to treat cerebral edema.
5. Antibiotics to treat possible aspiration pneumonia.
6. Fluid management to prevent acute kidney injury and other complications.
7. Cardiac monitoring to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
8. Neurological consultation to optimize management of ICP and cerebral edema.
9. Renal consultation to optimize management of acute kidney injury.
10. Continuous EEG monitoring to monitor for ongoing seizure activity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - continuous EEG monitoring x 48 hours, should finish this afternoon
   ##. Cerebral edema: patient with diffuse cerebral edema demonstrated on
   CT with mild sulcal effacement but maintenance of GW junction
   - continue hypertonic saline protocol q 6 hours for goal serum osm of
   320-330
   - avoid free water loads
   - consider IV mannitol to reduce ICP in setting of cerebral edema
   ##. Possible Aspiration PNA: patient intially noted to have coarse BS
   with initial CXR demonstrating bilateral patchy infiltrates
   - continue Unasyn
   - f/u cultures and CXR
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: patient with unknown baseline but suspect ATN given prolonged
   ischemia and now elevated Cr in the setting of rhabdomylosis and
   myoglobin load.
   - continue to monitor urine output and trend Cr
 continuing to rise
   - continue isotonic fluids for renal protection against myoglobinuria
   ##. Shock Liver: patient initially presenting with transaminitis likely
   representing shock liver from prolonged ischemia
   - continue trend LFT's and coags
   # RUE edema: likely [**1-20**] prolonged down time, limb not tense with
   palpable pulses and WWP digits
   - consider RUEx US to r/o DVT

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after being found in cardiac arrest following a heroin overdose. He was resuscitated and underwent a cooling protocol due to concerns for acute ischemia and infarction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
* He has a burst suppression background on EEG with intermittent spikes, and is being loaded with dilantin.
* He has mild metabolic acidosis, and is receiving hypertonic saline for cerebral edema.
* He has a mild elevation in lactate levels, and is being monitored for possible sepsis.
* He has a mild elevation in creatinine, and is being monitored for possible acute kidney injury.
* He has a mild elevation in liver enzymes, and is being monitored for possible liver injury.
* He has a possible aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* He has a possible rhabdomyolysis, and is being monitored for possible acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further neurological deterioration due to ongoing ischemia and infarction.
* Development of sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
* Progression of acute kidney injury to acute renal failure.
* Development of liver failure or acute liver injury.
* Prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure.
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's cerebral edema with hypertonic saline and consider IV mannitol if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
* Consider performing a CT or MRI scan to further evaluate the patient's brain injury.
* Consider performing a pulmonary artery catheterization to further evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.
* Consider performing a echocardiogram to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
* Consider performing a ultrasound to further evaluate the patient's abdominal organs."

   -renal recs: likely ATN c/b rhabdo- will spin urine sediment; hold off
   on repleting calcium; if cerebral edema can handle, consider some IVF
   to increase renal flow, but since CK decreasing and pt likely has ATN,
   not an absolute priority;  no urgent need for HD today; check urine
   lytes; hold all nephrotoxins; dose meds for creatinine clearance of 10-
   consider changing unasyn to Q24 dosing (done) and consider changing
   Keppra from 2grams [**Hospital1 7**] to 1gram Q24 (checked with neuro, they want it
   at 1.5grams Q24)
   -Dilantin level goal is 15-20 (11.7 this AM). Increased dose to 150mg
   TID and gave extra 100mg around noon. Checking level before PM dose as
   well.
   -Receiving hypertonic saline for increased ICP. Neuro said they would
   prefer repeat head imaging before starting mannitol. If we want to
   start mannitol, they will give us the dosages, but we will also have to
   consult neurosurg to place ICP monitor
   -Head MRI to evaluate for continued/worsening cerebral edema and also
   for prognostic implications
   -RUE swelling- called Plastics, who were not concerned for compartment
   syndrome given good pulses/cap refill. Final recs-->wrap with ACE,
   elevate arm, consider moving IV sites
   -ordered RUE U/S
   1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity
   although the internal jugular vein on the right is not assessed due to
   overlying dressing.
   2. There is thrombosis of the right cephalic vein which is a
   superficial vein.
   3. Velocities in the left subclavian vein are noted to be higher than
   on the right, of uncertain significance. Variation is demonstrated in
   the venous waveforms of the right upper extremity; however, more
   central thrombosis is not completely excluded.
   -A line finicky--> replaced over wire
   -weaned sedation for better neuro exam
   -serum osms still not at goal with hypertonic saline
   -pt noted to be posturing; repeat CT showed increased cerebral and
   cerebellar edema. d/w neurosurg- no intervention and would not place a
   bolt b/c not a surgical candidate anyway. Called family.

   MRI head - Extensive abnormalities, with restricted diffusion in the
   caudate and basal
   ganglia as seen on prior CT; also restricted diffusion in the parieto-
   occipital lobes bilaterally; c/w infarcts. Parieto-occipital
   abnormalities
   likely more acute, given relatively little FLAIR signal in these areas.
   Increased FLAIR signal in the cerebellum bilaterally likely related to
   edema. Difficult to compare degree of edema to the prior CT; refer to
   CT obtained at 2100 hours.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 23-year-old male who suffered cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose and was resuscitated. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, seizure activity, and hyperosmolality. He has been receiving hypertonic saline to manage his cerebral edema and has had several imaging studies, including a CT head and MRI, which showed extensive abnormalities consistent with infarcts and edema.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with increasing cerebral edema, seizures, and oliguria/anuria. His renal function has been declining, and he has been treated with diuretics and hypertonic saline to manage his edema. His electrolytes have been monitored, and he has been receiving nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's cerebral edema is worsening, which may lead to further deterioration in his mental status and potentially life-threatening complications such as herniation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to continue, and he may require dialysis in the future.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis is ongoing, which may lead to further muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications such as compartment syndrome.
4. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity is ongoing, which may lead to further neurological damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperosmolality: The patient's hyperosmolality is a concern, as it may lead to further complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's coarse breathing sounds and bilateral patchy infiltrates on his chest X-ray suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, which may lead to further respiratory complications.
7. UTI: The patient's urine culture is pending, and he has been treated with antibiotics for a possible UTI.
8. Shock liver: The patient's transaminitis is likely due to shock liver from prolonged ischemia, which may lead to further liver damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

   Imaging: CT head -Diffusely increased cerebral edema since [**9-11**] exam,
   with further sulcal effacement and slight decrease in size of
   ventricles. No evidence of
   herniation at this time. No ICH .
   MRI head - Extensive abnormalities, with restricted diffusion in the
   caudate and basal
   ganglia as seen on prior CT; also restricted diffusion in the parieto-
   occipital lobes bilaterally; c/w infarcts. Parieto-occipital
   abnormalities
   likely more acute, given relatively little FLAIR signal in these areas.
   Increased FLAIR signal in the cerebellum bilaterally likely related to
   edema. Difficult to compare degree of edema to the prior CT; refer to
   CT obtained at 2100 hours.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   23 yom s/p cadiac arrest via heroin overdose.
   #. S/p cardiac arrest:
   -patient is now s/p cooling protocol
   -CE trending down
   #. Cerebral Edema: CT head concerning for BG and IC ischemia and
   seizure activity demonstrated by EEG. New posturing yesterday.
   Increased edema on imaging.
   - gradually wean sedation for more thorough neurological evaluation
   - continue dilantin and keppra per neurology for ongoing seizure
   activity; both redosed as per renal/neuro recs
   -hypertonic saline to keep osm 320. Not candidate for ICP monitor as
   per neurosurg. Neuro unable to give prognosis, family aware that
   prognosis is likely grave.
   ##. Possible Aspiration PNA: patient intially noted to have coarse BS
   with initial CXR demonstrating bilateral patchy infiltrates; febrile
   last night to 100.8
   - continue Unasyn
   - f/u cultures and CXR
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: patient with unknown baseline but suspect ATN given prolonged
   ischemia and now elevated Cr in the setting of rhabdomylosis and
   myoglobin load.
   - continue to monitor urine output and trend Cr
 continuing to rise
   - As per renal, likely ATN c/b rhabdo- will spin urine sediment; hold
   off on repleting calcium; if cerebral edema can handle, consider some
   IVF to increase renal flow, but since CK decreasing and pt likely has
   ATN, not an absolute priority;  no urgent need for HD as of yet
   -hold all nephrotoxins; dose meds for creatinine clearance of 10- have
   to check daily if need to redose unasyn and keppra
   ##. Shock Liver: patient initially presenting with transaminitis likely
   representing shock liver from prolonged ischemia
   - continue trend LFT's and coags (trending down)
   # RUE edema: likely [**1-20**] prolonged down time, no evidence of compartment
   syndrome on exam
    -seen by plastics, who did not think there was concern for CS and did
   not do compartment pressures
   - RUE u/s showed no DVT, only superficial
   -elevate arm, ACE bandages

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   consider changing unasyn to Q24 dosing (done) and consider changing
   Keppra from 2grams [**Hospital1 7**] to 1gram Q24 (checked with neuro, they want it
   at 1.5grams Q24)
   -Dilantin level goal is 15-20 (11.7 this AM). Increased dose to 150mg
   TID and gave extra 100mg around noon. Checking level before PM dose as
   well.
   -Receiving hypertonic saline for increased ICP. Neuro said they would
   prefer repeat head imaging before starting mannitol. If we want to
   start mannitol, they will give us the dosages, but we will also have to
   consult neurosurg to place ICP monitor
   -Head MRI to evaluate for continued/worsening cerebral edema and also
   for prognostic implications
   -RUE swelling- called Plastics, who were not concerned for compartment
   syndrome given good pulses/cap refill. Final recs-->wrap with ACE,
   elevate arm, consider moving IV sites
   -ordered RUE U/S
   1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity
   although the internal jugular vein on the right is not assessed due to

   2. There is thrombosis of the right cephalic vein which is a
   superficial vein.
   3. Velocities in the left subclavian vein are noted to be higher than
   on the right, of uncertain significance. Variation is demonstrated in
   the venous waveforms of the right upper extremity; however, more
   central thrombosis is not completely excluded.

   Imaging: CT head -Diffusely increased cerebral edema since [**9-11**] exam,
   with further sulcal effacement and slight decrease in size of
   ventricles. No evidence of
   herniation at this time. No ICH .
   MRI head - Extensive abnormalities, with restricted diffusion in the
   caudate and basal
   ganglia as seen on prior CT; also restricted diffusion in the parieto-
   occipital lobes bilaterally; c/w infarcts. Parieto-occipital
   abnormalities
   likely more acute, given relatively little FLAIR signal in these areas.
   Increased FLAIR signal in the cerebellum bilaterally likely related to
   edema. Difficult to compare degree of edema to the prior CT; refer to
   CT obtained at 2100 hours.

   23 yom s/p cadiac arrest via heroin overdose.
   #. S/p cardiac arrest:
   -patient is now s/p cooling protocol
   -CE trending down
   #. Cerebral Edema: CT head concerning for BG and IC ischemia and
   seizure activity demonstrated by EEG. New posturing yesterday.
   Increased edema on imaging.
   - gradually wean sedation for more thorough neurological evaluation
   - continue dilantin and keppra per neurology for ongoing seizure
   activity; both redosed as per renal/neuro recs
   -hypertonic saline to keep osm 320. Not candidate for ICP monitor as
   per neurosurg. Neuro unable to give prognosis, family aware that
   prognosis is likely grave.
   ##. Possible Aspiration PNA: patient intially noted to have coarse BS
   with initial CXR demonstrating bilateral patchy infiltrates; febrile
   last night to 100.8
   - continue Unasyn
   - f/u cultures and CXR
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: patient with unknown baseline but suspect ATN given prolonged
   ischemia and now elevated Cr in the setting of rhabdomylosis and
   myoglobin load.
   - continue to monitor urine output and trend Cr
 continuing to rise
   - As per renal, likely ATN c/b rhabdo- will spin urine sediment; hold
   off on repleting calcium; if cerebral edema can handle, consider some
   IVF to increase renal flow, but since CK decreasing and pt likely has
   ATN, not an absolute priority;  no urgent need for HD as of yet
   -hold all nephrotoxins; dose meds for creatinine clearance of 10- have
   to check daily if need to redose unasyn and keppra
   ##. Shock Liver: patient initially presenting with transaminitis likely
   representing shock liver from prolonged ischemia
   - continue trend LFT's and coags (trending down)
   # RUE edema: likely [**1-20**] prolonged down time, no evidence of compartment
   syndrome on exam
    -seen by plastics, who did not think there was concern for CS and did

Summary:

The patient is a 23-year-old male who suffered cardiac arrest due to heroin overdose and was resuscitated. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, seizure activity, and hyperosmolar state. He also has oliguria/anuria, anoxic brain damage, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is likely grave.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's creatinine clearance is decreasing, and his urine output is decreasing, which may indicate ATN.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are increasing, which may lead to further muscle damage and potential cardiac complications.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient is being treated with Dilantin and Keppra for ongoing seizure activity, and his EEG shows seizure activity.
4. Hyperosmolar State: The patient's osm level is 320, which may lead to further neurological damage and potential cardiac complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his oxygenation status is compromised.
6. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's cerebral edema is increasing, and his brain is likely experiencing ischemia, which may lead to permanent brain damage.
7. Shock Liver: The patient's LFTs are trending down, which may indicate shock liver.
8. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's right upper extremity edema is concerning for potential compartment syndrome.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, but the internal jugular vein on the right is not assessed due to overlying dressing.
10. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows 1+ GNR, and his blood cultures are pending. He is at risk for developing sepsis and potential multi-organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and trend his creatinine clearance.
2. Continue to treat the patient's seizure activity with Dilantin and Keppra.
3. Monitor the patient's hyperosmolar state and consider administering IVF to increase renal flow.
4. Continue to trend the patient's LFTs and coags.
5. Elevate the patient's right upper extremity to reduce the risk of compartment syndrome.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider adjusting his ventilator settings.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider adjusting his sedation regimen.
8. Consider consulting with neurosurgery to place an ICP monitor and to discuss potential interventions for the patient's cerebral edema.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and consider adjusting his antibiotic regimen.
10. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to discuss potential interventions for the patient's acute renal failure."
