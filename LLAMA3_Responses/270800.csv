Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Ischemic Heart Disease. They have been on invasive hemodynamic monitoring and have received multiple infusions, including heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/54 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 181 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's diagnosis of CAD and Ischemic Heart Disease puts them at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and cardiac failure.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient's use of heparin sodium, an anticoagulant, increases their risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage and hematoma.
3. Infection Complications: The patient's immuno-compromised state due to their critical illness and use of invasive lines and devices increases their risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
4. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to eat due to their critical illness may lead to malnutrition, which can further compromise their immune function and increase their risk of infection.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of invasive respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation, increases their risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) and respiratory failure.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's use of diuretics and other medications may increase their risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's critical illness and use of sedatives and paralytics may increase their risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and neurocognitive dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3431**] is a 62 YOM with coronary artery disease status post bare
   metal stent to left circumflex who presented for elective
   catheterization secondary to exertional angina and positive stress
   Sestamibi, who was found to have significant left main disease and is
   status post balloon pump while awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known coronary artery disease with previous bare metal
   stent.  Now found to have significant disease throughout the left main,
   LAD, and right coronary artery.  The patient is at significant risk for
   ischemia and would benefit from CABG.  Because of severity of coronary
   artery disease he had placement of balloon pump necessitating ICU
   monitoring.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   -- Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] (will hold if HR < 55)
   -- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
   -- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2386**] (consented)
   -- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
   -- NPO at MN
   -- Will need PT consult after CABG
   -- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not
   because of decreased EF, but because degree of stenosis and goal of
   increased coronary perfusing pressure
   .
   # PUMP:  Evidence of moderate RV dilation and hypokinesis and regional
   left ventricular systolic dyfunction but preserved EF.
   -- On balloon pump as above
   -- Will need to start [**Last Name (un) 284**] (allergy to ACEi)
   -- Continue metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is in NSR with rates in the low 60s, high 50s.  No
   evidence of AV delay or heart block
   -- continue to monitor on telemetry
   -- Replete lytes PRN
   -- Will give metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], but hold if HR < 55
   .
   #  HYPERTENSION: BP in the 140s.  Pt thinks he is supposed to take 100
   mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, this was recently changed to half this dose
   ([**2182-4-22**])
   -- as above continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- Continue simvastatin
   .
   #  GLUCOSE INTOLLERANCE:
   -- FS QID
   -- Insulin SS
   .
   #  DEPRESSION:
   -- Continue Lexapro
   -- SW consult for coping
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3431**] is a 62 YOM with coronary artery disease status post bare
   metal stent to left circumflex who presented for elective
   catheterization secondary to exertional angina and positive stress
   Sestamibi, who was found to have significant left main disease and is
   status post balloon pump while awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known coronary artery disease with previous bare metal
   stent.  Now found to have significant disease throughout the left main,
   LAD, and right coronary artery.  The patient is at significant risk for
   ischemia and would benefit from CABG.  Because of severity of coronary
   artery disease he had placement of balloon pump necessitating ICU
   monitoring.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   -- Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] (will hold if HR < 55)
   -- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
   -- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2386**] (consented)
   -- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
   -- NPO at MN
   -- Will need PT consult after CABG
   -- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not
   because of decreased EF, but because degree of stenosis and goal of
   increased coronary perfusing pressure
   .
   # PUMP:  Evidence of moderate RV dilation and hypokinesis and regional
   left ventricular systolic dyfunction but preserved EF.
   -- On balloon pump as above
   -- Will need to start [**Last Name (un) 284**] (allergy to ACEi)
   -- Continue metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is in NSR with rates in the low 60s, high 50s.  No
   evidence of AV delay or heart block
   -- continue to monitor on telemetry
   -- Replete lytes PRN
   -- Will give metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], but hold if HR < 55
   .
   #  HYPERTENSION: BP in the 140s.  Pt thinks he is supposed to take 100
   mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, this was recently changed to half this dose
   ([**2182-4-22**])
   -- as above continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- Continue simvastatin
   .
   #  GLUCOSE INTOLLERANCE:
   -- FS QID
   -- Insulin SS
   .
   #  DEPRESSION:
   -- Continue Lexapro
   -- SW consult for coping
   .
   FEN:  Cardiac heart healthy diet, NPO for procedure at MN

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post bare metal stent to the left circumflex artery. He presented for elective catheterization due to exertional angina and positive stress Sestamibi, which revealed significant left main disease. He was placed on a balloon pump while awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with the following vital signs:

* Temperature: 98.4Â°F (37Â°C)
* Heart rate: 51 bpm (49-64 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 131/54 mmHg (95-120/89-120 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (14-22 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient has the following medical conditions:

* Coronary artery disease
* Significant left main disease
* Right coronary artery disease
* Ischemia
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Glucose intolerance
* Depression

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium
* Metoprolol
* Aspirin
* Simvastatin
* Lexapro

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 40.4%
* Platelet count: 181 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 14.8 g/dL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 26 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right dorsal pedal pulse not assessed, left dorsal pedal pulse not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli not assessed, movement not assessed, tone not assessed

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Ischemia due to coronary artery disease
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Glucose intolerance
* Depression
* Complications related to balloon pump placement
* Complications related to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

Based on the patient's condition and treatment plan, the following potential medical complications should be closely monitored:
