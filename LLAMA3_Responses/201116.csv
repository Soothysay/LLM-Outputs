   Microbiology: Blood culture [**7-3**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and
   coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.  Unclear source at
   this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how to interpret the
   elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of hepatic failure.
   No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may be cardiogenic
   given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac enzymes,
   consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is also on
   the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor

   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .

   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy suggest the possibility of septic shock. The source of the infection is unclear, and the patient's underlying hepatic failure and ESRD may contribute to the severity of the condition.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's junctional bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, possibly due to an inferior MI.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's HCT drop and dry appearance on exam suggest the possibility of hypovolemic shock, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying ESRD.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with an admission ABG of 7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 of 100%. The patient's ongoing respiratory support and monitoring are necessary.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen suggest a coagulopathy, which may be secondary to sepsis or underlying hepatic failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's HCT drop and history of UGIB suggest the possibility of anemia, which may require transfusion.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia, likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure, requires ongoing monitoring and management.
8. Junctional Bradycardia: The patient's junctional bradyarrhythmia requires ongoing monitoring and management, and the patient's underlying cardiac condition, including the possibility of an inferior MI, needs to be considered.

The patient's underlying medical conditions, including ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and afib/aflutter, may contribute to the complexity of their condition. The patient's medical team should continue to closely monitor their condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Would favor holding off on antibiotics an evaluating her status, as I
   am not sure this is sepsis.  If she decompensates, can cover broadly
   with vanc/zosyn, as she is often hospitalized, however there is no
   clear fever source at this time.
   -Follow up cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Microbiology: Blood culture [**7-3**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -active type and cross

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 72 yr old woman with ESRD, severe right sided
   heart failure and congestive hepatopathy,
   found hypotensive and bradycardic at NH, intubated and transferred with
   pressor requiring shock.
   Overnight events:

   Meds : ASA, chlorhex, Norepi, Famotidine, Keppra,
   Plan: As per housestaff notes but would add
   Hypotension: etiology still unclear whether primary cardiac event with
   hypotensive bradycardic arrest versus sepsis that led to cardiac
   compromise.
        In terms of sepsis: will Rx with Vanco, Zosyn, follow up cultures
   - add on LFTs as she had rising bili at          discharge last time
   but common bile duct stable on admit CT, send stool culture
        Regarding cardiac event: Appreciate cardiology input, continue
   medical management
        Adrenal Insuuficiency: certainly a possibility with low K and
   chronic illness - check cortisol, give   empiric stress dose steroids.
   Resp Failure: due to poor mental status. Able to switch to PSV. Will
   SBT and potential for extubation this afternoon.
   Anemia: likely due to chronic GI blood loss, responded to transfusion
   Renal: alert team - possible HD tommorow
   Access: right groin line
 will try to for PIVs
   Social: try for family meeting today/tomorrow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 72 yr old woman with ESRD, severe right sided
   heart failure and congestive hepatopathy,
   found hypotensive and bradycardic at NH, intubated and transferred with
   pressor requiring shock.

   Hypotension: etiology still unclear whether primary cardiac event with
   hypotensive bradycardic arrest versus sepsis that led to cardiac
   compromise.
        In terms of sepsis: will Rx with Vanco, Zosyn, follow up cultures
   - add on LFTs as she had rising bili at          discharge last time
   but common bile duct stable on admit CT, send stool culture
        Regarding cardiac event: Appreciate cardiology input, continue
   medical management
        Adrenal Insuuficiency: certainly a possibility with low K and
   chronic illness - check cortisol, give   empiric stress dose steroids.
   Resp Failure: due to poor mental status. Able to switch to PSV. Will
   SBT and potential for extubation this afternoon.
   Anemia: likely due to chronic GI blood loss, responded to transfusion

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued hypotension and bradycardia may lead to further cardiac compromise, including decreased cardiac output and potential for cardiac arrest.
	* The patient's cardiac enzymes are rising, indicating ongoing myocardial damage, which may lead to cardiac failure and further complications.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
	* The need for mechanical ventilation and the patient's underlying respiratory disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of seizures, stroke, or other neurological complications.
	* The patient's hypoglycemia and hypokalemia may contribute to neurological symptoms.
4. Infectious complications:
	* The patient's coagulopathy and elevated lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure.
	* The patient's antibiotic coverage is inadequate, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* The patient's chronic gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to anemia, hypovolemia, and further complications.
	* The patient's underlying liver disease may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Renal complications:
	* The patient's underlying kidney disease may worsen, leading to further complications, including acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
	* The patient's increased lactate levels may indicate underlying kidney dysfunction.
7. Hematological complications:
	* The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications.
	* The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications, including hypovolemia and organ failure.
8. Endocrine complications:
	* The patient's adrenal insufficiency may worsen, leading to further complications, including hypotension, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
	* The patient's hypokalemia may worsen, leading to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and provide optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and
   afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive today at her NH,
   with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia,
   elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   .
   #. Hypotension: In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated
   lactate, and coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.
   Unclear source at this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how
   to interpret the elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of
   hepatic failure.  No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may
   be cardiogenic given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac
   enzymes, consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is
   also on the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated cardiac enzymes: In the setting of junctional
   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   .
   #. Anemia: baseline HCT 27-29, now 21.  In the setting of a history of
   UGIB
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -Type and cross and transfuse one  units
   -recheck HCT after transfusion
   .
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -Will alert neprhology of the admission
   .
   #. Seizure disorder
   -Continue home keppra

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's condition is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach to manage. The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy are consistent with septic shock. The source of the sepsis is unclear, and the patient's underlying conditions, including ESRD and congestive hepatopathy, may contribute to the development of septic shock.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's junctional bradyarrhythmia and elevated cardiac enzymes are consistent with a possible inferior MI, which could lead to cardiogenic shock.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's HCT drop and dry appearance on exam suggest that hypovolemic shock may also be a consideration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and the ABG results suggest that she may be over-ventilated. This could lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen suggest a coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's HCT drop and history of UGIB suggest that anemia may be a concern.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder and hypoglycemia may increase the risk of seizure activity.
8. ESRD: The patient's underlying ESRD may require specific management and monitoring to prevent complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Management of septic shock: The patient will be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care, including fluids and vasopressors as needed.
2. Cardiac management: The patient will be monitored for cardiac enzymes and arrhythmias, and may require anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
3. Respiratory management: The patient will continue to be mechanically ventilated, and the ventilator settings will be adjusted as needed to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Coagulopathy management: The patient will be monitored for signs of bleeding and will receive supportive care, including transfusions if necessary.
5. Anemia management: The patient will receive transfusions as needed to manage anemia.
6. Seizure disorder management: The patient will continue to receive seizure medications and will be monitored for signs of seizure activity.
7. ESRD management: The patient will continue to receive hemodialysis as scheduled, and will be monitored for any complications related to ESRD.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and optimize outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is a concern about weaning sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as possible. If not managed properly, respiratory failure can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, lung injury, or even death.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and flutter, and is currently experiencing a junctional bradycardic rhythm, which may be secondary to an inferior myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of coagulopathy and hypotension raises concerns about potential cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient has a large left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, which may be a sign of an underlying infection. The patient is being empirically covered with vancomycin and zosyn, and follow-up cultures are planned. If not managed properly, infection can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient has a history of congestive hepatopathy and hepatic failure, which may be exacerbating her coagulopathy and hypoglycemia. If not managed properly, hepatic failure can lead to further complications such as encephalopathy, bleeding, or death.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and her hemoglobin level is still low despite receiving one unit of packed red blood cells. If not managed properly, anemia can lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, or even cardiac complications.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is being continued on home keppra. If not managed properly, seizure disorder can lead to further complications such as seizure activity, brain injury, or even death.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated PT, PTT, and INR, which may be secondary to hepatic failure. If not managed properly, coagulopathy can lead to further complications such as bleeding, organ failure, or death.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team. This includes frequent vital sign checks, laboratory monitoring, and adjustments to her medications and treatments as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to an inferior myocardial infarction, and the presence of a junctional rhythm raises suspicion for this diagnosis. However, the elevated lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may be secondary to an infectious cause, but the elevated lactate and coagulopathy suggest that this is unlikely.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to hepatic failure, and FDP testing was negative, ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Rhythm abnormalities: The patient's initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, which may be secondary to digoxin toxicity or an inferior myocardial infarction.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure, and is being treated with D10 gtt.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to chronic kidney disease and is being managed with transfusions.
7. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and will require continued management.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and the family has requested that no tubes or lines be inserted. The patient is being managed with non-invasive cuff pressures and will be treated with empiric antibiotics for potential infection. The patient's rhythm is being monitored, and digoxin and amiodarone have been discontinued. The patient's hypoglycemia is being managed with D10 gtt, and the anemia is being managed with transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's coagulopathy and elevated lactate suggest that they may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's rhythm abnormalities may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's underlying hepatic failure may worsen, leading to further coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's hypothermia and coagulopathy suggest that they may be at risk for infection, particularly with gram-negative bacteria.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 24-hour-old ICU admission, had a difficult night with hypotension, requiring Levophed and Neosynephrine support. The patient was extubated with no difficulties and Neosynephrine was weaned off. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a significant concern, especially with the recent weaning off Neosynephrine. Close monitoring of blood pressures and prompt intervention if hypotension recurs is essential.
2. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of infection given the patient's immunocompromised state. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
3. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory compromise due to the patient's underlying condition and potential for further deterioration.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential for further cardiovascular compromise due to hypotension and infection require close monitoring and prompt intervention if necessary.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as stress ulcer and bleeding, is high due to the patient's critical illness and potential for further deterioration.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional needs are not being met, and there is a risk of malnutrition and further compromise of the patient's condition.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated PT and PTT, indicating a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of coagulation studies and prompt intervention if necessary is essential to prevent bleeding complications.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine, indicating potential renal compromise. Close monitoring of renal function and prompt intervention if necessary is essential to prevent further deterioration.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an electrolyte imbalance, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and prompt intervention if necessary is essential to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, who was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was extubated without difficulty. She has been diagnosed with a possible inferior MI, and is being treated with Levophed to maintain a MAP of >65. She has a coagulopathy, which is likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure, and is being treated with empiric antibiotics. She has also been diagnosed with hypoglycemia, anemia, and a possible seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Inferior MI: The patient's hypotension and junctional bradycardic rhythm raise suspicion for an inferior MI. If this diagnosis is confirmed, the patient may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure, may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia, secondary to underlying hepatic failure, may increase her risk of further hypoglycemic episodes, which can lead to neurological damage or even death.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely secondary to chronic bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding, may increase her risk of further bleeding complications or anemia-related complications, such as fatigue or shortness of breath.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's possible seizure disorder may increase her risk of further seizures, which can lead to neurological damage or even death.
6. Infection: The patient's empiric antibiotics may not be effective in treating her underlying infection, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's underlying cardiac disease and medication use may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease and medication use may increase her risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.   AM
   cortisol in the thirties, so unlikely adrenal insufficiency.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated, but was extubated today with no difficulties. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been weaned off norepinephrine. She has a code status of DNR/DNI and does not want escalation of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to underlying conditions such as MI, sepsis, or cardiac failure. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further drops in blood pressure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure, but it may also be related to DIC or other underlying conditions. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Rhythm Abnormalities: The patient's initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, which may be related to digoxin toxicity or MI. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further rhythm abnormalities.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia is likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to underlying ESRD and chronic blood loss. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further anemia.
6. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and further management is necessary to prevent further seizures.
7. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications related to ESRD.
8. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk for infectious complications due to her underlying conditions and the fact that she is in the ICU. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat any potential infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home (NH) with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.2°C, HR = 80 bpm, BP = 90/45 mmHg, RR = 9 breaths/min, SpO2 = 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min
* Fluid balance: Total in 1,810 mL, total out 518 mL, with a balance of 1,810 mL
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation
* Laboratory results: Elevated troponin and lactate, mild coagulopathy, and chronic anemia
* Imaging: No imaging studies mentioned in the note

The patient's goals of care are to prioritize comfort and minimize painful procedures, with no new lines, no escalation of care, and a DNR/DNI status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and elevated lactate levels
* Cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest due to the patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter and mild troponin leak
* Fulminant hepatic failure leading to worsening coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding
* Hypoglycemic seizures or coma due to the patient's chronic hypoglycemia and elevated lactate levels
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic anemia and potential underlying lung disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's coagulopathy and potential underlying gastrointestinal disease
* Infection or sepsis related to the patient's central venous catheter or urinary catheter
* Renal failure or worsening ESRD due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic medications

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and adjust her care accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- Contineu to cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion
   for infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, would advance diet as tolerated

Based on the patient's progress note, the following key points can be summarized:

* The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, who was found unresponsive at her nursing home with hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
* The patient has a junctional bradycardic rhythm, which is being monitored on telemetry.
* The patient has a mild troponin leak, which is unlikely to represent a new event leading to cardiogenic shock.
* The patient is being treated with norepinephrine for hypotension and has a right femoral line in place.
* The patient has a coagulopathy, which is worsening, and is being empirically covered with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
* The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is being continued on home keppra.
* The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is being treated with comfort care, with a focus on minimizing painful procedures.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis, given the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of a central line
* Cardiogenic shock, given the patient's mild troponin leak and history of cardiac arrhythmias
* Hepatic encephalopathy, given the patient's worsening coagulopathy and history of liver disease
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and need for mechanical ventilation
* Renal failure, given the patient's history of ESRD and need for dialysis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, given the patient's history of liver disease and use of anticoagulation therapy
* Infection, given the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and drains."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a 24-hour event summary. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/45 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, and they are receiving no respiratory support. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,810 mL and 518 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, and therefore, many assessments were not performed. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating potential cardiac injury. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and their hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are decreased.

The patient's medication regimen includes antibiotics, antihypertensive medications, and medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK/CKMB levels suggest potential cardiac injury, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and elevated respiratory rate may indicate impending respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest or the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending blood culture results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and increased mortality.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's decreased platelet count and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate impending renal failure, which could lead to increased mortality and morbidity.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's limited physical examination and lack of neurological assessments make it difficult to assess their neurological status, which may be at risk due to their critical condition.
7. DVT and pulmonary embolism: The patient's prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may not be sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism, which could lead to significant morbidity and mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and the decision was made to begin comfort measures. The patient is currently receiving pain management with IV Dilaudid at low doses and is not being escalated to higher levels of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's underlying condition and the presence of hypothermia, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG values is essential.
2. Sepsis: Although there is no clear source of infection, the patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels may indicate a potential septic episode. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's mild troponin leak and bradycardic rhythm may indicate a risk of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic parameters is essential.
4. Cerebral edema: Given the patient's hypotension and bradycardia, there is a risk of cerebral edema. Monitoring of neurological status and imaging studies may be necessary to assess for this complication.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of ESRD may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of stool and NG tube output is essential.
6. Infection: The patient's coagulopathy and immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any potential infections.
7. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and history of renal failure may increase the risk of further renal decline. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte values is essential.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and detect potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 68/36 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 8 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.2
* Hematocrit: 30.6
* Platelet count: [not specified]
* Creatinine: 2.2
* Troponin-T: 1.13
* Total CO2: 22
* Glucose: [not specified]

The patient's medical conditions include:

* ESRD on hemodialysis (MWF)
* Congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure
* Afib/aflutter on digoxin
* Seizure disorder (on home keppra)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Comfort and minimizing painful procedures
* No new lines or escalation of care
* DNR/DNI status
* Pain control with PRN IV morphine
* Daily full-strength aspirin
* Levophed for hypotension, to be weaned
* Right femoral line in place
* Discontinuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to low suspicion for infection
* F/u cultures
* Monitoring for AMS, coagulopathy, and rhythm abnormalities
* Treatment for shock, hypoglycemia, anemia, and ESRD

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock due to the patient's history of afib/aflutter and mild troponin leak
* Fulminant hepatic failure exacerbating coagulopathy and worsening liver function
* Hypoglycemic seizures due to chronic hypoglycemia
* Anemia and potential need for transfusions
* ESRD worsening uremia and electrolyte imbalances
* Seizure disorder exacerbation due to withdrawal from keppra or other medications
* Infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and potential presence of indwelling lines and catheters
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and potential need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity and potential need for cardioversion or anti-arrhythmic medications"

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of sepsis, shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 68/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output. The patient's fluid balance is 996 mL over the past 24 hours, with a net input of 86 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 188 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 40 U/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medication list includes morphine for pain management, and the patient is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may continue to worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver injury or failure, which could lead to coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other electrolyte-related complications.
5. Bloodstream infection: The patient's IV lines may be at risk for bloodstream infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Vascular complications: The patient's multi-lumen IV line may be at risk for vascular complications, such as thrombosis or bleeding.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure or respiratory distress.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's lack of movement and tone assessment may indicate neurological complications, such as brain injury or stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Goals of Care: Family meeting held yesterday, with emphasis on
   comfort and minimizing painful procedures
   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   n        Pain control with PRN IV Morphine
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- D/C vanc/zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   -- F/U cultures
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.
   #. Seizure disorder
   -- Continue home keppra

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a history of ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving comfort care with a focus on minimizing painful procedures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 68/36 mmHg. The patient is receiving morphine PRN for pain control and has a right femoral line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Although there is no clear source of infection at this time, the patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to rule out sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's troponin leak is mild, but the patient's hypotension and bradycardia may indicate the presence of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and laboratory results is necessary to rule out cardiogenic shock.
3. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's worsening INR and elevated bilirubin levels suggest the presence of fulminant hepatic failure. Close monitoring of the patient's liver function and laboratory results is necessary to rule out fulminant hepatic failure.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's chronic hypoglycemia is a concern, particularly in the setting of underlying hepatic failure. Close monitoring of the patient's blood glucose levels and administration of D10 drip as necessary is necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's worsening INR and elevated partial thromboplastin time suggest the presence of coagulopathy. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and administration of anticoagulation therapy as necessary is necessary to prevent bleeding.
6. Rhythm Abnormalities: The patient's initial presenting rhythm was junctional bradycardia, which may have been caused by digoxin toxicity or IMI. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and administration of antiarrhythmic therapy as necessary is necessary to prevent rhythm abnormalities.
7. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia is a concern, particularly in the setting of underlying ESRD. Close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels and administration of transfusions as necessary is necessary to prevent anemia.
8. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is a concern, particularly in the setting of underlying liver failure. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and administration of dialysis as necessary is necessary to prevent ESRD.
9. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder is a concern, particularly in the setting of underlying liver failure. Close monitoring of the patient's seizure activity and administration of anticonvulsant therapy as necessary is necessary to prevent seizures.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential medical complications."
