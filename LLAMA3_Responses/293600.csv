   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and
   ciprofloxacin admitted from clinic with fevers, rigors, and
   questionable worsening back pain.
   .
   # Infection: Pt with fevers/rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension on
   admission with no obvious infectious source.  Overnight, CVL was
   maintained >8, SvO2 was 78%, and patient was normotensive after
   receiving 4L IVF.  Per ID, patient was started on meropenem,
   vancomycin, and azithromycin in addition to home voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acylovir.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and ciprofloxacin, and currently admitted for fevers, rigors, and worsening back pain.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Fever and rigors
* Hypoxia (SpO2: 93%)
* Tachycardia (HR: 93 bpm)
* Hypotension (BP: 130/67 mmHg)
* Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen therapy
* Bibasilar rales on pulmonary examination
* 2+ edema in both lower and upper extremities
* Worsening back pain

Laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 10.7 K/uL
* Hct: 25.7%
* Plt: 54 K/uL
* Cr: 1.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 23
* Glucose: 123 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Ca++: 7.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and azithromycin, as well as antifungal therapy with voriconazole. The patient is also receiving stress-dose steroids and cellcept.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying condition and the presence of fever and rigors
* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's hypoxia and bibasilar rales
* Worsening of chronic renal insufficiency due to the patient's elevated Cr levels
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications due to the patient's low platelet count
* Aspergillosis or other fungal infections due to the patient's underlying condition and the presence of fever and rigors
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's hypertension and hypotension
* Sarcoidosis or other autoimmune disorders due to the patient's underlying condition

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and
   ciprofloxacin admitted from clinic with fevers, rigors, and
   questionable worsening back pain.
   .
   # Infection: Pt with fevers/rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension on
   admission with no obvious infectious source.  Overnight, CVL was
   maintained >8, SvO2 was 78%, and patient was normotensive after
   receiving 4L IVF.  Per ID, patient was started on meropenem,
   vancomycin, and azithromycin in addition to home voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acylovir.  Uncertain source to infection at this time.
   Patient with past cellulitis, so this may represent deep
   infection/abscess that has not presented to date.  This may also be SBE
   given recurrent fevers from last admission or .  Finally, this may
   represent worsening of funal sinus infection.
   - Monitor fever curve and CBC
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, urinary Legionella, urinary
   Histoplasma, nasal viral screen
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin and meropenem
   - f/u ID recs
   - stress dose steroids
   - CT sinus
   - Hold of on MR spine for now.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient currently normotensive.  He is edematous this
   morning including upper extremities, but will hold off on resuming home
   lasix and observe patient for hemodynamic instability today.  Would
   consider diuresis tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Uncertain etiology at this point, although patient has known
   BOOP treated with steroids and cellcept.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept
   - Wean supplemental O2
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**] between
   1.4-1.8. Currently stable since last prior admission
   - Monitor creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to malignancy and currently at
   baseline.
   - Trend plt count.
   - Tranfuse for plt <10 or higher with signs of active bleeding.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission
   - f/u with oncology

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent cord transplant, is admitted to the ICU with fever, rigors, hypoxia, and worsening back pain. He has a past medical history of cellulitis, and his current infection is uncertain in source. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and azithromycin, in addition to home voriconazole, atovaquone, and acylovir.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 130/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (inspiration)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Central venous pressure: 14 mmHg

Laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 10.7 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 25.7%
* Platelet count: 54 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 123 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Normal appetite and mental status
* Head and neck: Normal
* Pulmonary: Bibasilar rales
* Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm
* Abdominal: Soft and non-tender
* Extremities: 2+ edema in both lower and upper extremities
* Skin: No erythema around the Hickman line site
* Musculoskeletal: No point tenderness along the spine
* Neurological: Alert and oriented

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, rigors, and hypoxia may indicate a severe infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of AML and recent cord transplant may increase the risk of DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and bibasilar rales may indicate pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate chronic kidney disease, which could worsen with nephrotoxic medications or inadequate fluid management.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, which could lead to life-threatening complications.
6. Aspergillosis: The patient's history of AML and recent cord transplant may increase the risk of aspergillosis, which could lead to invasive fungal infection.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and management, including:

* Continued broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Stress dose steroids
* Weaning of supplemental oxygen
* Monitoring of creatinine levels
* Avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Trending of platelet count
* Tranfusion for platelet count <10 or higher with signs of active bleeding
* Close monitoring of blood pressure
* Regular, replete as necessary

The patient's care will require a multidisciplinary approach, involving the ICU team, infectious disease specialists, oncologists, and other healthcare professionals."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and
   ciprofloxacin admitted from clinic with fevers, rigors, and
   questionable worsening back pain.
   .
   # Infection: Pt with fevers/rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension on
   admission with no obvious infectious source.  Overnight, CVL was
   maintained >8, SvO2 was 78%, and patient was normotensive after
   receiving 4L IVF.  Per ID, patient was started on meropenem,
   vancomycin, and azithromycin in addition to home voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acylovir.  Uncertain source to infection at this time.
   Patient with past cellulitis, so this may represent deep
   infection/abscess that has not presented to date.  This may also be SBE
   given recurrent fevers from last admission or line infection.  Finally,
   this may represent worsening of funal sinus infection.
   - Monitor fever curve and CBC
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures, urinary Legionella, urinary
   Histoplasma, nasal viral screen
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin and meropenem
   - f/u ID recs
   - stress dose steroids
   - CT sinus
   - Hold of on MR spine for now.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient currently normotensive.  He is edematous this
   morning including upper extremities, but will hold off on resuming home
   lasix and observe patient for hemodynamic instability today.  Would
   consider diuresis tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Uncertain etiology at this point, although patient has known
   BOOP treated with steroids and cellcept.
   - Continue steroids and cellcept
   - Wean supplemental O2
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**] between
   1.4-1.8. Currently stable since last prior admission
   - Monitor creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to malignancy and currently at
   baseline.
   - Trend plt count.
   - Tranfuse for plt <10 or higher with signs of active bleeding.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission
   - f/u with oncology
   .
   # BOOP: On chronic steroids and cellcept
   - stress dose steroids, continue cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis: Continue voriconazole
   .
   # HTN:
   - holding carvedilol given recent hemodynamic instability. Restart
   tomorrow if patient stable today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), recently admitted for cellulitis treated with clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. He is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with fever, rigors, hypoxia, and worsening back pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His physical examination reveals bibasilar rales on pulmonary examination, 2+ lower extremity edema, and no erythema around the left anterior Hickman site.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 54 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending.

The patient's infection is uncertain, and the treating physician is considering multiple possible sources, including deep infection/abscess, sepsis, and fungal sinus infection. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and azithromycin, and is also receiving antifungal therapy with voriconazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, rigors, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
2. Deep infection/abscess: The patient's worsening back pain and fever suggest the possibility of a deep infection or abscess, which can lead to serious complications if not promptly treated.
3. Fungal sinus infection: The patient's history of fungal sinus infection and the presence of bibasilar rales on pulmonary examination suggest the possibility of a fungal sinus infection, which can lead to serious complications if not promptly treated.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is uncertain in etiology, but it may be related to his known BOOP or other underlying conditions, which can lead to respiratory failure if not promptly treated.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine suggests chronic renal insufficiency, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely secondary to his malignancy and can lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal therapy, and stress dose steroids. The patient's family has been informed of the uncertain nature of his infection and the need for continued monitoring and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of hypotension. They have a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cord transplant, cellulitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and immunosuppression. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for sepsis, and their condition has improved. However, the source of the infection remains unknown, and the patient is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is improving, but they are still at risk for sepsis due to their underlying immunocompromised state and the lack of a clear source of infection.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has received recent antibiotics, which may have contributed to the development of C. difficile infection.
3. Line infection: The patient has a tunneled Hickman line, which may be a source of infection.
4. Recurrent cellulitis: The patient has a history of cellulitis, and they may be at risk for recurrent episodes.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen if they develop a secondary infection or sepsis.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase their risk of bleeding if they develop a secondary infection or sepsis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they may be at risk for respiratory failure if they develop a secondary infection or sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for any signs of sepsis or infection.
2. Consider obtaining additional imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to identify a potential source of infection.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen to better target potential pathogens.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust their fluid management accordingly to prevent worsening of their chronic renal failure.
5. Consider transfusing platelets to increase the patient's platelet count and reduce their risk of bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
   for AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.   Given
   temporary association with flushing catheter and development of
   respiratory distress, this likely represents transient SIRS in setting
   of systemic release of GNR.  Patient received amikacin x1 overnight in
   addition to meropenem, vancomycin, atovaquone, voriconazole, and
   acyclovir.
   - Continue double coverage for GNR pending final speciation and
   sensitivities. Patient received one dose of amikacin, discussed with ID
   and plan to cover with meropenem and tobramycin.
   - Remove Hickman, culture tip. Patient has PIV x2.
   - Continue with home atovaquone, voriconazole, and acylovir.  Hold
   empiric vancomycin.
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve, CBC
   - F/u cultures, urine Legionella and Histoplasma, serum galactomannan
   and beta-glucan
   - Per ID, will order TTE.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Respiratory status
   has since improved, although CXR demonstrates right-sided opacity
   predominantly in RLL.  Unclear at this time if this represents new
   pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug. CXR this AM
   appears to be improved compared to yesterday.
   - Continue double coverage of GNR, vancomycin as above
   - CXR tomorrow.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated creatinine since [**Month (only) 705**].
   Currently stable since last prior admission.  Unclear reason for his
   renal failure- per discharge summary from late [**Month (only) **] ?ATN with a
   renal ultrasound that was negative for hydro but no further workup
   performed.
   - Send urinalysis w/ sediment with urine lytes
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for gram-negative bacteremia (GNR) and transient acute respiratory distress. He has a Hickman line, which was recently flushed, and is receiving antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still has a fever and is at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and fever put him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's right-sided opacity on chest X-ray may represent new pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen with continued antibiotic therapy and potential nephrotoxicity.
5. Thrombocytopenia and anemia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia and anemia may worsen with continued bleeding and transfusion requirements.
6. Aspergillosis: The patient's aspergillosis may progress if not properly treated with voriconazole and other antifungal medications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen with continued use of antihypertensive medications and may require adjustment of his medication regimen.
8. Fever: The patient's fever may persist or worsen if not properly managed with antibiotics and antifungal medications.
9. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's Hickman line may be the source of his GNR bacteremia, and removal of the line is recommended to prevent further complications.
10. Thrombotic complications: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase his risk for thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
   for AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   removed overnight and patient now with PIVx2 and covered with
   amikacin and meropenem, in addition to vancomycin, atovaquone,
   voriconazole, and acyclovir.  Rigors and acute decompensation likely
   secondary to release of GNR into systemic vasculature during flushing
   of Hickman leading to transient SIRS.
   - Continue double coverage for GNR pending final speciation and
   sensitivities. Patient received one dose of amikacin, plan to continue.
   - Continue empiric coverage with vancomycin, continue with home
   atovaquone, voriconazole, and acylovir.
   - Follow-up with ID recs

   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Respiratory status
   has since improved, although CXR demonstrates right-sided opacity
   predominantly in RLL.  Unclear at this time if this represents new
   pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug. CXR this AM
   appears to be improved compared to yesterday.
   - Continue double coverage of GNR, vancomycin as above
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear reason for his renal
   failure- per discharge summary from late [**Month (only) **] ?ATN with a renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old gentleman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU for Gram-negative bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has been treated with amikacin, meropenem, vancomycin, atovaquone, voriconazole, and acyclovir.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia, likely secondary to the release of Gram-negative bacteria into the systemic vasculature during flushing of the Hickman line.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which are stable since his last admission.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 54, which is within his baseline levels, likely secondary to his malignancy.
5. Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, which is also likely secondary to his malignancy.
6. BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia): The patient is on chronic steroids and cellcept.
7. Aspergillosis: The patient is on voriconazole treatment.
8. HTN (Hypertension): The patient's antihypertensive medications have been held due to bacteremia and risk for hypotension/shock.
9. Sarcoid: The patient is not currently on treatment.
10. FEN (Fever, neutropenia, and elevated enzymes): The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now due to possible need for intubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's Gram-negative bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count put him at risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia can progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency can worsen if not managed properly.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulant therapy put him at risk for bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of invasive devices (Hickman line, central venous catheter) put him at risk for infection.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's BOOP and Aspergillosis can lead to organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
7. Shock: The patient's HTN and bacteremia put him at risk for shock.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
   for AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   removed overnight and patient now with PIVx2 and covered with
   amikacin and meropenem, in addition to vancomycin, atovaquone,
   voriconazole, and acyclovir.  Rigors and acute decompensation likely
   secondary to release of GNR into systemic vasculature during flushing
   of Hickman leading to transient SIRS.
   - Continue double coverage for GNR pending final speciation and
   sensitivities. Patient received one dose of amikacin, plan to continue.
   - Continue empiric coverage with vancomycin, continue with home
   atovaquone, voriconazole, and acylovir.
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve, CBC
   - F/u cultures, urine Legionella and Histoplasma, serum galactomannan
   and beta-glucan
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Respiratory status
   has since improved, although CXR demonstrates right-sided opacity
   predominantly in RLL.  Unclear at this time if this represents new
   pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug. CXR this AM
   appears to be improved compared to yesterday.
   - Continue double coverage of GNR, vancomycin as above
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear reason for his renal
   failure- per discharge summary from late [**Month (only) **] ?ATN with a renal
   ultrasound that was negative for hydro but no further workup performed.
   -send urinalysis w/ sediment
   - u/a and urine lytes
   -trend creatinine and renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Not acute. Currently within baseline levels. Likely
   secondary to malignancy
   - will follow
   - transfuse if less than 10 or for active bleeding
   .
   # ANEMIA: also secondary to malignancy, baseline hct between 26-33.
   -continue to trend hct and transfuse for hct < 25

   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN:
   - holding carvedilol and lisinopril given bacteremia and risk for
   hypotension / shock
   -can continue his aspirin 81mg daily
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has been readmitted to the ICU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has a Hickman line that was recently flushed, which likely led to the release of GNR bacteria into the systemic vasculature, causing transient SIRS.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient has improved from transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia, but still has mild respiratory distress and is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 10.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 54 x 10^9/L. The patient's lactate level is elevated at 1.3 mmol/L.
* Infection: The patient has GNR bacteremia and is receiving empiric coverage with vancomycin, amikacin, and meropenem.
* Renal function: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely secondary to his malignancy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to his malignancy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still mildly compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and is at risk of developing sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen due to the use of nephrotoxic medications or the progression of his underlying kidney disease.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing additional infections, particularly with Gram-negative bacteria.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: The patient is receiving empiric coverage with vancomycin, amikacin, and meropenem.
* Fluid management: The patient is receiving fluids to maintain adequate hydration.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy and may require further respiratory support if his condition deteriorates.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamic status will be closely monitored to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent hypotension.
* Renal function monitoring: The patient's renal function will be closely monitored to detect any changes or worsening of his chronic renal insufficiency.
* Blood transfusions: The patient may require blood transfusions to support his anemia and thrombocytopenia.

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.
   IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   likely source of infection and was removed yesterday with tip culture
   pending.  Patient with 3 sets of cultures with GNR (10/6+[**10-19**]) not yet
   speciated  but sensitive to ceftazidime and TMP/SMX but resistant to
   meropenem and tobramycin.  Patient was started on ceftazidime
   yesterday.  Patient hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of
   SIRS.
   - Continue ceftazidime for GNR coverage as well as voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - PICC placement today
   - Follow-up with ID
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - CMV VL, urinary Legionella, C.diff, HSV negative, beta-glucan and
   serum galactomanna pending.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Patient currently
   with hypoxemia on a face tent.  Unclear etiology to persistent
   hypoxemia, but likely multifactorial including intrinsic lung disease,
   early ARDS, and fluid overload.
   - ABG today
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Diuresis with net goal of -1000cc.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - will follow
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN:
   - Restart carvedilol today
   - Hold lisinopril and restart tomorrow if hemodynamically stable.
   - Restart lasix today, net balance goal of -1000cc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. He has a Hickman line that was removed due to suspected infection, and subsequent cultures revealed GNR sensitivity to ceftazidime and TMP/SMX but resistance to meropenem and tobramycin. The patient is currently receiving ceftazidime and voriconazole, and a PICC line is planned for placement today.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with persistent hypoxemia despite being on a face tent. The etiology of this hypoxemia is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial, including intrinsic lung disease, early ARDS, and fluid overload.

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with an elevated creatinine level since September. The etiology of this is unclear, but the patient has had a negative renal ultrasound during his last admission.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hypertension, which are being managed accordingly. He has a history of AML and is currently in remission following a cord transplant.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and hypoxemia put him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxemia and possible early ARDS put him at risk for developing respiratory failure, which can require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and possible fluid overload put him at risk for developing acute kidney injury, which can further exacerbate his kidney dysfunction.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible coagulopathy put him at risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Infection: The patient's GNR bacteremia and possible pneumonia put him at risk for developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and possible cardiac dysfunction put him at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent and treat them effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.

   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   likely source of infection and was removed yesterday with tip culture
   pending.  Patient with 3 sets of cultures with GNR (10/6+[**10-19**]) not yet
   speciated  but sensitive to ceftazidime and TMP/SMX but resistant to
   meropenem and tobramycin.  Patient was started on ceftazidime
   yesterday.  Patient hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of
   SIRS.
   - Continue ceftazidime for GNR coverage as well as voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - PICC placement today
   - Follow-up with ID
   - Surveillance cultures
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - CMV VL, urinary Legionella, C.diff, HSV negative, beta-glucan and
   serum galactomanna pending.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with transient hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia in setting of flushing Hickman, again likely transient SIRS
   secondary to GNR release into systemic vasculature.  Patient currently
   with hypoxemia on a face tent.  Unclear etiology to persistent
   hypoxemia, but likely multifactorial including intrinsic lung disease,
   early ARDS, and fluid overload.
   - ABG today
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Diuresis with net goal of -1000cc.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - will follow
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU with GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's Hickman line was removed, and tip culture is pending. The patient has been started on ceftazidime, and surveillance cultures are being performed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercarbia may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic renal insufficiency increase the risk of AKI, which can lead to further complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's current platelet count is at baseline levels, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 24.1 g/dL, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of aspergillosis and is being treated with voriconazole, which may increase the risk of fungal infections.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with carvedilol, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal medication, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.

The patient's current medications include ceftazidime, voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir. The patient is also receiving insulin, and his glucose levels are being monitored. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, are being monitored.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/88 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on a face tent. His white blood cell count is 10.7 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 54 x 10^9/L.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk patient with multiple medical complications, including bacteremia, respiratory distress, and chronic renal insufficiency. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CXR ([**9-21**]): Improving edema, not necessarily cardiogenic.
   TTE ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on
   the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-11**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is somewhat
   reduced.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed. .

   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman
   likely source of infection and was removed yesterday with tip culture
   pending.  Patient with 3 sets of cultures with GNR (10/6+[**10-19**]) not yet
   speciated (per ID, likely in Pseudomonas family) but sensitive to
   ceftazidime and TMP/SMX but resistant to meropenem and tobramycin.
   Patient was started on ceftazidime yesterday.  Patient hemodynamically
   stable overnight without signs of SIRS.
   - Continue ceftazidime for GNR coverage as well as voriconazole,
   atovaquone, and acyclovir.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the ICU with GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient had a Hickman line that was flushed, which is likely the source of the infection. The patient was started on ceftazidime and has shown improvement in his respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still has a CXR demonstrating right-sided opacity, which could indicate new pneumonia or transient collapse secondary to mucus plug.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which could indicate chronic kidney disease. The etiology of this is unclear, but the patient has had a negative renal ultrasound during his last admission.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is currently at baseline levels, which could indicate thrombocytopenia. This is likely secondary to his malignancy.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is currently 24.1, which is below his baseline level. He may require transfusions if his hemoglobin level continues to decline.
6. Aspergillosis: The patient is being treated for aspergillosis with voriconazole, but the infection could recur if not properly managed.
7. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with carvedilol and lisinopril. He may require further adjustments to his medication regimen to control his blood pressure.
8. Pain: The patient is experiencing pain, which is being managed with neurontin and oxycodone. He may require further adjustments to his pain regimen to manage his symptoms effectively.
9. BOOP: The patient is being treated for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with steroids and cellcept. He may require further treatment to manage his symptoms and prevent complications.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia and anemia. He may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent bleeding.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include:

1. Continued treatment for GNR bacteremia with ceftazidime and surveillance cultures.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and treatment for any signs of respiratory failure.
3. Management of the patient's chronic kidney disease, including close monitoring of his creatinine levels and consideration of a renal consult for possible renal biopsy.
4. Treatment for thrombocytopenia and anemia, including transfusions as necessary.
5. Continued treatment for aspergillosis with voriconazole and close monitoring for signs of recurrence.
6. Management of the patient's hypertension with carvedilol and lisinopril.
7. Pain management with neurontin and oxycodone.
8. Treatment for BOOP with steroids and cellcept.
9. Close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].  3
   sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR likely
   Stenotrophomonas resistant to meropenem and tobramycin but sensitive to
   TMP/SMX and ceftazidime. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Continue ceftazidime and TMP/SMX for GNR coverage
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up with ID regarding duration of antimicrobial therapy.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline.  Currently on face mask for breathing
   treatment, but was down to high flow nasal cannula overnight. Increased
   oxygen requirement likely multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung
   disease, early ARDS, and fluid overload.  Patient was net -1014cc
   yesterday, CXR this AM largely unimproved from yesterday.
   - Check ABG
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - will follow
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].  3
   sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated as
   Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX with ceftazidime sensitivity
   pending.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX and hold
   ceftazidime.
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up with formal ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline.  Currently on face mask for breathing
   treatment, but was down to high flow nasal cannula overnight. Increased
   oxygen requirement likely multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung
   disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid overload.  Patient was net -1014cc yesterday,
   CXR this AM largely unimproved from yesterday.
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - Trend plt
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for gram-negative bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's Hickman line, which was the likely source of the bacteremia, has been removed with tip culture without significant growth.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 136/88 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (inspiratory)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.1%
* Platelet count: 52 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* TMP/SMX for gram-negative bacteremia
* Carvedilol for hypertension
* Voriconazole for aspergillosis
* Atovaquone for pneumocystis pneumonia
* Acyclovir for herpes simplex virus
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Lasix for fluid overload
* Neurontin for pain management
* Oxycodone for pain management
* Cellcept for autoimmune disorders
* Steroids for autoimmune disorders

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing TMP/SMX for gram-negative bacteremia
* Titrating supplemental oxygen as possible
* Continuing diuresis with home lasix dose, aiming for a net loss of 1000 mL
* Trending creatinine and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Transfusing platelets if the count is <10 K/uL or if there is active bleeding
* Trending hemoglobin and transfusing if the level is <21%
* Following up with oncology recommendations
* Continuing voriconazole for aspergillosis
* Restarting carvedilol and furosemide for hypertension
* Holding lisinopril
* Maintaining electrolyte balance
* Managing pain with neurontin and oxycodone
* Continuing steroids and cellcept for autoimmune disorders

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis due to gram-negative bacteremia
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and fluid overload
* Acute kidney injury due to hypotension and nephrotoxic medications
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to aspergillosis and pneumocystis pneumonia
* Hypertension due to fluid overload and medications
* Fluid overload due to diuresis and fluid administration
* Pain management issues due to inadequate pain control

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].  3
   sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR likely
   Stenotrophomonas resistant to meropenem and tobramycin but sensitive to
   TMP/SMX and ceftazidime. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Continue ceftazidime and TMP/SMX for GNR coverage
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up with ID regarding duration of antimicrobial therapy.
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline.  Currently on face mask for breathing
   treatment, but was down to high flow nasal cannula overnight. Increased
   oxygen requirement likely multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung
   disease, early ARDS, and fluid overload.  Patient was net -1014cc
   yesterday, CXR this AM largely unimproved from yesterday.
   - Check ABG
   - Titrate supplemental O2
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission.  Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - will follow
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN:
   - Restart carvedilol today
   - Hold lisinopril and restart tomorrow if hemodynamically stable.
   - Restart lasix today, net balance goal of -1000cc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 53-year-old gentleman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), was readmitted to the ICU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving treatment for GNR bacteremia with ceftazidime and TMP/SMX, and has been hemodynamically stable. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring increased supplemental oxygen, and fluid overload is suspected. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is stable, but the etiology is unclear. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to malignancy, and anemia is present. The patient has a history of AML, and is currently in remission following a cord transplant. The patient's pain is being managed with neurontin and oxycodone, and they have a history of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and aspergillosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring increased supplemental oxygen, and fluid overload is suspected. This could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is stable, but the etiology is unclear. If not managed properly, this could lead to acute renal failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of aspergillosis and BOOP, which could lead to infection if not managed properly.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia could worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload could worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for GNR bacteremia with ceftazidime and TMP/SMX.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust supplemental oxygen as needed.
3. Continue diuresis with home lasix dose to manage fluid overload.
4. Trend creatinine and adjust dosing of medications accordingly to manage chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary to manage thrombocytopenia.
6. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and transfuse if necessary to manage anemia.
7. Continue steroids and cellcept to manage BOOP.
8. Continue voriconazole to manage aspergillosis.
9. Restart carvedilol and lisinopril as directed to manage hypertension.
10. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust dosing of medications accordingly to manage diabetes."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].
   Multiple sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated
   as Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX & ceftazidime.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX (dosed 15mg/kg)
   and d/ced ceftazidime.
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline (home 02 1.5L at rest, 3L
   ambulating).  Currently on face mask for breathing treatment, but also
   on 3.0L nasal cannula overnight. Increased oxygen requirement likely
   multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid
   overload.  Patient was net -1070cc yesterday, CXR this AM did not show
   significant change and respiratory status slightly improved. .
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve with diuresis due to h/o of  BOOP or
   other possible acute etiology.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission. Today Cr 1.7, elevated from 1.5
   yesterday.  Near recent baseline. Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   Increase likely due to diuresis and intravascular depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - Trend plt
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN: Cont carvedilol and furosemide.
   - Can restart lisinopril.
   .
   # FEN: Regular, replete as necessary
   .
   # PPX: SCDs and PPI
   .
   # CODE: FULL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1414**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
   AML readmitted to FIU for GNR bacteremia and transient acute
   respiratory distress and hypoxemia in setting of his Hickman being
   flushed.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Patient readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with GNR bacteremia.  Hickman,
   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].
   Multiple sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated
   as Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX & ceftazidime.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX (dosed 15mg/kg)
   and d/ced ceftazidime.
   - Continue voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
   - Surveillance cultures with AML
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Follow-up with ID recs
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with increased supplemental
   oxygen requirement from baseline (home 02 1.5L at rest, 3L
   ambulating).  Currently on face mask for breathing treatment, but also
   on 3.0L nasal cannula overnight. Increased oxygen requirement likely
   multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid
   overload.  Patient was net -1070cc yesterday, CXR this AM did not show
   significant change and respiratory status slightly improved. .
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve with diuresis due to h/o of  BOOP or
   other possible acute etiology.
   .
   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission. Today Cr 1.7, elevated from 1.5
   yesterday.  Near recent baseline. Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   Increase likely due to diuresis and intravascular depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Currrently at baseline levels. Likely secondary to
   malignancy.
   - Trend plt
   - transfuse if plt<10 or if active bleeding
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-30. Hct this AM 24.1.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21.
   .
   # AML: S/p cord transplant now in remission. Follow-up with onc recs.
   .
   # PAIN: continue home neurontin 300mg po bid (renally dosed) and
   oxycodone prn.
   .
   # BOOP: Continue steroids and cellcept.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve
   .
   # Aspergillosis:
   - continue voriconazole 300mg po q12hrs
   .
   # HTN: Cont carvedilol and furosemide.
   - Can restart lisinopril.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis, organ dysfunction, and mortality due to bacteremia.
2. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they have a history of chronic kidney disease. This increases the risk of acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of chronic lung disease, and their oxygen requirement is increasing. This increases the risk of respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia.
6. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to bacteremia, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and mortality.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient has a net negative fluid balance, which can lead to hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and organ dysfunction.
8. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, which can lead to tissue hypoxia, organ dysfunction, and mortality.
9. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is worsening, which increases the risk of ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and hypoxemia.
10. Malignancy: The patient has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which increases the risk of relapse, treatment-related toxicity, and mortality.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, respiratory distress, and organ dysfunction. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and diuresis should be continued to reduce fluid overload. The patient's platelet count and hemoglobin level should be closely monitored, and transfusions should be considered if necessary. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and oxygen therapy should be adjusted accordingly. The patient's creatinine level should be closely monitored, and nephrotoxic medications should be avoided."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   which was the likely source, has been removed with tip culture without
   significant growth.  Patient with blood cultures NGTD since [**10-20**].
   Multiple sets of blood cultures from 10/6-7 positive for GNR speciated
   as Stenotrophomonas sensitive to TMP/SMX & ceftazidime.
   - Discussed with ID, and will continue with TMP/SMX (dosed 15mg/kg)
   and d/ced ceftazidime.

   oxygen requirement from baseline (home 02 1.5L at rest, 3L
   ambulating).  Currently on face mask for breathing treatment, but also
   on 3.0L nasal cannula overnight. Increased oxygen requirement likely
   multifactorial including prior intrinsic lung disease, [**Doctor Last Name **], and fluid
   overload.  Patient was net -1070cc yesterday, CXR this AM did not show
   significant change and respiratory status slightly improved. .
   - Titrate supplemental O2 as possible
   - Continue diuresis with home lasix dose, net goal of -1000cc.
   - t/c CT-chest if does not improve with diuresis due to h/o of  BOOP or
   other possible acute etiology.

   # Chronic renal Insufficiency: Elevated Cr since [**Month (only) 705**]. Currently
   stable since last prior admission. Today Cr 1.7, elevated from 1.5
   yesterday.  Near recent baseline. Unclear etiology to renal failure,
   but patient has had negative renal ultrasound during last admission.
   Increase likely due to diuresis and intravascular depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   .

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic kidney disease.
* He is currently admitted to the ICU with bacteremia caused by Stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and ceftazidime.
* He has a Hickman catheter that was removed and cultured without significant growth.
* He has been receiving antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, and has been started on voriconazole, atovaquone, and acyclovir.
* He has respiratory distress and hypoxemia, requiring increased supplemental oxygen.
* He has chronic renal insufficiency, with an elevated creatinine level, and is being managed with diuresis and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
* He has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and is being managed with transfusions as needed.
* He has a history of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and is being managed with steroids and cellcept.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis and organ dysfunction: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory distress increase the risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and elevated creatinine level increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his oxygen requirement does not improve with diuresis and other interventions.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if his platelet count drops further.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of BOOP increase the risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens such as Aspergillus.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic kidney disease and use of anticoagulant medications increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Plan:**

* Continue antibiotics and antifungal medications as prescribed.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue diuresis and monitor the patient's creatinine level to prevent worsening of chronic kidney disease.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as needed to prevent bleeding complications.
* Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
* Continue steroids and cellcept for BOOP and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Consider restarting lisinopril and other medications as indicated.
* Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic renal insufficiency, is being treated for bacteremia caused by Stenotrophomonas, which was likely acquired through his Hickman catheter. He has been readmitted to the ICU for GNR bacteremia, transient acute respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/72 mmHg. He is receiving antibiotics, including Bactrim, and has had his Hickman catheter removed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fever could lead to sepsis, which could progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and increased oxygen requirement could lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his underlying chronic lung disease.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency could worsen if not managed properly, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's current thrombocytopenia could worsen if not managed with platelet transfusions, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not managed with blood transfusions, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Infection: The patient's bacteremia could lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, which could worsen his condition.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying chronic conditions, such as chronic kidney disease and chronic lung disease, could worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ dysfunction.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Titrate supplemental oxygen as possible and continue diuresis to manage fluid overload.
3. Trend creatinine and avoid nephrotoxins to manage chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Monitor platelet count and transfuse if necessary to manage thrombocytopenia.
5. Trend hemoglobin and transfuse if necessary to manage anemia.
6. Continue steroids and cellcept to manage BOOP.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and manage promptly if necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of organ dysfunction and manage promptly if necessary.
9. Continue to follow up with oncology and ID recommendations."

   1) ID:  + stenotrophomonas bacteremia.  Currently HD stable and
   afebrile.  No leukocytosis.
   - Continue bactrim IV per ID
   - f/u any ID recs
   - Will send sputum culture
   2) Hypoxemia: suspect mild ARDS related to bacteremia.  However, with
   history of BOOP, is more concerning.  Will trial of weaning O2 today if
   unable to make any progress, will consider repeat imaging with
   non-contrast chest CT.
   - Continue diuresis as he is tolerating.  TBB negative 1-1.5L today
   with lasix.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - non-contrast CT today if unable to make any progress on oxygenation
   despite significant diuresis.
   3) h/o BOOP:
   - continues on prednisone/cellcept
   4) H/o aspergillus:
   - continue voriconazole

The patient is a 71-inch tall male, weighing 111 kg, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of stenotrophomonas bacteremia. He is currently clinically stable without significant change from yesterday. He continues to diurese, but has minimal improvement in his oxygenation.

The patient has a history of BOOP and aspergillus, and is currently being treated with prednisone, cellcept, and voriconazole.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 72 bpm (69-96 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/87 mmHg (99-154/94-106 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (18-36 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8-8.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.2-8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 43-61 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4-1.7 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 23-27 mmHg
* Glucose: 76-172 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.2/26.2/1.1, ALT/AST: 31/29, Alk Phos/T Bili: 112/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 81.6%, Band: 1.0%, Lymph: 10.3%, Mono: 7.3%, Eos: 0.6%, Fibrinogen: 428 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L, LDH: 269 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypoxemia: the patient's oxygenation has not improved despite diuresis, and he may require repeat imaging with non-contrast chest CT.
* ARDS: the patient's history of BOOP and mild ARDS-related bacteremia may increase his risk of developing ARDS.
* Aspergillosis: the patient's history of aspergillus infection may increase his risk of developing aspergillosis.
* BOOP: the patient's history of BOOP may increase his risk of developing BOOP again.
* Sepsis: the patient's bacteremia may increase his risk of developing sepsis.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing bactrim IV per ID
* Trial of weaning O2 today if unable to make any progress
* Repeat imaging with non-contrast chest CT if unable to make any progress on oxygenation
* Continuing diuresis as tolerated
* Continuing prednisone and cellcept for BOOP
* Continuing voriconazole for aspergillus
* Full code status"

Summary:

The patient remains clinically stable without significant change from yesterday. He continues to diurese, but has minimal improvement in oxygenation. The patient has a history of BOOP and aspergillosis, and is currently being treated for Stenotrophomonas bacteremia. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged oxygen dependence: The patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, and he may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of BOOP and suspected ARDS increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and suspected ARDS may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's diuresis may be insufficient to manage fluid overload, leading to acute kidney injury.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemia and glycemic control measures in place may lead to hypoglycemic episodes.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding diathesis and stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
8. Infection-related complications: The patient's bacteremia and suspected ARDS may lead to infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or abscesses.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis and monitor the patient's fluid status closely.
2. Wean oxygen therapy as tolerated, and consider non-contrast chest CT if unable to make progress.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk, and consider platelet transfusions as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider repeating imaging studies to monitor the patient's response to therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) ID:  + stenotrophomonas bacteremia.  Currently HD stable and
   afebrile.  No leukocytosis.
   - Continue bactrim IV per ID
   - f/u any ID recs
   - Will send sputum culture
   2) Hypoxemia: suspect mild ARDS related to bacteremia.  However, with
   history of BOOP, is more concerning.
       Will trial of weaning O2 today if unable to make any progress, will
   consider repeat imaging with non-contrast chest CT.
   - Continue diuresis as he is tolerating.  1-1.5L today  with lasix.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - non-contrast CT today if unable to make any progress on oxygenation
   despite significant diuresis.
   3) h/o BOOP:
   - continues on prednisone/cellcept
   4) H/o aspergillus:
   - continue voriconazole

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient remains clinically stable with minimal improvement in oxygenation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 139/87 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool 4L NC + FM.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 43. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 31 and AST of 29. The patient's blood chemistry results show a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include bacteremia, suspected mild ARDS, and a history of BOOP and aspergillosis. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungal therapy. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of ARDS: The patient's oxygenation is still not improving, and the patient may be at risk of developing more severe ARDS.
2. Bacterial sepsis: The patient has bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly managed.
3. BOOP exacerbation: The patient has a history of BOOP, and the current respiratory symptoms may be exacerbating the condition.
4. Aspergillosis progression: The patient has a history of aspergillosis, and the current antifungal therapy may not be effective in preventing progression of the disease.
5. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving large amounts of fluids, which can lead to fluid overload and cardiac compromise.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving sliding scale insulin for glycemic control, and there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
8. Stress ulcer bleeding: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcers, but there is still a risk of bleeding complications.
9. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics, diuretics, and antifungal therapy, as well as monitoring for signs of worsening ARDS, sepsis, BOOP exacerbation, and aspergillosis progression. The patient's oxygenation will be reassessed today, and a non-contrast chest CT will be considered if the patient does not show improvement."
