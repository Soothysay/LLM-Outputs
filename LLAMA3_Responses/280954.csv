   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Family gives history of being more
   tired and lethargic x few days, perhaps due to hypoventilation.
   Patient with severe COPD at baseline, presenting with hypoxia and ABG
   showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Possible viral prodrome
   with resultant COPD exacerbation.  Also with OSA and ?recent with CPAP
   compliance per family - this may have worsened hypoventilation.  Also
   concern of patient falling - CNS bleed ruled out by prelim head CT
   read.  Patient with baseline hypoxia but was significantly hypoxic upon
   presentation - obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs. infectious
   process.
   - f/u final read of  head and chest CTs.
   - Frequent neuro checks.
   - Workup of ?RUL process (simple nodule/tumor (BAC in particular) vs.
   post obstructive or consolidative process - will send for chest CT at
   same time. Also will send AFB sputums to r/o TB, continue respiratory
   airborne precautions.
   - Consider viral swabs.
   - F/u sputum culture, and blood cultures.
   - Check TTE for eval valvular disease and systolic function.
   - Coverage of CAP and aspiration pneumonias with levo/flagyl; will also
   give vanc for MRSA coverage though less likely.
   - COPD exacerbation management with solumedrol (60 IV Q8 tonight and
   starting 60 pred this AM).
   - ATC and prn nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - Continue on AC settings while workup being done; SBT as early as AM
   though may be prolonged course before ready for vent liberation given
   underlying lung disease.  Need to discuss concerns further with family
   after above workup completed.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   - Hold off on CVL for now.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Steroids IV and start PO prednisone tomorrow.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia, vs.
   distributive or cardiogenic shock.  Improving with Cr of 2.8 this
   morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Hold ACEI.
   --  More likely prerenal now, can give gentle IVF until better
   assessment of cardiac function.
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  First 2 sets CEs
   underwhelming.
   - Continue to cycle.
   - ECG this morning.
   - Check TTE.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Check smear.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and presenting with shortness of breath, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and possible viral prodrome. The patient has severe COPD at baseline, and the current presentation is likely due to an exacerbation of COPD.

The patient's CT chest shows irregular consolidation and nodularity in the right upper lobe, with variable-sized cavities at the right apex, suggesting infection, and cannot rule out TB. The CT head shows pan-sinus disease, fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air cells, and complete opacification of the right mastoid air cells.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.7-6.0
* Hct: 26.1-23.6
* Plt: 145-133
* Cr: 3.5-2.8
* TropT: 0.04
* TCO2: 32-34
* Glucose: 130-151

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a low Hct and platelet count. The anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, and the thrombocytopenia is unclear.

The patient's vital signs show:

* Tmax: 37.8
* Tcurrent: 37.3
* HR: 94 (73-97) bpm
* BP: 96/52 (66) mmHg

* FiO2: 50%
* RSBI: 70
* PIP: 27 cmH2O
* Plateau: 14 cmH2O
* Compliance: 71.4 cmH2O/mL

The patient's ABG shows:

* pH: 7.34
* PaCO2: 61
* PaO2: 172
* HCO3: 86
* BE: 31
* SaO2: 95%

The patient's medical plan includes:

* F/u final read of head and chest CTs
* Frequent neuro checks
* Workup of RUL process (simple nodule/tumor vs. post-obstructive or consolidative process)
* Send AFB sputums to rule out TB, continue respiratory airborne precautions
* Consider viral swabs
* F/u sputum culture, and blood cultures
* Check TTE for eval valvular disease and systolic function
* Coverage of CAP and aspiration pneumonias with levo/flagyl
* COPD exacerbation management with solumedrol and prednisone
* ATC and prn nebs
* Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to extubation
* Continue on AC settings while workup being done; SBT as early as AM though may be prolonged course before ready for vent liberation given underlying lung disease

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Infection, such as TB, pneumonia, or sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias
* Renal failure due to prerenal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Family gives history of being more
   tired and lethargic x few days, perhaps due to hypoventilation.
   Patient with severe COPD at baseline, presenting with hypoxia and ABG
   showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Possible viral prodrome
   with resultant COPD exacerbation.  Also with OSA and ?recent with CPAP
   compliance per family - this may have worsened hypoventilation.  Also
   concern of patient falling - CNS bleed ruled out by prelim head CT
   read.  Patient with baseline hypoxia but was significantly hypoxic upon
   presentation - obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs. infectious
   process.
   - f/u final read of  head and chest CTs.
   - Frequent neuro checks..
   - F/u sputum culture, and blood cultures.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl; will also give vanc for MRSA coverage though less likely.
   Given sputum gram stain, d/c flagyl today.
   - Check TTE for eval valvular disease and systolic function.
   - COPD exacerbation management with solumedrol (60 IV Q8 tonight and
   starting 60 pred this AM).
   - ATC and prn nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - SBT as early as AM though may be prolonged course before ready for
   vent liberation given underlying lung disease.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   - Hold off on CVL for now.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Steroids IV and start PO prednisone tomorrow.
   - Antibiotics as above.

   distributive or cardiogenic shock.  Improving with Cr of 2.8 this
   morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and presenting with shortness of breath, now with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/52 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 61 mmHg, and PO2 of 86 mmHg. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the sputum gram stain shows >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, with 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, hypertension, and possibly recent compliance issues with CPAP therapy, which may have worsened hypoventilation. The patient's recent lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, with a BUN/Cr ratio of 69/4.2 in the emergency department.

The patient's current medications include levofloxacin, metronidazole, and famotidine, with plans to discontinue flagyl due to the sputum gram stain results. The patient is also receiving steroids for COPD exacerbation management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, which may be indicative of a severe infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio of 69/4.2 in the emergency department suggests acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be due to underlying COPD, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. OSA: The patient's history of OSA and recent compliance issues with CPAP therapy may worsen hypoventilation and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension and possible cardiac valvular disease may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   ECHO: mildly dilated LA. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle. No
   clinically-significant valvular disease seen.

   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation showed
   increasing PCO2 and decreasing pH. Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 in
   attempt to offset some of pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: CXR [**1-18**]: Right upper lobe process is consistent with pneumonia
   or neoplasm.
   Final Chest CT read:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Probably right upper lobe pneumonia. Six-week followup radiograph to
   document resolution is recommended to exclude an underlying neoplasm.
   2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
   3. T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
   4. Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized. Recommend correlation
   with
   US.
   5. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
   Final Head CT Read:
   MPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
   2. 10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying
   bony
   abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous
   tissues.
   3. Pansinus disease, with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air
   cells
   and complete opacification of right mastoid air cells.
   ECHO: mildly dilated LA. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle. No
   clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
   Microbiology: BAL [**1-18**]: gram stain neg. No microorganisms seen.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation showed
   increasing PCO2 and decreasing pH. Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 in
   attempt to offset some of pt
s metabolic acidosis that may be
   contributing to acidemia, and will attempt extubation later today.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely triggered by pneumonia.

The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Mild LVH with EF 75%, mild diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram.
2. Right upper lobe process on CXR consistent with pneumonia or neoplasm, with a pending chest CT read.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions on CXR.
4. T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity on CXR.
5. Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized on CXR.
6. Probable pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram.
7. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional wall motion on echocardiogram.
8. Hyperdynamic LV systolic function (EF >75%) with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram.
9. Trivial MR and small pericardial effusion on echocardiogram.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated white blood cell count (181 K/uL).
2. Elevated troponin-T (0.04 ng/mL).
3. Elevated lactate acid (0.7 mmol/L).
4. Anemia (Hct 25.8%) with unclear cause.
5. Thrombocytopenia (PLT 145 K/uL) with unclear cause.
6. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels, likely due to pre-renal failure.
7. Elevated levels of troponin-T and lactate acid, indicating possible cardiac and metabolic stress.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia coverage with levofloxacin and vancomycin.
2. Steroids for COPD exacerbation management.
3. Lasix to offset metabolic acidosis and attempt extubation.
4. Bolus prn fluids to manage borderline hypotension.
5. Monitoring of strict ins and outs to avoid fluid overload.
6. Trending of BUN/Cr levels to monitor renal function.
7. Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs and renally dosed medications.
8. Holding off on diuretics unless needed.
9. Considering CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) once extubated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia progression or development of secondary bacterial infections.
2. Respiratory failure or worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to diastolic dysfunction.
4. Renal failure or worsening acute renal failure.
5. Anemia or thrombocytopenia worsening or development of new bleeding complications.
6. Metabolic acidosis or worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis or severe pneumonia due to bacterial infections.
8. OSA worsening or development of new sleep-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with hypercarbic respiratory failure and severe respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, pulmonary nodules, and chronic kidney disease. 

The patient's recent events include bronchoscopy, sputum culture, and endotracheal sputum gram stain, which demonstrated gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 131/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, and the patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic findings. 

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray (CXR) showing a right upper lobe process consistent with pneumonia or neoplasm, and an echocardiogram (ECHO) showing mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. 

The patient's microbiology results are pending, but the gram stain of the endotracheal sputum is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following problems: 

1. Right upper lobe infiltrate or mass
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
3. Pulmonary nodules
4. Hypotension
5. Chronic renal failure
6. Acute renal failure
7. Respiratory failure
8. ICU care

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's gram-positive cocci in pairs on the endotracheal sputum gram stain may indicate a bacterial infection, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they are at risk of developing further acute kidney injury.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if they do not receive proper treatment.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy may indicate cardiac complications.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypotension and respiratory failure may increase their risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
7. Infection: The patient's pending microbiology results may indicate an infection, which can lead to further complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation triggered by
   possible worsening obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs.
   infectious process or some combination of these.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily.
   - ATC and nebs.
   - Hold off on diuresis for now, though may need some prior to
   extubation.
   - SBT as early as AM though may be prolonged course before ready for
   vent liberation given underlying lung disease.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a recent increase in PaO2 and a decrease in FiO2. However, he still has a prolonged expiratory phase and a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute.

The patient's cardiac status is also notable. His ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 67 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 131/54 mmHg, which is within normal limits. His cardiac function is hyperdynamic, with an EF of 75%, but he has mild diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a BUN/Cr ratio of 68/1.8. His creatinine has decreased from 4.2 to 1.8, and his urine output is stable. He is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying COPD and potential fluid overload.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely related to his underlying COPD and chronic disease. His hemoglobin is 8.2 g/dL, and his platelet count is 145 x 10^9/L. His TSH is normal, and his guaiac stools are negative.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7 x 10^9/L, with a differential count of 91.7% neutrophils, 6.3% lymphocytes, and 1.8% monocytes. His blood cultures are pending, and his rapid respiratory viral screen and culture are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. He is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying COPD and potential fluid overload.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is hyperdynamic, but he has mild diastolic dysfunction. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying COPD and potential fluid overload.
4. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and his rapid respiratory viral screen and culture are pending. He is at risk for infection due to his underlying COPD and potential fluid overload.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 145 x 10^9/L, which is within normal limits. However, he is at risk for bleeding due to his underlying COPD and potential fluid overload.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Imaging: CXR [**1-18**]: Right upper lobe process is consistent with pneumonia
   or neoplasm.
   Final Chest CT read:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Probably right upper lobe pneumonia. Six-week followup radiograph to
   document resolution is recommended to exclude an underlying neoplasm.
   2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
   3. T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
   4. Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized. Recommend correlation
   with
   US.
   5. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
   Final Head CT Read:
   MPRESSION:
   1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
   2. 10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying
   bony
   abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous
   tissues.
   3. Pansinus disease, with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air
   cells
   and complete opacification of right mastoid air cells.
   ECHO: mildly dilated LA. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Hyperdynamic LV systolic fcn
   (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. Trivial MR. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle. No
   clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
   Microbiology: BAL [**1-18**]: gram stain neg. No microorganisms seen.
   Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
   pending.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia, likely caused by pneumococcus. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 479 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. His oxygenation is improving, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 226. He is also receiving antibiotics, including levofloxacin, and corticosteroids.

The patient has several comorbidities, including mild diastolic heart dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. His blood cultures are pending, and his BAL gram stain is negative. His sputum culture is pending, but his preliminary results show GPCs in pairs, likely indicating pneumococcus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely caused by pneumococcus, and he may require prolonged antibiotic therapy to treat the infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by prerenal factors, including hypovolemia and poor forward flow. He will require close monitoring of his fluid status and electrolyte levels.
3. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely caused by his underlying COPD and may require treatment with blood transfusions or other medications.
4. Diastolic Heart Dysfunction: The patient's mild diastolic heart dysfunction may require treatment with diuretics or other medications to improve his cardiac function.
5. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to improve his oxygenation.
6. Pneumococcal Pneumonia: The patient's pneumococcal pneumonia may require prolonged antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
7. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation may require treatment with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and other medications to improve his lung function and symptoms.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 479 mL and a PEEP of 0 cmH2O.
2. Administer antibiotics, including levofloxacin, and corticosteroids as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and sputum culture results and adjust his antibiotic therapy accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid therapy and medication regimen as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's oxygenation and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his diuretic therapy and other medications as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust his bronchodilator therapy and other medications as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Extubated yesterday
   without difficulty. Most recent ABG reassuring.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily,
   could start tapering. Continue bronchodilator therapy.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.1
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 57/1.1.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACE-I
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 195.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 27.
   - Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night now that pt is extubated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday without difficulty and is currently on CPAP support. His most recent ABG results are reassuring. The patient's condition is likely due to a COPD exacerbation triggered by pneumonia, with mild fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which could lead to worsening lung function and increased risk of mortality.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum gram stain and culture results are pending, but it is possible that he may have developed pneumonia, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, and he is at risk of developing acute renal failure, which could lead to worsening kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to underlying COPD, but it is essential to monitor his hemoglobin and platelet count closely to prevent further complications.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of hypertension and COPD puts him at risk of developing osteoporosis, which could lead to increased risk of fractures and other complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and hypertension put him at risk of developing cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Sepsis: Given the patient's pneumonia and possible bacteremia, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and increased risk of mortality.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Extubated yesterday
   without difficulty. Most recent ABG reassuring.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily,
   could start tapering. Continue bronchodilator therapy.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

* The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, currently receiving oxygen therapy at home.
* She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was extubated yesterday without difficulty.
* The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely triggered by COPD exacerbation, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are being managed accordingly.
* The patient is being treated with CPAP for OSA and is receiving nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to her COPD exacerbation and pneumonia diagnosis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and pneumonia diagnosis increase her risk of developing ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure and high BUN/Cr ratio increase her risk of developing AKI.
4. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia diagnosis and high WBC count increase her risk of developing sepsis.
5. OSA: The patient's OSA diagnosis increases her risk of developing respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
6. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation increases her risk of developing respiratory failure and pneumonia.
7. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia increase her risk of bleeding and anemia-related complications.
8. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid overload and hypovolemia increase her risk of developing hypotension and organ dysfunction.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and kidney dysfunction increase her risk of developing electrolyte-related complications, such as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias.

These potential medical complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent and treat them effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Extubated yesterday
   without difficulty. Most recent ABG reassuring.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily,
   could start tapering. Continue bronchodilator therapy.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.

   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.1
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 57/1.1.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACE-I

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Condition:**

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday without difficulty and is currently on auto-set CPAP overnight.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, indicating prerenal failure likely due to poor forward flow and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of strict ins and outs, BUN/Cr trends, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs are necessary.
2. **COPD Exacerbation:** The patient's COPD exacerbation is likely triggered by pneumonia, and management includes antibiotics, bronchodilator therapy, and corticosteroids. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
3. **Anemia and Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, and his thrombocytopenia is unclear. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet counts is necessary.
4. **Osteoporosis:** The patient's history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure increases his risk of osteoporosis. Monitoring of bone density and prevention of falls are necessary.
5. **Pneumonia:** The patient's sputum gram stain is positive for Gram-positive cocci, and his sputum culture is pending. Close monitoring of respiratory status and antibiotic therapy is necessary.
6. **Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:** The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is ongoing, and close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
7. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels is necessary.
8. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, are abnormal. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and replacement as necessary is necessary.

**Plan:**

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
2. Monitor and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
3. Continue bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids for COPD exacerbation.
4. Monitor and adjust fluid status and electrolyte levels as necessary.
5. Monitor and adjust blood glucose levels as necessary.
6. Continue to hold ACE-I due to acute renal failure.
7. Monitor and adjust CPAP therapy as necessary.
8. Repeat chest CTs in six weeks to evaluate for possible neoplasm.
9. Continue to monitor patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   sparse GNRs on sputum culture
   Assessment and Plan
   70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of
   breath now with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: COPD exacerbation most likely
   triggered by pneumonia given results of sputum gram stain and mild
   fluid overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
   - Chest CTs final read most c/w PNA, but will repeat radiographs in 6
   weeks to evaluate further for possible neoplasm.
   - F/u final sputum culture prelim GPC in pair, likely pneumococcus.
   - F/u final  blood cultures NG x 2 days.
   - Initially, started on CAP and aspiration PNA coverage with
   levo/flagyl and vanco.  Now on levoflox only after sputum prelim
   obtained.
   - Systolic function hyperdynamic, but pt with mild diastolic heart
   dysfunction; continue to hold off on diuretics unless needed.
   - COPD exacerbation management with steroids; on 60 mg pred daily, ATC
   and nebs.
   - SBT this AM with repeat gas to assess if ready for extubation showed
   increasing PCO2 and decreasing pH. Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 in
   attempt to offset some of pt
s metabolic acidosis that may be
   contributing to acidemia, and will attempt extubation later today.
   .
   # Borderline hypotension.  Improving as course goes on, now SBPs >100
   consistently.  Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but may
   be simply dry from history of poor PO intake.
   - Bolus prn, watch UOP.
   .
   # COPD.  Exacerbation as above.
   - Continue PO prednisone.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]). Likely prerenal given BUN/Cr >20%, FeNa 0.2% and FeUrea 35%.
   Likely d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.  Improving with Cr of 1.8
   this morning.
   -- Monitor strict ins and outs.
   -- Trend BUN/Cr, improved today at 68/1.8.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and renally dose all medications.
   -- Continue to hold ACEI
   .
   # ECG changes.  Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions.  CEs underwhelming.
   - ECG without acute changes.
   .
   # Anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hct last known 29 in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Unclear
   reason for low plts, but these are improved today at 181.
   - Given results of B12, folate, Fe studies likely anemia of chronic
   disease d/t underlying COPD. HCT stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - No meds to suggest cause for decreased PLTs; stable since admission.
   Trend.
   - TSH normal.
   .
   # OSA.
   - CPAP at night once extubated.
   .
