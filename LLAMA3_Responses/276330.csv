   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.
   - Continue epogen
   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure. She was recently admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and developed left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 63 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 97/39 mmHg (56/81 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. She is receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, and her sedation is being weaned.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 23.4%
* Platelet count: 281 K/uL
* Creatinine: 6.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.9 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Altered mental status
* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Bandemia (left shift)
* Anemia
* Chronic renal failure

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and left shift suggest a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of further hypotension.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slow, and there is a risk of further bradycardia.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is chronic, and there is a risk of further anemia.
6. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure is likely to progress, and there is a risk of further complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is chronic, and there is a risk of further complications.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Weaning sedation and holding other sedating medications
* Continuing antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Weaning FiO2 and continuing mechanical ventilation
* Monitoring potassium and adjusting medications as necessary
* Continuing epogen and nephrocaps for anemia
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Continuing heparin gtt for potential line replacement
* Continuing levothyroxine for hypothyroidism

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.
   - Continue epogen
   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.
* She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia and was intubated in the emergency department (ED) for apnea and airway protection.
* The patient's current condition includes:
	+ Altered mental status, likely due to infection, hypothermia, hypotension, and medication effect.
	+ Respiratory failure, intubated in the ED for apnea and airway protection, with a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
	+ Hypotension, likely due to medication effect, with a recent increase in oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.
	+ Bradycardia, potentially related to metoprolol therapy and/or sinus node dysfunction.
	+ Chronic renal failure, secondary to ANCA vasculitis, with a decision to initiate hemodialysis (HD) last admission.
	+ Anemia, at baseline.
	+ Atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus bradycardia, on coumadin therapy.
	+ History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a bandemia and left shift, which may indicate a source of infection, potentially pulmonary or line-related.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray, which may represent a new process or incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which may lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia may be related to medication effect or sinus node dysfunction, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed with epogen therapy.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to her underlying conditions and immunosuppressive therapy.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan of care should focus on:

1. Managing the patient's altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension.
2. Treating the patient's sepsis and pneumonia with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
3. Monitoring the patient's cardiovascular stability and adjusting therapy as needed.
4. Managing the patient's chronic renal failure and anemia with HD and epogen therapy.
5. Preventing and treating potential complications, such as VAP and respiratory failure.
6. Providing supportive care, including tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.

   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.
   - Continue epogen
   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted to the hospital for acute on chronic renal failure and developed left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia. She was intubated in the emergency department for apnea and airway protection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: likely due to infection, hypothermia, hypotension, medication effect, and potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.
* Respiratory failure: intubated in the ED for apnea and airway protection, with a history of COPD and persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
* Hypotension: likely due to medication effect, with a possibility of sepsis.
* Bandemia/left shift: likely sources are pulmonary versus line infection, with urinalysis negative and no diarrhea to suggest C. difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
* Bradycardia: patient on metoprolol as an outpatient, with some component of sinus node dysfunction.
* Chronic renal failure: secondary to ANCA vasculitis, with a decision made to initiate hemodialysis last admission.
* Anemia: baseline mid-20s, with a plan to continue epogen.
* Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus bradycardia, on coumadin, with a plan to hold metoprolol for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for potential line replacement.
* History of transient ischemic attack: notes state the patient had a TIA which occurred when coumadin was held during a previous admission.
* Hypothyroidism: no acute issues, with a plan to continue levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: given the patient's altered mental status, bandemia, and hypotension, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and bradycardia increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: the patient's chronic renal failure and anemia increase the risk of developing acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
5. Infection: the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and catheters increase the risk of developing infection.
6. Bleeding: the patient's use of anticoagulant medications and presence of central lines and catheters increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: the patient's altered mental status and history of transient ischemic attack increase the risk of developing neurological complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize the risk of these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions.  History of
   COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with
   potential new pneumonia.
   - Patient comfortable on AC and will continue
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Levophed for systolic < 100
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD likely today
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s.  Drop from admission likely dilutional.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat in afternoon
   # Bradycardia: Improved - now heart rate in 60s-70s.  Patient on
   metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some component of sinus node
   dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia but will rule out.
   - Two sets of cardiac enzymes negative
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

Current Condition:

* The patient is a 91-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter placement.
* She is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray, which may represent new pneumonia or incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.
* The patient has altered mental status, likely due to infection, hypothermia, hypotension, and medication effect, and has a history of confusion with trazodone use.
* She has chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis, and her recent admission was complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to the persistent left lower lobe infiltrate and potential new pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen requirements and weaning of sedation are essential.
* Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and left shift may indicate a potential source of infection, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, and close monitoring of electrolyte levels and potential need for hemodialysis is essential.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to dilutional effects, and close monitoring of hematocrit levels and potential need for transfusion is necessary.
* Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, and close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and potential need for pacemaker insertion is necessary.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, and close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and potential need for anticoagulation therapy is necessary.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, and close monitoring of thyroid function tests and potential need for medication adjustment is necessary.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of COPD and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as C. difficile infection or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Catheter-related infections: The patient's use of tunnelled catheter and potential line infection may increase her risk of catheter-related infections, such as bacteremia or sepsis.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple potential complications to ensure optimal care and outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6837**]
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman with PMH COPD, Wegener's ,ESRD and recent Moroxella
   pneumonia. Presents with altered mental status and respiratory failure
   in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram negative rods growing
   on sputum culture. Altered mental status most likely [**2-3**] infection but
   could also be contribution from recent accidental overdose of
   trazodone. Vanc/zosyn for now.
   Unclear what the circumstances of intubation were but she has copious
   secretions now so likely premature to extubate. Wean fi02. Tolerating
   VC with little sedation so fine to stay with current settings. Mild
   hypotension likely secondary to decreased SVR in setting of infection.
   [**Month (only) 60**] need low dose levophed particulary with plans for HD today. Further
   plans as per resident
   note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman with PMH COPD, Wegener's ,ESRD and recent Moroxella
   pneumonia. Presents with altered mental status and respiratory failure
   in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram negative rods growing
   on sputum culture. Altered mental status most likely [**2-3**] infection but
   could also be contribution from recent accidental overdose of
   trazodone. Vanc/zosyn for now.
   Unclear what the circumstances of intubation were but she has copious
   secretions now so likely premature to extubate. Wean fi02. Tolerating
   VC with little sedation so fine to stay with current settings. Mild
   hypotension likely secondary to decreased SVR in setting of infection.
   [**Month (only) 60**] need low dose levophed particulary with plans for HD today. Further

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, ESRD, and recent Moraxella pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a diagnosis of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram-negative rods growing on sputum culture. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.7°F, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg.

The patient has a history of accidental overdose of trazodone, which may be contributing to her altered mental status. She is also receiving vanc/zosyn for her infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and gram-negative rods growing on sputum culture indicate a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
3. Infection-related complications: The patient's infection may lead to complications such as pneumonia, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of a neurological complication, such as encephalopathy or sepsis-induced encephalopathy, which can lead to long-term cognitive impairment or death.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mild hypotension may be a sign of decreased systemic vascular resistance, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.

To mitigate these complications, the patient should receive aggressive management of her infection, including antibiotics and source control. She should also receive close monitoring of her vital signs, respiratory status, and neurological function. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on her condition and treatment plan to ensure that they are aware of her needs and can provide optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 92-year-old woman with a history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was recently admitted with acute kidney injury (AoCRF) and was started on hemodialysis (HD). She was discharged on a course of cefpodoxime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and was prescribed oxygen therapy at home. Two days ago, she became lethargic and required increased oxygen, prompting her daughter to bring her to the emergency department (ED) due to concerns about her mental status. In the ED, she was intubated for apnea and had peri-intubation hypotension, which responded to levophed and has since been weaned off.

The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is receiving mechanical ventilation and is sedated. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg. She is receiving infusions of fentanyl and heparin, as well as other medications, including antibiotics and anticoagulants.

The patient's laboratory results show signs of infection, including a white blood cell count of 10.6 and a C-reactive protein level of 28.5. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.7 mmol/L and a phosphorus level of 6.9 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 21.9 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 6.3 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 202. Her chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low, indicating hypoxemia. She may require further adjustments to her ventilator settings or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level are elevated, indicating infection. She may require further antibiotics or antifungal therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the setting of infection. She may require further vasopressor support or fluid resuscitation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. She may require further hemodialysis or consideration of renal replacement therapy.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to infection, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. She may require further neurological evaluation or consultation with a neurologist.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are stable, but she may be at risk for cardiac complications due to her underlying cardiovascular disease and the use of vasopressors.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate gastrointestinal losses or malabsorption. She may require further evaluation or treatment for gastrointestinal complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 6908**]
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman with PMH COPD, Wegener's  (no current
   immunosuppresion) , ESRD, TIA, and recent Moroxella pneumonia, presents
   with altered mental status and respiratory failure due to probable
   pneumonia. This was in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram
   negative rods growing on sputum culture.
   Altered mental status most likely [**2-3**] infection but could also be
   contribution from recent accidental overdose of trazodone. Low level
   pressor requirement on sedation. ESRD on HD. Currently on vanc/zosyn.
   Acute respiratory failure appears to be improving. Will likely be able
   to extubate in AM.
   I updated patient
s daughter Sister [**Name (NI) **]. Rest of the plan as
   detailed above. Patient is critically ill. 30 minutes of critical care
   time spent with patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: f/u nutrition recs for TFs while intubated.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 6908**]
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman with PMH COPD, Wegener's  (no current
   immunosuppresion) , ESRD, TIA, and recent Moroxella pneumonia, presents
   with altered mental status and respiratory failure due to probable
   pneumonia. This was in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram
   negative rods growing on sputum culture.
   Altered mental status most likely [**2-3**] infection but could also be
   contribution from recent accidental overdose of trazodone. Low level
   pressor requirement on sedation. ESRD on HD. Currently on vanc/zosyn.
   Acute respiratory failure appears to be improving. Will likely be able
   to extubate in AM.
   I updated patient
s daughter Sister [**Name (NI) **]. Rest of the plan as
   detailed above. Patient is critically ill. 30 minutes of critical care
   time spent with patient.

   [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions.  History of
   COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with
   potential new pneumonia.
   - Patient comfortable on AC and will continue
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Levophed for systolic < 100
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,

   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure. She is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a history of altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 103/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a sinus rhythm and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 249 K/uL. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.

The patient is receiving treatment for suspected pulmonary and potential line infection with vancomycin and Zosyn. She is also receiving combivent inhalers and albuterol as needed. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: Intubated for apnea of unclear etiology and airway protection.
2. Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect, but sepsis is less likely.
3. Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line infection.
4. Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis, with a decision to initiate hemodialysis.
5. Anemia: Baseline mid-20s, with a drop from admission likely due to dilutional anemia.
6. Bradycardia: Improved, but patient is on metoprolol as an outpatient, which may be contributing to the bradycardia.
7. Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia, on coumadin, but holding metoprolol for now.
8. History of transient ischemic attack: Patient had a TIA when coumadin was held during a previous admission.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and left shift may indicate a potential source of sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory failure and lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray may indicate a new pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory failure and lead to sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet count may indicate a risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or heart failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of transient ischemic attack may indicate a risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help you with that! However, I need to clarify that the text you provided appears to be a large block of code, which makes it difficult for me to analyze and summarize the medical information.

Could you please provide more context or information about what this code represents? Is it a patient's medical record, a clinical note, or something else? Additionally, are there any specific areas of the code you would like me to focus on or extract information from?

Once I have a better understanding of what this code represents, I'll do my best to help you summarize the medical information and identify any potential medical complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

   Disposition:  ICU given intubated and remains on pressors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with a past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. She was recently readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, likely due to infection, and was found to have a pulmonary source of infection, including Moraxella pneumonia.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%. She is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and her blood and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, a heart rate of 70 bpm, and a blood pressure of 103/46 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 inspirations per minute, and her SpO2 is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 249 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.5 mg/dL, a sodium level of 141 mEq/L, and a chloride level of 103 mEq/L.

The patient's medical conditions include chronic renal failure, anemia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She is receiving treatment for these conditions, including hemodialysis, epogen, and levothyroxine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, and her blood and sputum cultures are pending.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for hypotension due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of pressors.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she is at risk for anemia due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of epogen.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is normal, but she is at risk for bradycardia due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of metoprolol.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm, but she is at risk for atrial fibrillation due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of heparin.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage her condition and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old woman with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with altered mental status and respiratory failure, and has been diagnosed with probable new pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status
* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Hypotension, possibly related to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the setting of infection
* Decreased cardiac output, with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 106/45 mmHg
* Fever, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 10.6 x 10^9/L
* Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL
* Elevated creatinine levels, with a value of 6.3 mg/dL
* Elevated lactate levels, with a value of 0.9 mmol/L
* Hypocalcemia, with a calcium level of 7.5 mg/dL
* Hypomagnesemia, with a magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL
* Hypophosphatemia, with a phosphate level of 3.7 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and has received mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to support her blood pressure.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if she does not respond to treatment, and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest that she may have sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest that she may be at risk for renal failure, which can further complicate her clinical course.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output suggest that she may be at risk for cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or other serious complications.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure suggest that she may be at risk for neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage her respiratory failure, sepsis, and other complications."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

Summary:

The patient is a 92-year-old female with a past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. She was readmitted with altered mental status, which has improved significantly since her admission. She is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure and is receiving treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Her medical conditions include hypotension, coagulopathy, bandemia, anemia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure if her treatment plan is not effective.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and chronic renal failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she is at risk of bleeding if her coagulation status is not carefully monitored and managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and she is at risk of developing further hypotension, particularly in the setting of sepsis and chronic renal failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic renal failure, and she is at risk of developing further anemia if her treatment plan is not effective.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely due to her underlying medical conditions, and she is at risk of developing further bradycardia if her treatment plan is not effective.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely due to her underlying medical conditions, and she is at risk of developing further atrial fibrillation if her treatment plan is not effective.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is likely due to her underlying medical conditions, and she is at risk of developing further hypothyroidism if her treatment plan is not effective.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's bradycardia closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hypothyroidism closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
8. Consider referring the patient to a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or a nephrologist, for further management of her underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient has undergone various interventions, including angiography, PICC line placement, and extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 151/47 mmHg and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and creatinine levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and kidney dysfunction. The patient's troponin levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to assess certain vital signs. The patient's skin, peripheral vascular, and neurologic examinations are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia diagnosis and ongoing inflammation increase the risk of pneumonia progression and potential sepsis.
2. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic renal failure and elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure exacerbation and potential acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's slightly elevated troponin levels and ongoing inflammation increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension increases the risk of organ dysfunction and potential cardiac arrest.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly low potassium level increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and inability to assess certain vital signs increase the risk of infection and potential sepsis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and potential respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: f/u nutrition recs for TFs while intubated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:  ICU given intubated and remains on pressors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic renal failure and was initiated on hemodialysis (HD) during her previous admission. She was readmitted with altered mental status and was found to have a pulmonary source of infection, likely Moraxella pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Cardiovascular: She is receiving levophed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg. Her heart rate is 70 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 151/47 mmHg.
* Neurological: Her mental status has improved significantly, and she is alert and following commands.
* Hematological: Her platelet count is 73,000/μL, and her hemoglobin is 7.3 g/dL.
* Renal: She is receiving HD three times a week, and her creatinine level is 6.3 mg/dL.
* Coagulation: Her international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic, and she is receiving heparin gtt.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary source of infection may lead to pneumonia, which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and bandemia may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of TIA may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen her cardiovascular status and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, particularly if her pneumonia is not effectively treated.
6. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, particularly if her HD is not effective in controlling her electrolyte imbalances.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, particularly if her epogen therapy is not effective in controlling her hemoglobin levels.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and treatment for her pneumonia, sepsis, coagulopathy, hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure, and anemia."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since significantly lessened.  Successfully extubated on
   [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2 via NC without e/o respiratory
   distress.  Sputum culture from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no
   other new organisms.  Still with same infiltrate on chest imaging so ?
   inadequately treated previously with cefpodoxime (although should be
   sensitive and responsive to this) vs. consideration of colonization or
   endobronchial lesion with postobstructive pneumonia.  Not bronched
   while intubated to eval this further.
   -d/c vanco/zosyn as culture showing moraxella only
   -starting ceftriaxone as moraxella should be sensitive
   -will need repeat imaging as outpatient to assess for resolution of
   infiltrate as if persists despite appropriate rx, may need to pursue
   further eval with bronch to r/o endobronchial lesion
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved following extubation and
   intermittently confused although alert and oriented to person, place,
   time as [**Month (only) 102**] (not year).  Likely delirium in the setting of
   infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of advanced
   age.   Was worse on presentation also after having taken unclear amount
   of trazadone.  CT head on presentation without acute process.  TSH,
   B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   - starting ctx for moraxella
   - limit sedating meds
   - frequent reorientation
   # Hypotension:  Currently normotensive off pressors.  Was worse in the
   setting of HD, however tolerated HD better yesterday and has been off
   levophed.   Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - off levophed
   - Hold metoprolol for now, but can restart  pending stability in BPs
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency,
   but also in the setting of antibiotic effect.  No signs of active
   bleeding.  Does have h/o TIA in setting of a.fib and subtherapeutic INR
   so would be less inclined to reverse at this time.
   - continue off heparin and coumadin
   - continue to monitor coags and consider vit K if continues to rise
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD; will not get on [**12-27**], but will then resume on Friday
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.  Has been slightly lower than most
   recent baseline in the low 20s, but stable there x >24h.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - pm hct
   # Bradycardia:  Resolved and currently normal rate.  Patient on
   metoprolol as an outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of recent hypotension although can
   likely restart pending stability in BP
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so holding
   heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now as above
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and developed respiratory failure, which required intubation. She was recently extubated and is currently on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and developed respiratory failure, which required intubation. She was successfully extubated, but she may still require oxygen therapy. The patient's chest imaging shows an infiltrate, which may indicate a respiratory infection.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has been intermittently confused and disoriented, which may be due to infection, sedating medications, or ICU stay. She has a history of delirium and may require further evaluation and management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and she has required pressors in the past. She is currently off pressors, but her blood pressure may still be at risk for instability.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, which may be due to nutritional deficiency or antibiotic effect. She has a history of TIA and may require further evaluation and management.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which requires ongoing management and monitoring.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may require further evaluation and management.
9. History of transient ischemic attack: The patient has a history of TIA, which may require further evaluation and management.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue HD and monitor potassium levels.
2. Continue epogen and transfuse for hematocrit < 21.
3. Continue PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Monitor and manage respiratory status, including oxygen therapy and chest imaging.
5. Monitor and manage altered mental status, including frequent reorientation and sedation management.
6. Monitor and manage hypotension, including blood pressure monitoring and pressor management.
7. Monitor and manage coagulopathy, including INR monitoring and vitamin K therapy.
8. Monitor and manage chronic renal failure, including HD and electrolyte management.
9. Monitor and manage anemia, including epogen and transfusion management.
10. Monitor and manage bradycardia, including heart rate monitoring and medication management.
11. Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation, including heart rate monitoring and anticoagulation management.
12. Monitor and manage history of transient ischemic attack, including INR monitoring and anticoagulation management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia. She has undergone various interventions, including angiotherapy, placement of a PICC line, and extubation.

Physiological parameters:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.6°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 67 bpm, BP 149/43 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving fluid support, with a total fluid input of 792 mL and output of 3,015 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 40%.

Laboratory results:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 10.6, Hct 23.4, Plt 73.
* Blood chemistry: Cr 6.3, TropT 0.03, TCO2 23, Glucose 101.
* Coagulation profile: INR 5.3, PT 47.3, PTT 65.1.
* Electrolytes: Na 139, K 4.5, Cl 102, Ca++ 8.0, Mg++ 2.0, PO4 5.0.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient is expected to undergo follow-up imaging to ensure resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
* Antibiotics will be narrowed to levofloxacin.
* The patient's elevated INR is being monitored, and further plans for dialysis will be determined by the renal team.
* The patient is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise or failure.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress or sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, leading to further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalance, or need for dialysis.
* Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of anticoagulation therapy.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's advanced age, hypertension, and tachycardia may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability or cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old woman who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 149/43 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination is notable for bronchial breath sounds on the left base, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her extremities are edematous, and her skin is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 73,000/μL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of allergies to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amiodarone, quinine, codeine, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's current medications include levofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Sepsis
3. Respiratory failure
4. Cardiac arrhythmias
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding
6. Renal failure
7. Wound infection
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
9. Pulmonary embolism
10. Sternal wound infection

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that she be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration and that her antibiotics be narrowed to just levofloxacin. Further imaging studies may be necessary to ensure resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient should be evaluated for a diet and should continue to receive regular insulin sliding scale."
