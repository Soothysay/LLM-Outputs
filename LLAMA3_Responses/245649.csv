   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]
   # DISPO: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14262**] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   He is
   hypotensive but mentating well.
   Medical Decision Making
   After extensive discussion with the family and the patient, he will be
   made DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within

   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased

   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14262**] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   He is
   hypotensive but mentating well.
   Medical Decision Making
   After extensive discussion with the family and the patient, he will be
   made DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**], MD
   on:[**2120-2-22**] 20:41 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted. His hypotension is likely caused by amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium, as well as worsened cardiac function in the context of fluid overload. He has a history of poor PO intake and is very thirsty, suggesting a component of hypovolemia (intravascular depletion). The patient's EKG does not show evidence of new ischemia, and he denies chest pain.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his chronic kidney disease, poor perfusion, and amyloid disease. His current Cr is 4.4, which is elevated from his baseline Cr of 2.5-2.9. The patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to his hypotension, and therefore, IV fluids should be used judiciously.

The patient's amyloidosis is likely causing cardiac and renal involvement, and he has a poor prognosis. He has a monoclonal Ig spike, which suggests the possibility of plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient's family has been informed of his poor prognosis, and he is asking to be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible.

The patient's atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block are likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and conduction system. Given his multiple comorbidities, anticoagulation is not recommended.

The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure is likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. He would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during his recent hospital stay.

The patient's other comorbidities include COPD, iron deficiency anemia, dyslipidemia, and a history of alcohol abuse. He is currently on pressors and is at risk for central access if he is unable to wean them.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's amyloidosis is likely causing cardiac involvement, which can lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his chronic kidney disease, poor perfusion, and amyloid disease. He is at risk for ATN and chronic kidney disease.
3. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state makes him susceptible to infections, which can be life-threatening.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor PO intake and anemia may lead to malnutrition and further compromise his immune function.
6. Psychological complications: The patient's poor prognosis and complex medical condition may lead to depression, anxiety, and other psychological complications.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and he requires careful management to prevent potential medical complications."

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a complex medical history, including diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

The patient's cardiac condition is characterized by mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction, vasodilatory hypotension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and elevated cardiac output/index. The patient's EKG shows AFib with a rate in the 90s, and the 2D-echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a current creatinine level of 4.2 and a baseline creatinine level of 2.5-2.9. The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure, and the possibility of plasma cell dyscrasia is being considered.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with no evidence of increased intracranial pressure or cerebral edema.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, including troponin-T, and anemia. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild elevation in potassium.

The patient's medical plan includes judicious IV fluid boluses as needed, continuation of norepinephrine infusion, and close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prophylaxis measures are being taken.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's cardiac condition, including diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure may occur.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease put him at risk for further renal decline, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, and end-stage renal disease.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make him prone to respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalance may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and cerebral edema.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and central venous catheters increase his risk of infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and platelet dysfunction may increase his risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's DVT prophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy may not be sufficient to prevent thromboembolic complications such as PE, DVT, and pulmonary artery thrombosis.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his medical plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele

   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from

   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a complex medical history, including diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of diastolic heart failure and amyloidosis, cardiogenic shock is a possibility, especially if the patient experiences a new insult or worsened cardiac function.
2. Renal failure: The patient's current creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL is concerning, and further deterioration of renal function is possible if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: Despite the patient's lack of fever, leukocytosis, or symptoms suggestive of infection, the possibility of infection cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's immunocompromised state.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's poor oral intake and thirst may indicate hypovolemia, which could exacerbate his hypotension and renal failure.
5. Amyloidosis progression: The patient's amyloidosis is likely to progress, which may lead to further cardiac and renal dysfunction.
6. Plasma cell dyscrasia: The patient's monoclonal Ig spike and suspected plasma cell dyscrasia may indicate a poor prognosis and increased risk of complications.
7. Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block: The patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and block may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
8. COPD exacerbation: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to respiratory failure.
9. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to anemia and further complications.
10. Dyslipidemia: The patient's dyslipidemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not managed appropriately.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. The physician's plan includes judicious use of IV fluids, continued norepinephrine infusion, and monitoring of urine and blood cultures. The patient's family has been informed of his poor prognosis, and a meeting has been scheduled to discuss his condition and treatment options."

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic heart failure, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. His EKG shows atrial fibrillation, and his 2D-echocardiogram reveals mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a large left pleural effusion. He has a soft tissue biopsy showing amyloid deposition. His current medications include norepinephrine, dobutamine, and levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Hypotension: due to amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium, worsened cardiac function, and fluid overload.
	* Atrial fibrillation: may lead to stroke, thromboembolism, and cardiac arrhythmias.
	* Diastolic heart failure: may worsen with amyloid infiltration and fluid overload.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure: may progress to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
	* Chronic kidney disease: may worsen with amyloid infiltration and hypertension.
3. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Pulmonary hypertension: may worsen with amyloid infiltration and fluid overload.
	* Respiratory failure: may occur with worsening pulmonary hypertension and fluid overload.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Urinary tract infection: may occur with urinary catheterization and bladder distension.
	* Bloodstream infection: may occur with central line placement and bacteremia.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: may occur with amyloid infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract and stress ulceration.
	* Malnutrition: may occur with poor appetite, dysphagia, and malabsorption.
6. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures: may occur with electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and cerebral edema.
	* Cerebral edema: may occur with amyloid infiltration of the brain and fluid overload.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient's care should be coordinated with his primary care physician, cardiologist, nephrologist, and other specialists as needed."

   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Heart failure, intravascular depletion and tissue edema. Has been
   worsening on one pressor
 vasopressin 2.4 overnight. Attempted
   norepinephrine, but patient became tachycardic.
   - Augement peripheral pressors
 increase midodrine to 15 mg TID and
   start phenylephrine
 watch for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Now intravascularly depleted while very volume overloaded. Failure
   worsens as patient has become anuric. Attributed to amyloid or plasma
   cell dyscrasia.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible. In
   conjunction with family, goals may change today
   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has been intermittently in AF, as per previous admissions.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Is anuric and not a candidate for dialysis given prognosis.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 67/38 mmHg. He is receiving vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units per hour to support his blood pressure.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of volume overload, including bilateral pedal edema and jugular venous distension. He also has a temporal wasting, and his sclera are anicteric. His respiratory examination is significant for poor air movement at the bases with diffuse lower crackles.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1, hemoglobin of 28.3, and platelet count of 257. His creatinine level is 4.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen level is 19 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.50 ng/mL, and his lactic acid level is 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, amyloidosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also has a history of alcohol abuse and iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure is worsening, and he is at risk for further cardiac decompensation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to amyloidosis or plasma cell dyscrasia, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload is likely contributing to his hypotension and cardiac failure.
4. Infection: The patient's poor immune function and volume overload make him at risk for infection.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, and he is at risk for further arrhythmias.
6. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia is a concern, and he may require further treatment.
7. Dyslipidemia: The patient's dyslipidemia is a concern, and he may require further treatment.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Augmentation of peripheral pressors: The patient's vasopressor dose will be increased to 15 mg tid, and phenylephrine will be started to support his blood pressure.
2. Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of cardiac failure, renal failure, and volume overload.
3. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will receive antibiotic therapy for any suspected infections.
4. Anti-arrhythmic therapy: The patient will receive anti-arrhythmic therapy to control his atrial fibrillation.
5. Anemia treatment: The patient will receive treatment for his iron deficiency anemia.
6. Dyslipidemia treatment: The patient will stop his statin therapy due to his dyslipidemia.

The patient's goals of care include:

1. To improve his cardiac function and reduce his risk of cardiac failure.
2. To improve his renal function and reduce his risk of renal failure.
3. To reduce his volume overload and improve his respiratory function.
4. To prevent infections and control his atrial fibrillation.
5. To treat his anemia and dyslipidemia.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he has requested palliative care consult and to return home with consideration of home hospice."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Heart failure, intravascular depletion and tissue edema. Has been
   worsening on one pressor
 vasopressin 2.4 overnight. Attempted
   norepinephrine, but patient became tachycardic.
   - Augement peripheral pressors
 increase midodrine to 15 mg TID and
   start phenylephrine
 watch for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Now intravascularly depleted while very volume overloaded. Failure
   worsens as patient has become anuric. Attributed to amyloid or plasma
   cell dyscrasia.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible. In
   conjunction with family, goals may change today
   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has been intermittently in AF, as per previous admissions.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Is anuric and not a candidate for dialysis given prognosis.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. He has been weaned off norepinephrine and started on vasopressin, but his condition continues to deteriorate. He has been declared DNR/DNI, and his family is seeking palliative care and possible home hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued hypotension and worsening cardiac output due to amyloidosis and refractory edema.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease progression, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
3. Complications from amyloidosis, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy.
4. Potential plasma cell dyscrasia, which may worsen the patient's condition and prognosis.
5. Respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and volume overload.
6. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to amyloidosis and refractory edema.
8. Nutritional deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia, due to malabsorption and chronic illness.
9. Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypocalcemia, due to amyloidosis and chronic kidney disease.
10. Potential for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, due to underlying cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Felt to be due to autonomic dysfunction and inappropriate
   vasodilation.  Note that he often had episodes of hypotension with SBPs
   in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He endorses poor PO intake
   and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there may be a component of
   hypovolemia.  No fevers, leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an
   infection.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely unless he suffered new insult,
   and although his troponin is elevated, this is in the setting of
   worsening renal failure.  His EKG does not show evidence of new
   ischemia and he denies chest pain.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - wean norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease:  current Cr 4.2,
   baseline Cr 2.5-2.9:
   Likely due to poor renal perfusion in setting of hypotension
   superimposed on progressively worsening renal dysfunction that has been
   attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - will contact renal in AM for assistance with spinning urine
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **]/Onc in AM regarding possibility of inpatient BM
   biopsy
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear upon review of discharge summary if
   team was aware that he had been in AFib during recent hospital stay.
   CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to be counted.  Given
   his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate
   significant diuresis during recent hospital stay.  Will manage volume
   as needed to support his blood pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Felt to be due to autonomic dysfunction and inappropriate
   vasodilation.  Note that he often had episodes of hypotension with SBPs
   in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He endorses poor PO intake
   and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there may be a component of
   hypovolemia.  No fevers, leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an
   infection.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely unless he suffered new insult,
   and although his troponin is elevated, this is in the setting of
   worsening renal failure.  His EKG does not show evidence of new
   ischemia and he denies chest pain.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - wean norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease:  current Cr 4.2,
   baseline Cr 2.5-2.9:
   Likely due to poor renal perfusion in setting of hypotension
   superimposed on progressively worsening renal dysfunction that has been
   attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - will contact renal in AM for assistance with spinning urine
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **]/Onc in AM regarding possibility of inpatient BM
   biopsy
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear upon review of discharge summary if
   team was aware that he had been in AFib during recent hospital stay.
   CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to be counted.  Given
   his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate
   significant diuresis during recent hospital stay.  Will manage volume
   as needed to support his blood pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, poor PO intake, and high creatinine levels, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, with an elevated troponin level and a history of atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or cardiac failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to poor renal perfusion in the setting of hypotension, and there is a risk of further renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's volume overload can lead to further complications, such as pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and increased risk of infection.
5. Infection: The patient's poor immune function and recent hospitalization increase the risk of developing an infection, which can be life-threatening.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's poor PO intake and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration, bleeding, or obstruction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of neurological symptoms and elevated troponin level increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and history of respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or exacerbation of COPD.
9. Hematological complications: The patient's history of iron deficiency anemia and monoclonal Ig spike increase the risk of hematological complications, such as bleeding, anemia, or bone marrow failure.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for several potential medical complications, including sepsis, cardiac complications, renal failure, fluid overload, infection, gastrointestinal complications, neurological complications, respiratory complications, and hematological complications. Close monitoring and management of these potential complications are essential to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and acute renal failure. They are receiving vasopressin and heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 34.5°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 53/27 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 92%. The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 53/27 mmHg, which is concerning for hypotension. This may be exacerbated by the patient's atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 6.1 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. This may be a sign of inadequate perfusion or nephrotoxicity.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 82 mg/dL, which is low. This may be a sign of inadequate glucose control or pancreatitis.
4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which may be contributing to their hypotension and arrhythmias.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be a sign of cardiac compromise, and the patient's hypotension may be exacerbating this condition.
6. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, which may indicate an underlying infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated liver enzyme level, which may indicate liver damage or pancreatitis.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's SpO2 is 92%, which may indicate respiratory compromise or chronic lung disease.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and acute renal failure. They also require further evaluation and management of their cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms."
