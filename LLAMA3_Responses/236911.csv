You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes, who presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, and elevated lithium levels. He was intubated and sedated due to myoclonic twitching and tremors. His laboratory results show signs of lithium toxicity, including nausea, hypotension, and tremors. His lithium level decreased after continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) but is expected to rebound due to ion redistribution. He will require multiple hemodialysis sessions to clear the lithium. His other laboratory results show signs of acute renal failure, including elevated creatinine and urea levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebound lithium toxicity: The patient's lithium level is expected to rebound after CVVH, which may lead to further complications.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's lithium toxicity may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's intubation and sedation may increase his risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheters may increase his risk of developing DVT.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may lead to stress ulceration, which can cause bleeding and other complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and drink may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen his overall health.
8. Psychological complications: The patient's schizophrenia and lithium toxicity may lead to psychological complications, such as agitation, hallucinations, and delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to poisoning/overdose and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 20, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 19 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple lines and catheters, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory rate may not be adequate to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, particularly the potassium level, may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding: The patient's multiple lines and catheters may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection, particularly VAP.

The patient's code status is unknown, and the disposition is unclear. Further evaluation and management are needed to address the patient's underlying condition and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Blood culture: Pending
* Urine culture: Pending
* Sputum culture: >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, with multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Poisoning/overdose, other
* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Enteral nutrition
* Glycemic control: Insulin infusion
* Lines: Multi-lumen, 18-gauge, and dialysis catheter
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia or aspiration due to the patient's respiratory failure
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's acute renal failure and multiple organisms in the sputum culture
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's poisoning/overdose and cardiac toxicity
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and risk factors for venous thromboembolism."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin this morning for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If
   cultures negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday during HD, but off
   since yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch if overdose could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and lithium toxicity. The patient was admitted to the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Lithium toxicity: The patient's lithium level was elevated at 0.7 and 0.8, and he was treated with prolonged HD to clear lithium. The patient's lithium levels trended down to within normal limits, and he was monitored for signs of lithium toxicity.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function improved after HD, and the diagnosis was likely prerenal volume depletion and perfusion-related kidney injury.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature was elevated at 100.6, and a CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity, potentially PNA. Cultures were obtained, and empiric vanco and cefepime were started for VAP.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's symptoms were likely due to lithium toxicity or gastroenteritis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium toxicity.
6. Schizophrenia: The patient's lithium toxicity was likely secondary to ARF and not purposeful overdose.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes was managed with insulin sliding scale, and metformin was held.
8. Urinary incontinence: The patient's detrol was held while he was hypotensive.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's Lipitor was held until LFTs normalized.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 87 bpm
* Blood pressure: 98/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* CVP: 12 mmHg

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Renal U/S: No evidence of stones, masses, or hydronephrosis.
* CXR: Retrocardiac opacity with airbronchograms, potentially PNA.

The patient's medications include:

* Fentanyl: 25 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed): 1.5 mg/hour
* Famotidine (Pepcid): [**2166-1-22**] 08:00 AM
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis): [**2166-1-22**] 11:30 PM
* Other medications: Insulin sliding scale, ciprofloxacin, vanco and cefepime.

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity
* Continuing to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity
* Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
* Trending lytes, lithium level, and creatinine closely
* Holding all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
* Empiric vanco and cefepime for VAP
* Daily CXR
* Monitoring for symptoms of gastroenteritis or lithium toxicity
* Holding outpt BP meds, detrol
* Discussing with outpatient psych if overdose could have been purposeful
* Holding Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and psych
* Restarting Clozaril when possible
* Holding metformin
* Insulin sliding scale when in house
* Holding detrol while hypotensive
* Restarting Lipitor when LFTs normalize

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Rebound lithium toxicity
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Pneumonia
* Gastroenteritis
* Hypoglycemia
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypophosphatemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hyperlipidemia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions pending trend of lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE
   - Send urine lytes, urine eosinophils
   - Renal U/S in am to r/o obstruction
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms once lithium dialysised
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday, but off since
   yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch with could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Lipitor until normal LFTs confirmed.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: IJ, HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: none - no contact per psych facility

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and lithium toxicity.
* He has undergone hemodialysis (HD) and his lithium levels have trended down to within normal limits.
* He is currently on ventilatory support with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* He has a fever of 100.6°F (38.1°C) and a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, which may be due to pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's ARF is likely due to prerenal volume depletion and lithium nephritis. Further HD sessions may be necessary to manage his renal function.
2. **Lithium Toxicity:** The patient's lithium levels have trended down, but he may still be at risk for rebound toxicity as intra/extracellular levels equilibrate. Monitoring of lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension) is essential.
3. **Fever and Infection:** The patient's fever may be due to pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and cultures of blood, urine, and sputum are pending.
4. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be due to volume depletion and lithium toxicity. Monitoring of blood pressure and repletion of volume as needed are essential.
5. **Nausea and Vomiting:** The patient's symptoms may be due to gastroenteritis or lithium toxicity. Monitoring of symptoms and repletion of volume as needed are essential.
6. **Diabetes:** The patient's diabetes is likely to be managed with insulin sliding scale while he is in the hospital.
7. **Schizophrenia:** The patient's schizophrenia may be exacerbated by lithium toxicity. Discussion with outpatient psychiatry and pharmacy is necessary to determine whether to restart Clozaril, Benztropine, and Haldol.

**ICU Care:**

* Nutrition: The patient is NPO, and his nutritional needs will be managed with enteral nutrition.
* Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale.
* Lines: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen catheter, an 18-gauge catheter, a dialysis catheter, and an arterial line.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
* Disposition: The patient is currently in the ICU and will be monitored closely for clinical improvement before being discharged to a regular ward."

   Assessment and Plan 43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who
   presents with hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity . # Lithium
   toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance. Levels
   trended down to within normal limits x 2. - Monitor for signs of
   lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hypotension -
   Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **] - Monitor serum sodium, for DI - Continue IVF per Toxicology
   recommendations (consider decreasing rate to 150cc/hr given ?mild
   volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re: during of IVF fluids #
   Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy. - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
   (checking [**Hospital1 **], have been stable 0.8-0.9) - Trend lytes, lithium level
   and creatinine closely - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds) . # Fever:
   Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity,
   potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given GI
   symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning - Culture blood, urine, sputum;
   follow-up outstanding cultures - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 =
   [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas
   coverage. If cultures negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage. - Daily
   CXR - . # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium
   toxicity. - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed - Replete volume
   as needed . # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion
   and lithium toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during
   HD, but off over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable. - Monitor
   BP - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol ( may consider restarting later today
   in setting of stable renal function . # Schizophrenia: Most likely
   lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not purposeful overdose. - Hold
   Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch base with
   them early this morning as paable renal functionte to 150cc/hr given
   ?mild volume overload overnight) - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely
   restart Clozaril . # Diabetes: Hold metformin. - Insulin sliding scale
   when in house. . # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   . # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate
   - further HD per serial lithium levels
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin this morning for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If
   cultures negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine yesterday during HD, but off
   since yesterday evening.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Discuss with outpatient pysch if overdose could have been purposeful
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol until discuss with pharm and pysch
   whether can re-start
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Left IJ, R IJ HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)
   # Code:  Full - presumed.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. He was treated with hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and his lithium levels trended down to normal. The patient is currently extubated and receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. He has a history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be related to lithium toxicity or gastroenteritis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Lithium toxicity:** The patient's lithium levels are being closely monitored, and further HD sessions may be necessary to manage rebound toxicity. The patient's serum sodium levels should also be monitored for diabetes insipidus (DI).
2. **Acute renal failure:** The patient's renal function has improved since HD, but further HD sessions may be necessary to manage lithium levels. The patient's urine output should be closely monitored, and electrolytes should be repleted as needed.
3. **Fever:** The patient's temperature has been elevated, and cultures are pending. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
4. **Nausea and vomiting:** The patient's symptoms may be related to lithium toxicity or gastroenteritis. Repletion of volume as needed and monitoring of symptoms are necessary.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be related to volume depletion and lithium toxicity. Phenylephrine was used temporarily during HD, but it is currently being held.
6. **Schizophrenia:** The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and discussions with outpatient psychiatry should occur regarding potential overdose.
7. **Diabetes:** The patient's diabetes should be managed with insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
8. **Urinary incontinence:** The patient's detrol should be held while hypotensive.
9. **Hyperlipidemia:** The patient's lipitor should be held until liver function tests (LFTs) are normal.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's lithium levels and adjust HD sessions as necessary.
2. Replete volume as needed to manage nausea and vomiting.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
4. Continue empiric antibiotics until cultures are negative.
5. Discuss potential overdose with outpatient psychiatry.
6. Manage the patient's diabetes with insulin sliding scale.
7. Hold detrol until hypotension resolves.
8. Hold lipitor until LFTs are normal.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   -
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during HD, but off
   over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
 may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them early this morning as paable renal functionte to
   150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: Left IJ, R IJ HD line, radial a-line, PIV x2
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. The patient was extubated today and is being treated for lithium toxicity, ARF, and potential pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/70 mmHg. The patient is tachypneic, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 300 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride level of 112 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a chest X-ray with a slightly impinging left tracheal wall and bibasal atelectasis, but no appreciable pleural effusion or masses.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension
* Continuing to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity
* Monitoring serum sodium levels for diabetes insipidus
* Continuing IV fluids at a rate of 150 cc/hr given mild volume overload overnight
* Holding all diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and home medications
* Trending lytes, lithium levels, and creatinine closely
* Considering further hemodialysis sessions as needed

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Lithium toxicity, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension
* Acute renal failure, which can cause electrolyte imbalances and require further hemodialysis sessions
* Pneumonia, which can cause respiratory distress and require antibiotic therapy
* Gastroenteritis, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
* Hypotension, which can cause decreased perfusion and organ dysfunction
* Hyperlipidemia, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and promote recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: Levels persistently within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels QD
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD, with renal function significantly
   improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted in acute renal
   failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis. FeNa 1.3% FeUrea
   24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w ATN, no
   eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive uropathy.
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   - D/c HD line
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity. Would also
   have to consider pancreatitis, biliary pathology, MI.
   - EKG, CEs
   - Belly labs
   - Replete volume as needed
   - rectal exam
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol -- may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them
   - Follow up on Psych recs: restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.
   .
   # FEN: electrolytes repletion per renal, NPO, IVF for hydration
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x2, we can pull the HD line now
   # Communication: Family (contact information on white board in room)
   # Code:  Full - presumed.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a complex medical history, including schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes, who presents with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. The patient's condition is critical, and multiple potential medical complications are present.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute (insp/min), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological examination reveals decreased responsiveness, with no clear evidence of focal neurological deficits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.19 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 135 mmol/L, potassium level is 4.4 mmol/L, and chloride level is 115 mmol/L.
* Blood cultures: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for bacteremia.
* Urinalysis: The patient's urinalysis is pending, but the patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) and is at risk for further complications.
* Imaging: The patient's chest X-ray is pending, but the patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further respiratory complications.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Lithium toxicity: The patient's lithium levels are within normal limits, but the patient is at risk for further toxicity due to ongoing renal failure and volume depletion.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is significantly impaired, and the patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis and electrolyte imbalances.
* Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated at 100.6°F (38.1°C), and the patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis.
* Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely related to lithium toxicity, gastroenteritis, or pancreatitis.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient is at risk for further hypotension due to ongoing volume depletion and lithium toxicity.
* Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is likely exacerbated by lithium toxicity and acute renal failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension.
* Continuing to follow lithium levels daily.
* Monitoring serum sodium levels for diabetes insipidus.
* Holding all diuretics and ACE inhibitors.
* Discontinuing hemodialysis (HD) line.
* Empiric vancomycin and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Daily chest X-ray.
* Electrolyte repletion as needed.
* Repleting volume as needed.
* Rectal exam.
* Holding Clozaril, Benztropine, and Haldol per psychiatric recommendations.
* Restarting Clozaril when possible.
* Holding metformin.
* Insulin sliding scale when in house.
* Holding detrol while hypotensive.
* Holding Lipitor until liver function tests (LFTs) are normal.

The patient's disposition is uncertain at this time, and the patient will require further evaluation and treatment to address the multiple medical complications present."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during HD, but off
   over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
 may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them early this morning as paable renal functionte to
   150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year old male with schizophrenia, HTN, DM who presents with
   hypotension, ARF and lithium toxicity
   .
   # Lithium toxicity: S/p prolonged HD yesterday for lithium clearance.
   Levels trended down to within normal limits x 2.
   - Monitor for signs of lithium toxicity including nausea, vomiting,
   diarrhea and hypotension
   - Continue to follow lithium levels to monitor for rebound toxicity as
   intra/extracellular levels equilibrate but will decrease frequency to
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Monitor serum sodium, for DI
   - Continue IVF per Toxicology recommendations (consider decreasing rate
   to 150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
 will ask Tox re:
   duration of IVF fluids
   # Acute renal failure: S/p HD yesterday, with renal function
   significantly improved. Most likely prerenal volume depletion resulted
   in acute renal failure and predisposed patient to lithium nephritis.
   FeNa 1.3% FeUrea 24%, c/w perfusion-related kidney injury. U/A not c/w
   ATN, no eosinophils to suggest AIN. U/S negative for obstructive
   uropathy.
   - Further HD sessions PRN depending on lithium levels (checking [**Hospital1 **],
   have been stable 0.8-0.9)
   - Trend lytes, lithium level and creatinine closely
   - Hold all diuretics, ACE (home meds)
   .
   # Fever: Temp to 100.6 overnight. CXR concerning for retrocardiac
   opacity, potentially PNA. Also concern for ongoing viral process given
   GI symptoms. New leukocytosis this morning
   - Culture blood, urine, sputum; follow-up outstanding cultures
   - Empiric vanco & cefepime (day 1 = [**1-23**]) for VAP
 started
   Ciprofloxacin ysterday for broader Pseudomonas coverage. If cultures
   negative by [**1-27**], will narrow coverage.
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting: Could be gastroenteritis versus lithium toxicity.
   - Monitor symptoms now that lithium dialyzed
   - Replete volume as needed
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to volume depletion and lithium
   toxicity. Temporarily on phenylephrine two days ago during HD, but off
   over 24 hours. Blood pressures have been stable.
   - Monitor BP
   - Hold outpt BP meds, detrol
 may consider restarting later today in
   setting of stable renal function
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Most likely lithium toxicity secondary to ARF and not
   purposeful overdose.
   - Hold Clozaril, Benztropine, Haldol per Psych recs
 but will touch
   base with them early this morning as paable renal functionte to
   150cc/hr given ?mild volume overload overnight)
   - Follow up on Psych recs: will likely restart Clozaril
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Insulin sliding scale when in house.
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Hold detrol while hypotensive.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding Lipitor until LFTs normal. Normal today so
   can consider restarting when can take PO.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with schizophrenia, hypertension, and diabetes who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and lithium toxicity. He has a history of prolonged hemodialysis (HD) for lithium clearance, which has trended down to within normal limits. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and is being monitored for signs of lithium toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. His serum sodium levels are being closely monitored for diabetes insipidus (DI). He is also being treated for acute renal failure with further HD sessions as needed, and his electrolytes, lithium levels, and creatinine are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebound lithium toxicity: The patient's lithium levels have trended down to within normal limits, but there is a risk of rebound toxicity as intra/extracellular levels equilibrate.
2. Volume overload: The patient has mild volume overload, which may require adjustments to his IV fluid rate.
3. Diabetes insipidus (DI): The patient's serum sodium levels are being closely monitored for DI, which can occur due to lithium toxicity.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but he may require further HD sessions as needed.
5. Fever: The patient's temperature has been elevated, and cultures have been sent to rule out pneumonia and other infections.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's symptoms may be due to lithium toxicity or gastroenteritis, and he is being closely monitored for signs of worsening.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but he may require further monitoring and treatment for hypotension.
8. Schizophrenia: The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, and he is being treated with antipsychotic medications as needed.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid levels are being closely monitored, and he may require further treatment for hyperlipidemia.
10. Urinary incontinence: The patient is being treated for urinary incontinence, and his detrol medication has been held due to his hypotensive status."
