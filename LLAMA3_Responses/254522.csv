   1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
   2. Multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe,
   likely
   infection, although underlying malignancy can not be excluded. Given
   history
   of lung cancer, recommend followup imaging to resolution to exclude
   underlying
   lesion.
   3. Increased number of anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, not enlarged
   by size
   criteria, but increased in number.
   4. Likely small amount of sludge layering in the gallbladder without
   acute
   cholecystitis.
   CT Head prelim read:
   No definite abnormality. Left cerebellar tubular density likely vessel.
   Note
   that MRI is more sensitive for metastases and is recommended if
   symptoms
   persist.
   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have developed
   aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying
   lung function not entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and
   that she is s/p lobectomy.  Also consistent with influenze given
   weakness, n/v, and cough.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days
   - FU urine legionella
   - Continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send sputum culture
   # Hypotension:  Close to baseline, but likely worse [**2-16**] dehydration +/-
   sepsis.  She is currently dehydrated on exam and labs are c/w
   hemoconcentration.
   - volume resuscitation using HR, Uop to titrate fluids
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), increased intracranial pressure (especially given
   possible cerebellar findings on exam and h/o lung cancer), or
   pancreatitis.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea, although
   EKG is reassuring.  Could also be influenza as above.
   - FU head CT read
   - if head CT is negative, MRI with contrast as outpatient
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - follow serial cardiac biomarkers, will get one more set this
   afternoon
   - Add stool studies
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   near baseline with IVF overnight, likely was secondary to dehydration
   and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   now with significant hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional.
   Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Check pm Hct
   - Maintain active type and screen

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recent lobectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath, cough, and suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 116 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 123/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Pleasant, thin elderly woman with weak voice and frequent wet cough
* Cardiovascular: Borderline tachycardia, regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or jugular venous distension
* Respiratory: Tachypneic with increased work of breathing, coarse late crackles at bases with some expiratory squeaks and wheezing
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended
* Neurological: Alert and oriented

Laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 31.8%
* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL

Radiological findings include:

* CT Chest: Multifocal consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobe, likely infection, although underlying malignancy cannot be excluded
* CT Head: No definite abnormality, but left cerebellar tubular density likely vessel

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and cough, along with radiological findings of multifocal consolidation, suggest a high likelihood of pneumonia.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of lung cancer and recent lobectomy, aspiration pneumonia is a possible complication.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
4. Dehydration: The patient's fluid balance and laboratory results suggest dehydration, which can lead to complications such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular instability.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and further monitoring is necessary to assess for acute kidney injury.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of lung cancer and recent surgery may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
7. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of cough, weakness, and fever are consistent with influenza, and further testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may indicate pancreatitis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected pneumonia
2. Administer IV fluids to treat dehydration and hypotension
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further testing for cardiac complications
4. Continue antiviral therapy for influenza, pending the results of the DFA test
5. Consider further imaging studies to rule out underlying lesions or complications
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further interventions for respiratory failure
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further testing for neurological complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have developed
   aspiration pneumonia in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying
   lung function not entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and
   that she is s/p lobectomy.  Also consistent with influenze given
   weakness, n/v, and cough.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days
   - FU urine legionella
   - Continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have emailed oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Hypotension:  Close to baseline, but likely worse [**2-16**] dehydration.
   She is somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.
   Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus) or possibly influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion.  Increased intracranial pressure less likely
   given normal CT.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea,
   although EKG is reassuring and cardiac biomarkers negative.
   Pancreatitis not likely due to normal amylase and lipase.
   - FU final head CT read
   - if head CT is negative, may need MRI with contrast as outpatient,
   will defer to oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - Add stool studies if develops diarrhea
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   near baseline with IVF overnight, likely was secondary to dehydration
   and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 73-year-old woman, is admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, cough, and hoarseness. She has a history of lung cancer, and recent lobectomy, and is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has improved overnight, with decreased cough and hoarseness. However, she still complains of shortness of breath and some wheezing.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a CT head scan, which showed no definite abnormality. A CT chest scan revealed multifocal consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes, likely due to infection, although an underlying malignancy cannot be excluded.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, indicating an inflammatory response. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her kidney function is normal.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96%. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute.

The patient's medications include ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for pneumonia, tamiflu for influenza, and atrovent and albuterol nebs for respiratory support. She is also receiving IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, hoarseness, and shortness of breath suggest pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not treated promptly.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of lung cancer and recent lobectomy increase her risk of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and weakness are consistent with influenza, which can progress to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Dehydration: The patient's history of vomiting and diarrhea increases her risk of dehydration, which can lead to hypotension, acute kidney injury, and other complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential acute renal failure, which can be exacerbated by dehydration and hypotension.
6. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia increases her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis increases her risk of fractures, particularly in the context of immobility and malnutrition.
9. Anxiety: The patient's symptoms of anxiety and agitation may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased risk of falls and other complications.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. Her condition requires careful assessment and management to ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nasuea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 7-10 days  (today is
   day 3 of 7)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.  Now BP
   increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion.  Increased intracranial pressure less likely
   given normal CT.  Cardiac ischemia can also present with nausea,
   although EKG is reassuring and cardiac biomarkers negative.
   Pancreatitis not likely due to normal amylase and lipase.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - Add stool studies if develops diarrhea
   - zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated, on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now near baseline
   and stable.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy:
   - have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make them aware of admission,
   are following
   - not currently receiving active treatment
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and cough. She underwent a lobectomy and is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her cardiac status is also stable, with a normal EKG and negative cardiac biomarkers. She has a history of hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis, and is taking statin and actonel medications. She has also been diagnosed with anxiety and is being treated with ativan prn.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may not be fully resolved, and she may be at risk for developing secondary infections.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, and she was treated with IVF for acute renal failure. She may be at risk for developing chronic kidney disease.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct was 32, and she has been treated with guaiac negative stools. She may be at risk for developing iron deficiency anemia.
4. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis and is taking actonel medication. She may be at risk for developing osteoporotic fractures.
5. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is being treated with ativan prn. She may be at risk for developing anxiety-related complications, such as panic attacks or insomnia.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and is taking statin medication. She may be at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart attack or stroke.
7. Lung cancer: The patient has a history of NSCLC and is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia. She may be at risk for developing recurrent lung cancer or metastases.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She may be at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is taking medication for it. She may be at risk for developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
10. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing secondary infections, particularly pneumonia, due to her compromised immune system and history of aspiration pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   73yo woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with likely
   aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days  (today is day
   3 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appoprioate
   follow-up
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel that she may be
   volume depleted causing atrial flutter, although labs not consistent
   with this picture.
   - Will give 1L NS now and then reassess
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need rate control with beta blockers, can try 5mg IV metoprolol
   if needed
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam but has been volume resuscitated.  Now BP
   increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Will hold off on further IVF for now and encourage PO intake but can
   supplement with IVF prn
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - FU C diff for diarrhea
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now near baseline
   and stable at 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, cough, and fever. She had undergone a lobectomy 2 weeks prior to admission. Her current condition is complicated by aspiration pneumonia, atrial flutter, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She is receiving treatment for her pneumonia with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, and her atrial flutter is being monitored and treated with IV fluids and beta blockers as needed. Her hypotension is thought to be secondary to dehydration, which has been resolved with fluid resuscitation. Her nausea and vomiting are likely due to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning, and she is being treated with Zofran and antivirals. Her acute renal failure is thought to be secondary to dehydration and hypotension, and she is being monitored and treated with IV fluids and medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to progress and cause further respiratory distress, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may worsen and cause further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur and cause further complications, such as organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen and cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen and cause further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
6. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer may progress and cause further complications, such as metastases or respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms may worsen and cause further complications, such as perforation, abscess, or sepsis.
8. Infection: The patient may develop further infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections, which may worsen her condition and cause further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with
   likely aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy.  Less likely influenza given negative flu swab.
   - ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days  (today is day
   4 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, have alerted oncologists regarding appropriate
   follow-up
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel likely related to new
   lung pathology.  Given 5mg IV metoprolol x2 over last 24 hours with
   good effect.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg po TID
   - Will repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control
   - Can consider cardioversion in this patient when rate controlled
   - Need to address issue of anticoagulation: CHADS2 score is 0, but
   likely should be taking aspirin daily
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam on admission but has been volume
   resuscitated.  Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Encourage PO intake
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - lipase and amylase wnl
   - FU C diff for diarrhea
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   - IVF prn for UOP and blood pressure
   - avoid renally toxic medications
   - monitor BP
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now stable
   between 27 and 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy: Have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make
   them aware of admission, are following and she has outpatient follow-up
   already scheduled
   - not currently receiving active treatment
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old woman, is a recent lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with likely aspiration pneumonia. She presents with shortness of breath, cough, and tachypnea. Her atrial flutter has been treated with metoprolol, and her heart rate has been controlled. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and has not required beta blockers in the past. Her hypotension has improved with volume resuscitation, and she is encouraged to increase her oral intake. She has nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Her acute renal failure has resolved with IV fluids, and she is being monitored for blood pressure and urine output.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and tachypnea suggest a high risk of pneumonia, which could worsen her condition if not treated promptly.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which could increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to decreased organ perfusion, which could worsen her overall condition.
4. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition, which could worsen her condition.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function, which could worsen her condition.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia could lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which could worsen her condition.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis could lead to increased risk of fractures, which could worsen her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure that her condition does not worsen.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed to treat the patient's pneumonia.
3. Continue to treat the patient's atrial flutter with metoprolol as prescribed.
4. Encourage the patient to increase her oral intake to prevent dehydration.
5. Monitor the patient's nausea and vomiting closely to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and urine output closely to prevent acute renal failure.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath
   24 Hour Events:
   - HR to 140s in am rounds, appeared to be atrial flutter with variable
   conduction, gave 1L NS which failed to bring down heart rate so started
   Metoprolol 12.5 po TID which was later increased to 25mg po TID for
   Aflutter with RVR
   - In evening, HR up to 170 while patient attempting to get up for
   bathroom unsupervised, settled back into bed and given 5 mg IV
   metoprolol with HR down to 90s following.  Multiple episodes of
   transient increased to HR of 160s afterwards. Got another IV 5mg X1,
   got 25mg m/n dose at 10pm, and put in for CXR given poor airway
   movement.  Showed worsened RML/RLL consolidation, ?on LLL too.  Asked
   for acapella valve, incentive spirometer sputum sample.
   - This morning, she reports feeling slightly better every day, able to
   talk in complete sentences.  She slept through the night, had one
   episode of diarrhea this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old woman with recent lobectomy for NSCLC presenting with
   likely aspiration pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and cough: Most likely pneumonia given CT
   findings and history of cough and weakness.  Could also have aspirated
   in the setting of nausea and vomiting.  Underlying lung function not
   entirely normal given emphysema on lung biopsy and that she is s/p
   lobectomy
   - Continue ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (day 1 = [**12-28**]) x 10 days
   (today is day 4 of 10)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Have stopped tamiflu and respiratory precautions, ruled out flu
   - Atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   - Send additional sputum culture
   - Need to follow-up resolution of CT chest to resolution of pneumonia
   to exclude malignancy, oncology is aware and will follow-up scans
   # Atrial flutter: Has history of pAfib in the past, but has not
   required beta blockers for quite some time.  Feel likely related to new
   lung pathology.  Given 5mg IV metoprolol x2 over last 24 hours with
   good effect.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg po TID, appears well rate-controlled with HR
   in the 90
   - Will repeat IV dosing as needed for rate control
   - Can consider cardioversion in this patient when rate controlled
   - Need to address issue of anticoagulation: CHADS2 score is 0, but
   likely should be taking aspirin daily
   # Hypotension:  At baseline, likely was worse [**2-16**] dehydration.  She was
   somewhat dehydrated on exam on admission but has been volume
   resuscitated.  Now BP increased and stable, patient feeling improved.
   - Encourage PO intake
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Could likely be viral gastroenteritis (such
   as norovirus), less likely influenza.  Also was possibly food
   poisoning/toxin ingestion although this likely due to timecourse.
   Increased intracranial pressure less likely given normal CT.  Cardiac
   ischemia can also present with nausea, although EKG is reassuring and
   cardiac biomarkers negative.  Pancreatitis not likely due to normal
   amylase and lipase.  Still having some diarrhea.
   - may need MRI with contrast as outpatient, will defer to outpatient
   oncology
   - FU C diff for diarrhea, will be sent this am
   - Zofran prn for nausea
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr 0.7, creatinine now resolved to
   baseline with IVF, likely was secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 32: Likely hemoconcentrated on admission,
   with hct drop from 35
27, likely somewhat dilutional, now stable
   between 27 and 30.  Was guaiac negative on rectal exam
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor daily Hct
   # Lung Cancer s/p lobectomy: Have contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology providers to make
   them aware of admission, are following and she has outpatient follow-up
   already scheduled
   - not currently receiving active treatment
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a recent lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath and cough, likely related to aspiration pneumonia. She has a history of atrial flutter and has been prescribed metoprolol to control her heart rate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant, thin elderly woman with a raspy voice, improved from previous, and frequent wet cough. Her lungs are tachypneic with some increased work of breathing, and she has rhonchi bilaterally across the lung fields.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 196 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's medical history includes a history of atrial flutter, emphysema, and lung cancer. She has undergone a lobectomy and has been prescribed ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for pneumonia. She has also been prescribed metoprolol for atrial flutter and has been started on atrovent and albuterol nebs for bronchospasm.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and cough are consistent with pneumonia, and her chest X-ray shows worsened RML/RLL consolidation.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter and her current symptoms of tachycardia and palpitations suggest that she may be at risk for further complications related to atrial flutter, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and Cr levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be related to dehydration, hypotension, or other underlying medical conditions.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, which is below the normal range. This may be related to blood loss, bone marrow suppression, or other underlying medical conditions.
5. Lung Cancer: The patient's history of lung cancer and her current symptoms of shortness of breath and cough suggest that she may be at risk for further complications related to her lung cancer, such as metastases or recurrence.

In conclusion, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a recent lobectomy for NSCLC who is currently admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath and cough, likely related to aspiration pneumonia. She has a history of atrial flutter and has been prescribed metoprolol to control her heart rate. She is at risk for several potential medical complications, including pneumonia, atrial flutter, acute renal failure, anemia, and lung cancer."
