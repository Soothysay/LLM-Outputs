You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, type II diabetes, and a history of septic shock, wound infection, respiratory failure, and small bowel obstruction.

The patient required three pressors overnight, with supratherapeutic doses of LEVO/NEO and maximum dose vasopressin, indicating severe hypotension. The patient's PT, PTT, and INR are elevated, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's platelet count is 262 K/uL, which is within the normal range.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.7°C, heart rate 97 bpm, blood pressure 101/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and SpO2 100%. The patient's mixed venous O2 saturation is 70-70%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (20.0), decreased hemoglobin (12.0 g/dL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (186 mg/dL), and elevated creatinine (4.6 mg/dL). The patient's troponin-T is 0.10, and the CK/CKMB/Troponin-T is 68/0.10. The patient's liver function tests (ALT/AST) are elevated, and the patient's differential count shows an increased neutrophil count.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 410 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 258, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's critical condition, but the patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessed. The patient's skin, neurologic, and abdominal examinations are also not assessed.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's history of septic shock, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate level (3.6 mmol/L) suggest ongoing sepsis.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated PT, PTT, and INR, as well as the patient's decreased platelet count, suggest DIC.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest AKI.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results suggest ongoing respiratory failure.
5. Wound infection: The patient's history of wound infection and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection.
6. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's history of small bowel obstruction and elevated lactate level suggest ongoing bowel obstruction.

The patient's ICU care plan includes aggressive fluid management, respiratory support, and ongoing antibiotic therapy. The patient's glycemic control and nutritional status should be closely monitored. The patient's lines, including the arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter, should be closely monitored for signs of infection or occlusion. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be continued."

   tunnelled R femoral line.
   - based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to unasyn and
   tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA (recent
   staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- Contact IR to replace fem dialysis line and to place an additional
   triple lumen cath (difficult access)
   - will check MVO2 as no JVP assessment to guide recussitation
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics

   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR 3.1.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD: on HD
   -- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH
   .
   # L3 compression deformity: chronic
   .
   # FEN: NPO
   # PPX: PPI and anticoagulated
   # CODE: confirmed full w/ HCP fiance-[**Name (NI) 1288**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7496**] but his
   brothers-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7473**] and fiance will talk today about overall goals of
   care given that he had recently requested DNR/DNI status at last
   admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR 3.1.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   Possible ileus vs. abscess or other primary infection from
   acinetobacter seeding abdomen
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR elevated today.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line
   change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   -Check labs for possible DIC-fibrinogen currently elevated, will eval
   RBC morph
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation, but may represent a different
   acute process related to infection.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD: on HD
   -- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH
   .
   # L3 compression deformity: chronic
   .
   # FEN: NPO
   # PPX: PPI and anticoagulated, pneumoboots

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall male with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock, respiratory failure, and suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, type II diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 97 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is intubated for airway protection, and his respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 410 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 262 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.10 ng/mL
* D-dimer: 593 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 401 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of septic shock, likely caused by Actinobacter bacteremia, and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia, and is being treated with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, type II diabetes, HIV infection, and a history of graft thrombosis. He is also taking medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia.
3. SBO: The patient's SBO is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
4. Graft thrombosis: The patient's history of graft thrombosis increases his risk of developing graft thrombosis again, which can lead to graft failure and sepsis.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and cryptococcal meningitis.
6. Diabetes-related complications: The patient's type II diabetes increases his risk of developing complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill male with a complex medical history and multiple organ dysfunction. He requires close monitoring and management of his septic shock, respiratory failure, and SBO to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   Possible ileus vs. abscess or other primary infection from
   acinetobacter seeding abdomen
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR elevated today.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line
   change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   -Check labs for possible DIC-fibrinogen currently elevated, will eval
   RBC morph
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation, but may represent a different
   acute process related to infection.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD: on HD
   -- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH
   .
   # L3 compression deformity: chronic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   Possible ileus vs. abscess or other primary infection from
   acinetobacter seeding abdomen
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR elevated today.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line
   change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   -Check labs for possible DIC-fibrinogen currently elevated, will eval
   RBC morph
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation, but may represent a different
   acute process related to infection.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD: on HD
   -- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH
   .
   # L3 compression deformity: chronic
   .
   # FEN: NPO
   # PPX: PPI and anticoagulated, pneumoboots

   brothers-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7473**] and fiance will talk today about overall goals of
   care given that he had recently requested DNR/DNI status at last
   admission and poor prognosis.
