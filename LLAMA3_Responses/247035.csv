   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given elevated temperature, heart rate,
   leukocytosis, and bandemia. Source of infection is likely related to
   recent bowel surgery. Remarkable leukocytosis makes C. diff most
   likely. Additional possibilities though certainly include blood or
   urinary infections given shaking chills, recent foley placement, recent
   hospitalization, etc . . . No evidence of pulmonary infection on
   history, exam, or CXR.
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
   - follow-up C. diff assay
   - continue to treat presumptively for C. diff with metronidazole
   - will continue fluoroquinolone to treat presumptively for gram
   negative infection given likely GI source
   - continue to bolus prn with lactated ringer's
   - maintain at least two peripheral IVs
   - patient going to the OR for colectomy
   .
   2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease
   Unclear if patient has Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis. Patient
   is s/p left sided hemicolectomy and has been refractory to medical
   therapy. Patient to go to the OR with surgery for likely colectomy.
   - colectomy per surgery
   - dilaudid prn for pain control
   - continue cipro / metronidazole as above
   - will follow-up with surgery in the AM regarding hydroxychloroquine
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who underwent a left colectomy and is now in the ICU due to fever and abdominal pain related to a suspected C. difficile infection.

The patient has a number of significant laboratory abnormalities, including:

* Leukocytosis (354 K/uL)
* Elevated lactate levels (4.1 mmol/L)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT 64, AST 81, Alk Phos 64, T Bili 1.4)
* Anemia (Hct 25.8%)
* Thrombocytopenia (Plt 354)
* Hypocalcemia (Ca++ 8.1 mg/dL)
* Hypomagnesemia (Mg++ 1.5 mg/dL)
* Hypophosphatemia (PO4 3.7 mg/dL)

The patient is at risk for a number of potential complications, including:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated temperature, heart rate, and leukocytosis, he is at risk for sepsis. The source of the infection is likely related to the recent bowel surgery, but other possibilities include blood or urinary infections.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are consistent with a C. difficile infection. If left untreated, this infection can lead to severe complications, including toxic megacolon and death.
* Inflammatory bowel disease: The patient's history of inflammatory bowel disease and recent surgery put him at risk for ongoing inflammation and complications.
* Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking citalopram. He may be at risk for worsening depression or suicide.
* Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia and may be at risk for worsening anemia or other complications.
* Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to his recent surgery and immobility.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his recent surgery and critical illness.
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to his prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory abnormalities, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to treat the patient's C. difficile infection with metronidazole and fluoroquinolone.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory values closely, including his lactate levels, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels.
* Continue to provide supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and pain management.
* Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist to further evaluate and manage the patient's inflammatory bowel disease and C. difficile infection.
* Consider restarting ferrous sulfate to treat the patient's iron deficiency anemia.
* Continue to monitor the patient for signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis.
* Consider consulting with a psychiatrist or psychologist to evaluate and manage the patient's depression.
* Continue to monitor the patient for signs of venous thromboembolism, including swelling, pain, and decreased mobility.
* Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to evaluate and manage the patient's respiratory status.
* Consider discontinuing the patient's ciprofloxacin and metronidazole if the patient's C. difficile infection is not improving."

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. Sepsis: Picture is distributive shock.  Pt s/p 14 L of fluid
   yesterday.  Pt with volume expansion acidosis. Patient has evidence of
   sepsis given elevated temperature, heart rate, leukocytosis, and
   bandemia. Likely secondary to c diff infection as pt came back + for c
   diff.  Pt s/p colectomy with rectal stump and ileostomy.
   -continue IV flagyl and PO Vanco, further discuss with surgery PR vanco
   - follow-up blood, urine
   - bolus PRN with LR
   - maintain at least two peripheral IVs
   -follow lactate q 4hrs
   -follow UOP, mentation, and LFTs to look for end organ ischemia and
   evidence of DIC.  Would check DIC labs if concern for DIC.
   .
   2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: likelu Crohn's Disease.  Patient was s/p
   left sided hemicolectomy and has been refractory to medical therapy.
   Now s/p colectomy with rectal stump and end ileostomy.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control, okay with SBP in the 80s as pt
   mentating well
   - ativan to assist with anxiety
   - continue cipro / metronidazole as above
   - vit K 5 IV x1 to help with clotting post surgery
   -q 4hr CBC & lactate & chem 10
   .
   3. Hypoglycemia;
   -check sugars q2 hrs in the setting of sepsis, checking LFTs to help
   figure out if pt has trouble with GNG
   -would favor D51/2NS over LR
   .
   4. Depression
   - continue citalopram
   .
   5. Iron deficiency Anemia
   Patient has iron deficiency anemia per previous labs in [**3-3**].
   - will follow-up with surgery regarding restarting ferrous sulfate
   -q 4hr HCT

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. Sepsis: Picture is distributive shock.  Pt s/p 14 L of fluid
   yesterday.  Pt with volume expansion acidosis. Patient has evidence of
   sepsis given elevated temperature, heart rate, leukocytosis, and
   bandemia. Likely secondary to c diff infection as pt came back + for c
   diff.  Pt s/p colectomy with rectal stump and ileostomy.
   -continue IV flagyl and PO Vanco, further discuss with surgery PR vanco
   - follow-up blood, urine
   - bolus PRN with LR
   - maintain at least two peripheral IVs
   -follow lactate q 4hrs
   -follow UOP, mentation, and LFTs to look for end organ ischemia and
   evidence of DIC.  Would check DIC labs if concern for DIC.
   .
   2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: likelu Crohn's Disease.  Patient was s/p
   left sided hemicolectomy and has been refractory to medical therapy.
   Now s/p colectomy with rectal stump and end ileostomy.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control, okay with SBP in the 80s as pt
   mentating well
   - ativan to assist with anxiety
   - continue cipro / metronidazole as above
   - vit K 5 IV x1 to help with clotting post surgery
   -q 4hr CBC & lactate & chem 10
   .
   3. Hypoglycemia;
   -check sugars q2 hrs in the setting of sepsis, checking LFTs to help
   figure out if pt has trouble with GNG
   -would favor D51/2NS over LR
   .
   4. Depression
   - continue citalopram

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to sepsis related to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. He underwent a left colectomy with rectal stump and end ileostomy. The patient's condition has been complicated by distributive shock, acidosis, and evidence of sepsis, which is likely secondary to the C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's distributive shock, acidosis, and elevated lactate levels indicate a high risk of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, which can lead to acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) exacerbation: The patient's IBD may exacerbate in response to the C. diff infection, leading to worsening abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malnutrition.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's sepsis and acidosis increase his risk of hypoglycemia, which can be exacerbated by the use of IV fluids and medications.
4. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen in response to his current medical condition, and it is essential to continue his antidepressant medication.
5. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia may worsen due to his ongoing blood loss and malnutrition, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
6. C. diff infection: The patient's C. diff infection may not respond to treatment, leading to a prolonged hospital stay, increased risk of complications, and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
7. Sepsis-related coagulopathy: The patient's sepsis may lead to a coagulopathy, which can increase his risk of bleeding and hematoma formation.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's sepsis and acidosis may lead to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his underlying lung disease.
9. Cardiac arrest: The patient's distributive shock and acidosis increase his risk of cardiac arrest, which can be life-threatening.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address his sepsis, acidosis, and other complications. His IV fluids, medications, and nutrition should be carefully managed to prevent hypoglycemia and promote tissue perfusion. His blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and his lactate levels should be checked every 4 hours to assess the effectiveness of his treatment. His C. diff infection should be treated aggressively, and his IBD should be managed with anti-inflammatory medications and nutritional support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who was admitted to the ICU on post-operative day #9 following a left colectomy. He was diagnosed with sepsis related to C. difficile (C. diff) infection and has been receiving treatment with IV vancomycin and metronidazole.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 111 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 105/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 96%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 16 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 35.6-41.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1-10.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 288-376 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9-1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55-95 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 28.1%
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's clinical condition is stable, and his lactate level has trended down to normal. However, he is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. C. diff sepsis: The patient's WBC count is trending downward, and his lactate level is normal. However, he is still receiving treatment with IV vancomycin and metronidazole, and his clinical condition should be closely monitored for signs of deterioration.
2. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The patient's peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparse GPCs, and he is at risk for peritonitis. His INR has trended downward with Vitamin K administration, but he should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been generally > 100 mg/dL, but he should be monitored for signs of hypoglycemia, especially if his glucose levels drop.
4. Respiratory: The patient has bibasilar crackles on examination, which may be related to pulmonary edema or atelectasis. He should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress, and diuresis should be deferred until further evaluation.
5. Depression: The patient is receiving treatment with citalopram, and his depression should be closely monitored.
6. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's HCT is stable post-operatively, but he should be monitored for signs of anemia.
7. Elevated total bilirubin: The patient's AP has been trending upward over the past several days, and his direct bilirubin is also trending upward, which may indicate a cholestatic pattern. His LFTs should be closely monitored, and a RUQ ultrasound may be considered.

Based on the patient's clinical condition and laboratory results, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue IV vancomycin and metronidazole for C. diff sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's clinical condition and laboratory results closely for signs of deterioration.
3. Continue Vitamin K administration to maintain a normal INR.
4. Monitor the patient's blood sugars and treat hypoglycemia promptly if it occurs.
5. Deferring diuresis until further evaluation of the patient's respiratory status.
6. Continue treatment with citalopram for depression.
7. Monitor the patient's HCT and treat anemia if necessary.
8. Trend LFTs and consider RUQ ultrasound to evaluate the patient's elevated total bilirubin.
9. Continue prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
10. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent a left colectomy and was admitted to the ICU with fever and abdominal pain due to sepsis related to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has received IV vancomycin and is being treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. The patient's lactate level has trended down, and WBC count is decreasing. The patient is clinically improving, but there is a concern for possible peritonitis due to the patient's IBD and the growth of sparse GPCs in the peritoneal fluid.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. C. diff sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications from the C. diff infection, including septic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Peritonitis: The patient's IBD and the growth of GPCs in the peritoneal fluid increase the risk of peritonitis, which can lead to abdominal pain, fever, and sepsis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of inflammatory bowel disease and the use of IV vancomycin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
4. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which may worsen during the post-operative period due to blood loss and inadequate iron supplementation.
5. Depression: The patient's history of depression and the use of citalopram may increase the risk of depression-related complications, including suicidal ideation and behavior.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's post-operative wound may be at risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the development of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may deteriorate due to the development of septic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, or other cardiovascular complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV vancomycin and PO vancomycin to treat C. diff sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's lactate level and WBC count to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
3. Consider switching to IV IgG therapy if the patient clinically deteriorates.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and fever to assess for signs of peritonitis.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels to prevent hypoglycemia.
6. Consider restarting ferrous sulfate to treat iron deficiency anemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and mood to assess for signs of depression.
8. Consider discontinuing citalopram and switching to a different antidepressant if the patient experiences depression-related complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's post-operative wound for signs of infection.
10. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection-related complications."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease, who underwent a left colectomy and is now in the ICU for sepsis related to C. diff infection. The patient has been clinically improving, with trending down lactate and white blood cell count, but still has a low-grade fever. He is receiving IV and PO antibiotics, and his blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient also has a rectal stump and end ileostomy, and a peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparse GPCs, which may indicate peritonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Peritonitis: Given the patient's history of IBD and the growth of sparse GPCs in the peritoneal fluid sample, there is a risk of peritonitis, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bibasilar crackles on examination may indicate pulmonary edema or atelectasis, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cholestatic Pattern: The patient's elevated total bilirubin and direct bilirubin may indicate a cholestatic pattern, which could lead to liver dysfunction and further complications.
4. Infection-related Complications: The patient's C. diff infection could lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Iron Deficiency Anemia: The patient's stable HCT post-operatively may indicate iron deficiency anemia, which could worsen his overall health and increase the risk of complications.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been generally >100, but hypoglycemia could still occur, especially if his glucose levels drop.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression and current treatment with citalopram may lead to complications, such as worsening depression or medication side effects.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV and PO antibiotics as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood and urine cultures for signs of infection.
3. Consider RUQ u/s to evaluate the patient's liver function and potential cholestatic pattern.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider diuresis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugars and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
6. Continue the patient's antidepressant medication and monitor for side effects.
7. Consider iron supplementation to address the patient's iron deficiency anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease, who underwent a left colectomy and is currently in the ICU. He was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to a C. diff infection and is being treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypoglycemia, hypotension, and tachycardia. He has a history of iron deficiency anemia and elevated total bilirubin, and is at risk for developing peritonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the C. diff infection and the presence of a rectal stump and end ileostomy.
2. Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparse GPCs, which may indicate peritonitis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been generally > 100, but he is at risk for developing hypoglycemia due to the use of IV insulin.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypotension.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate tachycardia.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement is 3L, which may indicate respiratory failure.
7. Cholestatic pattern: The patient's total bilirubin is elevated, which may indicate a cholestatic pattern.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may indicate hypernatremia.
9. Access: The patient's central venous line (CVL) may need to be discontinued due to the risk of infection.
10. Pneumoboots: The patient's pneumoboots may need to be adjusted due to the risk of respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease, who underwent a left colectomy and is currently in the ICU due to sepsis related to C. difficile infection. He has received 14 liters of fluid resuscitation and is clinically improving, with a trending down lactate level and decreasing white blood cell count. He has had low-grade temperatures overnight and is currently receiving IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. The patient's inflammatory bowel disease is likely Crohn's disease, and he is at risk for peritonitis due to his post-operative status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparse GPCs, and he is at risk for peritonitis due to his post-operative status.
2. Cholestatic pattern: The patient's total bilirubin is elevated, and his direct bilirubin is trending upward, which is concerning for a cholestatic pattern.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has bibasilar crackles on examination, which may be related to pulmonary edema or atelectasis.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been generally > 100, but he may still be at risk for hypoglycemia due to his post-operative status.
5. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's HCT is stable post-operatively, but he may still be at risk for iron deficiency anemia due to his inflammatory bowel disease.
6. C. difficile sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to his C. difficile infection, and may require further antibiotic treatment.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's bibasilar crackles on examination may be related to pulmonary edema, which could worsen his respiratory status.
8. Atelectasis: The patient's bibasilar crackles on examination may also be related to atelectasis, which could worsen his respiratory status.

ICU Care:

* Continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin
* Follow-up blood and urine cultures
* Bolus PRN with LR
* Follow UOP
* Continue Vancomycin 1g
* Continue Dilaudid PCA, Toradol
* Ativan to assist with anxiety
* Continue PO Vanco/Metronidazole
* Monitor BS
* IS at bedside
* OOB to chair, ambulate as tolerated
* Continue Citalopram
* Trend LFTs
* Consider RUQ u/s"
