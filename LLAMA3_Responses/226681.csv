You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male admitted with abdominal pain, complicated by a course of respiratory failure, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He has a history of chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently on CPAP, and his vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 87/64 mmHg. His respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, low albumin, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. He is at risk for further respiratory deterioration, which may require intubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, along with opacities on his chest X-ray, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This could be caused by aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea meet the definition of sepsis, and the most likely source is pulmonary. He is at risk for further deterioration and potential organ failure.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows opacities, which could be caused by a pleural effusion.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events, particularly with his current immobility and central venous catheter.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, and he is at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent radiology procedure increases his risk for bleeding complications.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder is a concern, particularly with the use of certain antibiotics that may lower his seizure threshold.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad antibiotic coverage for pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Perform serial ABG and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
3. Consider CT chest to evaluate for PE and pleural effusion.
4. Continue heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and bleeding status closely.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a pancreatic cyst that was drained previously. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed new symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient is currently receiving CPAP therapy, which has been weaned from 100% to 60% FIO2. He is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 168 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, alert, but uncomfortable-appearing individual with increased work of breathing, using accessory respiratory muscles. His lungs are clear, and his heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. His abdomen is soft and distended, and he has a condom catheter in place.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, with an ABG reading of 28 mmHg on the floor. He is at risk for pneumonia, particularly aspiration pneumonia, given his recent tube feeds.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which meets the definition of sepsis. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary, given his recent radiology procedures.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to hyperdynamic circulation in the setting of fever and infection.
4. Anemia/Bleed: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level, but he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has recently had a radiology procedure that may have caused bleeding.
5. Left humeral fracture: The patient has a recent fracture that is likely due to trauma sustained during a radiology procedure.
6. SMV thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein, which is being managed with anticoagulation.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, which is being managed with phenobarbitol and phenytoin.

The patient's goals of care are to return home, and his family has been informed of his condition and treatment plan. The patient is being monitored closely in the ICU, and his treatment plan includes CPAP therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.
   - Patient continues on CPAP. Ultimately, utility of NIPPV will likely
   be limited if pneumonia is his underlying issue and may need
   intubation; ok per mother.
   - serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - CT chest to evaluate for PE
   - consider A-line
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral

   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff

   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever

   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S

   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ

   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst with drainage. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with hypoxic respiratory failure and respiratory alkalosis. The patient's chest X-ray shows new opacities, which may be indicative of pneumonia, aspiration, or pleural effusion. The patient is currently on CPAP and may require intubation if pneumonia is the underlying cause.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with a heart rate of 123 beats per minute and blood pressure of 87/64 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid intake of 2,604 mL and output of 590 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL and a hematocrit level of 26.3%. The patient's white blood cell count is 6.8 K/uL, and his platelet count is 168 K/uL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor, c/w respiratory alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.
2. Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.
3. Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
4. Anemia/bleed: Hct stable, pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in admission.
5. Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
6. SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting of recent GI and RP bleed.
7. Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
8. Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status, interactive with family but nonverbal.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: Aspiration, HAP, or VAP.
2. Sepsis: Pulmonary or abdominal origin.
3. Pleural effusion: May require drainage.
4. Pulmonary embolism: May require anticoagulation and/or thrombolytic therapy.
5. Cerebral edema: May require monitoring and treatment.
6. Anemia: May require transfusion.
7. Bleeding: May require transfusion and/or surgical intervention.
8. Seizures: May require anticonvulsant therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
2. F/u sputum CX, f/u blood cultures, and CT chest to evaluate for PE.
3. Consider A-line and nasopharyngeal swab for viral.
4. Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin for seizure disorder.
5. Monitor mental status and trending Hct.
6. Continue heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.
7. Continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid for GIB prophylaxis.
8. Continue iron supplement for anemia.
9. Consider abdominal US and paracentesis for ascites.
10. Monitor for signs of bleeding and anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 4-year-old nonverbal child with hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring mask ventilation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxemia with respiratory alkalosis
* Worsening CXR with a bilateral diffuse process across all lung fields
* Fever preceding 24 hours, but currently afebrile
* Tachycardia despite resolution of fever and IVF boluses
* Persistent hypotension, requiring fluid boluses
* Anemia and positive fluid balance
* Possible SMV thrombus
* Seizure disorder, requiring continued phenobarbitol and phenytoin

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support
* Pneumonia, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction
* Sepsis, particularly with the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and possible SMV thrombus
* Cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrest
* Neurological deterioration, particularly with the patient's history of seizure disorder and cerebral palsy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially leading to anemia and hypovolemic shock
* Infection, particularly with the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and possible SMV thrombus

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad antibiotic coverage for HAP
* Continued phenobarbitol and phenytoin for seizure disorder
* Fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure
* TPN with lipids for nutrition
* Glycemic control measures
* Prophylaxis for DVT
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* VAP prevention measures

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is critically ill, requiring close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a non-verbal individual with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing worsening respiratory status, with a recent increase in respiratory rate and decrease in oxygen saturation.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 26.3%. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but the patient has a history of respiratory failure and has received broad antibiotic coverage.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their non-verbal status and inability to assess certain aspects of their examination. However, the patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 134 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/63 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and decreased oxygen saturation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's broad antibiotic coverage and history of respiratory failure increase the risk of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding disorders increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder and use of anticonvulsant medications increase the risk of seizure activity.
5. Cerebral palsy: The patient's history of cerebral palsy and non-verbal status increase the risk of neurological complications.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, broad antibiotic coverage, and close monitoring of their vital signs and laboratory results. The patient's family has been informed of the patient's condition and plan of care."

   is in satisfactory position. NGT terminates in stomach. Ascending aorta
   is ectatic. A left sided PICC line terminates in the SVC. There are no
   enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. There is new
   development of patchy pna particularly in LUL and anterior basal
   segment of RLL. There is atelectasis. There is no PE.
   Abd - There is new ill defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the
   liver measuring 2.8cm x 3 cm that may represent developing abscess.
   Stable marked ascites. No evidence of SBO. There is stable thickening

 poor sample
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss drainage with IR
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2115-3-24**] 09:10 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2115-3-24**] 11:10 PM
   - Patient maintained on CPAP during the day with stable ABG, weaned
   FIO2 from 100 to 60%, then transitioned for 2hr period to high flow
   facemask, but then increasing RR so put back on CPAP 60%
   - Required intubation for airway management.
   CT-Torso:
   Chest - There are increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  ETT
   is in satisfactory position. NGT terminates in stomach. Ascending aorta
   is ectatic. A left sided PICC line terminates in the SVC. There are no
   enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. There is new
   development of patchy pna particularly in LUL and anterior basal
   segment of RLL. There is atelectasis. There is no PE.
   Abd - There is new ill defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the
   liver measuring 2.8cm x 3 cm that may represent developing abscess.
   Stable marked ascites. No evidence of SBO. There is stable thickening
   of the sigmoid colon and rectal wall.  There is a stable left RP
   hemorrhage that now appears more organized.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure with a constellation of new fever, tachypnea, and significant hypoxia. The patient's respiratory status is declining, and the risk of pneumonia, aspiration, or pleural effusion is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which meets the definition of sepsis. The most likely source of sepsis is pulmonary, but other sources such as ascites or SBP cannot be ruled out.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to hyperdynamic circulation in the setting of fever and infection. The patient's volume status appears euvolemic, and the risk of PE is high.
4. Anemia/Bleed: The patient has a history of GIB and has a recent RP bleed, and the CT scan shows evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel wall. The patient's Hct is stable, but the risk of further bleeding is high.
5. Liver lesion: The patient has a liver lesion that may represent a developing abscess. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the risk of liver failure is high.
6. Left humeral fx: The patient has a left humeral fracture that may be due to trauma sustained during radiology. The patient's pain is controlled with lidoderm patch and morphine, but the risk of further complications is high.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient has an SMV thrombus that was diagnosed on CT scan. The patient's anticoagulation therapy was held due to recent GI and RP bleed, but the risk of further thrombotic events is high.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and the risk of seizures is high due to certain antibiotics that may lower the seizure threshold.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient has a history of cerebral palsy, and the risk of further neurological deterioration is high.

The patient's laboratory results are abnormal, with elevated WBC count, CRP, and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA.

The patient's physical examination is significant for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's lung examination is significant for coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and the patient's abdomen is soft and distended.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA.
2. Serial ABG to monitor respiratory status.
3. Repeat sputum sample to evaluate for pneumonia.
4. Consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral infection.
5. Repeat blood cultures to evaluate for sepsis.
6. F/u CTA to evaluate for PE.
7. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic events.
8. Pain management with lidoderm patch and morphine.
9. Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin for seizure disorder.

 EKG - At [**2115-3-24**] 09:10 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2115-3-24**] 11:10 PM
   - Patient maintained on CPAP during the day with stable ABG, weaned
   FIO2 from 100 to 60%, then transitioned for 2hr period to high flow
   facemask, but then increasing RR so put back on CPAP 60%
   - Required intubation for airway management.
   CT-Torso:
   Chest - There are increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  ETT
   is in satisfactory position. NGT terminates in stomach. Ascending aorta
   is ectatic. A left sided PICC line terminates in the SVC. There are no
   enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. There is new
   development of patchy pna particularly in LUL and anterior basal
   segment of RLL. There is atelectasis. There is no PE.
   Abd - There is new ill defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the
   liver measuring 2.8cm x 3 cm that may represent developing abscess.
   Stable marked ascites. No evidence of SBO. There is stable thickening

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss drainage with IR
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, and gastrointestinal bleeding, who was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed respiratory failure, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by a possible pulmonary infection, pleural effusion, and ascites, as well as a liver lesion that may be an abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, are consistent with a pulmonary infection. The patient's recent intubation and mechanical ventilation may have increased the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are consistent with sepsis. The most likely source of sepsis is the patient's pulmonary infection.
3. Liver Abscess: The patient's liver lesion may be an abscess, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may be a complication of the pulmonary infection or a separate condition.
5. Ascites: The patient's ascites may be a complication of the pulmonary infection or a separate condition.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of gastric varices increase the risk of further bleeding.
7. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may be exacerbated by certain antibiotics or other medications.
8. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's nonverbal status and lack of interaction with family members may be indicative of cerebral palsy or other neurological disorders.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad antibiotic coverage for pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Repeat sputum and blood cultures to monitor for infection.
3. Consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral infection.
4. Repeat abdominal CT scan to evaluate for liver abscess and other complications.
5. Consider abdominal ultrasound and paracentesis to evaluate for ascites and potential bowel obstruction.
6. Continue heparin prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and seizure activity closely.
8. Consider repositioning the nasogastric tube and administering fluid boluses as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 35-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a complicated course of abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is now experiencing fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, with a concern for pneumonia, sepsis, and pleural effusion. He has a history of seizure disorder, and his mental status is stable but non-verbal.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 128 bpm
* Blood pressure: 78/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 168 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 415 IU/L

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation. He has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion and patchy pneumonia on CT scan. His cardiac status is also concerning, with a low cardiac output and potential for sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's abdominal status is complicated, with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, and a possible abscess or infarction in the liver.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he has a high risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion can lead to respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure.
4. Liver abscess or infarction: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a possible abscess or infarction in the liver, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac status is concerning, and he may be at risk for sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.
6. Anemia and bleeding: The patient's anemia and bleeding can lead to further compromise of his respiratory and cardiac status.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder can be exacerbated by certain antibiotics and can lead to further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address his respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was intubated due to airway management issues. They have been receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP and high-flow facemask. The patient's chest CT scan shows increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions, patchy pneumonia, and atelectasis. The abdominal CT scan reveals new ill-defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the liver, which may represent a developing abscess. The patient has a PICC line, 20-gauge line, and arterial line in place. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The development of pneumonia and potential abscess in the liver may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function may be compromised due to the hypoattenuation, which could lead to organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, and there is a risk of bleeding, particularly with the presence of a left RP hemorrhage.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of lines and tubes make them susceptible to infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are unstable, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction or hypovolemia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ascites and potential abscess in the liver may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction or perforation.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and improve their chances of recovery."

 poor sample
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2115-3-24**] 09:10 AM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2115-3-24**] 11:10 PM
   - Patient maintained on CPAP during the day with stable ABG, weaned
   FIO2 from 100 to 60%, then transitioned for 2hr period to high flow
   facemask, but then increasing RR so put back on CPAP 60%
   - Required intubation for airway management.
   CT-Torso:
   Chest - There are increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  ETT
   is in satisfactory position. NGT terminates in stomach. Ascending aorta
   is ectatic. A left sided PICC line terminates in the SVC. There are no
   enlarged axillary/mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. There is new
   development of patchy pna particularly in LUL and anterior basal
   segment of RLL. There is atelectasis. There is no PE.
   Abd - There is new ill defined hypoattenuation of segment 5 of the
   liver measuring 2.8cm x 3 cm that may represent developing abscess.
   Stable marked ascites. No evidence of SBO. There is stable thickening
   of the sigmoid colon and rectal wall.  There is a stable left RP
   hemorrhage that now appears more organized.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output. Ddx PE.
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   - CT to evaluate for PE
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Await final CT report
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral pasy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cysts. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including respiratory failure, sepsis, tachycardia, anemia, and liver lesions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis. He is at risk for further deterioration, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which are all indicative of sepsis. He is at risk for further organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be a sign of hyperdynamic circulation or sepsis. He is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including tachycardia and bradycardia.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to bleeding or chronic disease. He is at risk for further anemia and bleeding complications.
5. Liver lesions: The patient has liver lesions that may be abscesses or infarcts. He is at risk for further liver dysfunction and potential bleeding complications.
6. Left humeral fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture that may be related to trauma or medical treatment. He is at risk for further complications, including infection and nonunion.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus that may be related to sepsis or medical treatment. He is at risk for further thrombotic complications and potential bowel infarction.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder that may be exacerbated by certain medications or medical conditions. He is at risk for further seizures and potential brain injury.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, admitted to the hospital with acute abdomen, peritonitis, and chronic pancreatitis. He was found to have a Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) thrombus, anticoagulated, and later developed retroperitoneal hemorrhage. He was readmitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxemia, intubated, and diagnosed with liver abscess, left lower lobe (LLL) and right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, and atelectasis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with severe respiratory failure, acute abdomen, and tachycardia. He has a distended abdomen, poor bowel sounds, and is not tolerating a sling for his left humerus fracture.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 124 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 96/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Spontaneous respiratory rate: 0 ipm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 168 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 415 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and cefepime for respiratory failure
* Checking sputum culture
* Attempting nasogastric tube (NGT) suction for abdominal distension
* Monitoring for signs of liver lesion and awaiting final abdominal CT read
* Managing tachycardia and hyperdynamic state
* Monitoring for signs of anemia and blood loss
* Managing left humerus fracture and not tolerating sling
* Managing SMV thrombosis and not candidate for anticoagulation

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure worsening or progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Abdominal compartment syndrome or bowel perforation
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Anemia or blood loss exacerbating respiratory failure
* Left humerus fracture complications, such as infection or non-union
* SMV thrombosis worsening or extending to other vessels
* Liver lesion complications, such as abscess or hemorrhage
* Tachycardia and hyperdynamic state worsening or progressing to cardiac failure
* Glycemic control issues or hypoglycemia
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition
* Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, admitted to the hospital with acute abdomen, peritonitis, and chronic pancreatitis. He developed a SMV thrombus, which was anticoagulated, but then developed a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. He was intubated and diagnosed with liver abscess and pneumonia. He has a history of seizure disorder and is currently taking anticonvulsant medication. He is also being treated for anemia and bleeding due to a recent gastrointestinal bleed.

Current status:

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.3°F (39.1°C)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 96/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

His laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 23.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 142 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 141 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 383 IU/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are concerning for sepsis. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 x 10^9/L, which is elevated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, which is within normal limits. However, his respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, which is elevated. He also has a history of pneumonia and pleural effusion.
3. Anemia and bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin is 23.1 g/dL, which is low. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy.
4. Liver abscess: The patient's CT scan shows a liver lesion that is consistent with an abscess. He is currently being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for an ultrasound to evaluate for interval change.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder is a concern, especially given his current antibiotic therapy. His anticonvulsant medication levels will be checked tomorrow.
6. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy is a chronic condition that may affect his respiratory and cardiovascular function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad antibiotic coverage for pneumonia and liver abscess.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue to treat his anemia and bleeding with transfusions and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's seizure disorder closely and adjust his anticonvulsant medication as needed.
5. Consider drainage of the liver abscess if it does not respond to antibiotics.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and fluid management."

   TTE ([**3-25**])
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2115-2-19**], the patient is more tachycardic. The LV systolic
   function now appears depressed. The aortic valve gradient appears
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better clarify the basis and
   severity of the aortic stenosis (as well as global LV systolic
   function).

   CTA ([**3-24**])
   1. New bilateral patchy pneumonia, particularly within the left upper
   lobe
   and right middle lobe.
   2. New ill-defined 2.8 x 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V of
   the
   liver. This may be secondary to a developing abscess. Follow-up
   ultrasound
   is recommended in 3 days.
   3. Persistent sigmoid and rectal thickening with stable marked
   abdominal and
   pelvic ascites.
   4. Stable left retroperitoneal bleed, more organized.
   5. Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph

   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2115-2-19**], the patient is more tachycardic. The LV systolic
   function now appears depressed. The aortic valve gradient appears
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better clarify the basis and
   severity of the aortic stenosis (as well as global LV systolic
   function).

* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL
* Electrolyte panel: normal
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: bilateral patchy pneumonia
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: new bilateral patchy pneumonia, new ill-defined lesion in the liver, persistent sigmoid and rectal thickening with stable marked abdominal and pelvic ascites, stable left retroperitoneal bleed, and increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions
* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Tachycardia
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Fever, sepsis
* Liver lesion, possible abscess
* Left humeral fracture

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. They have a fever of 102.3°F, tachycardia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has undergone multiple imaging studies, including transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms, which have revealed a liver lesion that is suspected to be an abscess. The patient has also been experiencing seizures, and it is unclear whether they are due to a seizure, post-ictal state, or acute bleed.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes. They have also been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefipime, and metronidazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a critical concern, and they require ongoing mechanical ventilation to support their respiratory function.
3. Liver abscess: The suspected liver abscess could lead to further complications, including sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizures could be a sign of an underlying neurological disorder, which could have long-term consequences.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be a sign of ongoing bleeding, which could exacerbate their respiratory failure and other medical complications.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
7. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes could indicate liver failure, which could lead to further complications, including coagulopathy and encephalopathy.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension could indicate cardiovascular instability, which could lead to further complications, including cardiac arrest and death."

   TTE ([**3-25**])
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2115-2-19**], the patient is more tachycardic. The LV systolic
   function now appears depressed. The aortic valve gradient appears
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better clarify the basis and
   severity of the aortic stenosis (as well as global LV systolic
   function).
   .
   CTA ([**3-24**])
   1. New bilateral patchy pneumonia, particularly within the left upper
   lobe
   and right middle lobe.
   2. New ill-defined 2.8 x 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V of
   the
   liver. This may be secondary to a developing abscess. Follow-up
   ultrasound
   is recommended in 3 days.
   3. Persistent sigmoid and rectal thickening with stable marked
   abdominal and
   pelvic ascites.
   4. Stable left retroperitoneal bleed, more organized.
   5. Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 102.3°F, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/73 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. His lung exam is notable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally with soft rhonchi.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. His white blood cell count is 5.8 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 142 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 17 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 19 U/L. His creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral patchy pneumonia, particularly in the left upper lobe and right middle lobe, as well as a new ill-defined 2.8 x 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V of the liver, which may be secondary to a developing abscess. His chest X-ray shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are consistent with sepsis, and his blood cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis are concerning for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's depressed cardiac function, as seen on echocardiogram, may be related to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Liver abscess: The patient's liver lesion may be secondary to a developing abscess, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and recent radiology procedures may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Pancreatic cyst: The patient's pancreatic cyst may be related to his seizure disorder and may require further evaluation and management.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to his gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, or other underlying conditions.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be related to his anemia, liver dysfunction, or other underlying conditions.
9. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis may be related to his respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and management.
10. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, liver failure, and cardiovascular collapse."

   TTE ([**3-25**])
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2115-2-19**], the patient is more tachycardic. The LV systolic
   function now appears depressed. The aortic valve gradient appears
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better clarify the basis and
   severity of the aortic stenosis (as well as global LV systolic
   function).
   .
   CTA ([**3-24**])
   1. New bilateral patchy pneumonia, particularly within the left upper
   lobe
   and right middle lobe.
   2. New ill-defined 2.8 x 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in segment V of
   the
   liver. This may be secondary to a developing abscess. Follow-up
   ultrasound
   is recommended in 3 days.
   3. Persistent sigmoid and rectal thickening with stable marked
   abdominal and
   pelvic ascites.
   4. Stable left retroperitoneal bleed, more organized.
   5. Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 FRACTURE, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - Repeat sputum sample
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors not currently indicated; does have PICC in place for central
   access
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis suggested(LVEF = 45 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
   moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
..Compared with the prior study (images
   reviewed) of [**2115-2-19**], the patient is more tachycardic. The LV systolic
   function now appears depressed. The aortic valve gradient appears
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better clarify the basis and
   severity of the aortic stenosis (as well as global LV systolic
   function).

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy, non-verbal, and admitted to the ICU with a complicated course, including acute abdomen, peritonitis, chronic pancreatitis, SMV thrombus, and retoperitoneal hemorrhage. He was readmitted to the ICU with progressive hypoxemia, intubated, and diagnosed with pneumonia, liver abscess, and pleural effusions. The patient has been febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis, and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying medical conditions, including pneumonia, liver abscess, and pleural effusions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his pneumonia, pleural effusions, and possible aspiration of tube feeds.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has evidence of depressed cardiac function on echocardiogram, which may be related to his tachycardia and possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Anemia and Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding and anemia, which may be exacerbated by his underlying medical conditions and treatment with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Liver Abscess: The patient has a possible abscess in his liver, which may require drainage and antibiotic treatment.
6. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in his superior mesenteric vein, which may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent further complications.
7. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, which may be exacerbated by his underlying medical conditions and treatment with certain antibiotics.
8. Cerebral Palsy: The patient has cerebral palsy, which may affect his mental status and ability to interact with his environment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover pneumonia, liver abscess, and pleural effusions.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust antibiotics and other medications as needed.
3. Consider drainage of the liver abscess if it is confirmed.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent further complications from the SMV thrombus.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further evaluation if there are any concerns.
6. Continue to manage the patient's anemia and bleeding with transfusions and other supportive measures.
7. Monitor the patient's seizure disorder and adjust medications as needed.
8. Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and pain management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old man with a prolonged hospitalization for peritonitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, SMV thrombosis, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The patient has a history of decreased alertness and apnea yesterday evening, which has now resolved.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.3°F (39.1°C)
* Heart rate: 121 bpm
* Blood pressure: 92/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory support is set to MMV/PSV/AutoFlow mode.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.7%
* Platelet count (Plt): 142 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 141 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has aspiration pneumonia with Gram-positive cocci in the sputum and evidence of volume overload. The plan is to try to diurese.
* Pneumonia: The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Hypotension: The plan is to target a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 and wean down levophed.
* Anemia: The patient will receive a transfusion to bump up the Hct.
* Liver abscess: A repeat ultrasound is planned for tomorrow.
* Seizure: The patient's Dilantin level has been corrected and is therapeutic.
* Nutrition: The patient will continue to receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
* Lines: The patient has a PICC line, a 20-gauge line, and an arterial line.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
* Pneumonia: The patient may experience worsening pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
* Hypotension: The patient may experience worsening hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
* Anemia: The patient may experience worsening anemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
* Liver abscess: The patient may experience worsening liver abscess, which can lead to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
* Seizure: The patient may experience another seizure, which can lead to brain damage, neurological deficits, and death.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with ongoing sepsis, fever, and increased levophed requirement. They received antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefipime, and metronidazole, and have ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 95% and a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction syndrome: The patient's ongoing sepsis and elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) may lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's ongoing mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing VAP.
3. Stress ulceration: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulceration, which may lead to bleeding and other complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which may lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive devices (e.g., central lines, arterial lines) increase the risk of developing nosocomial infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate kidney injury, which may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's critical illness and use of medications (e.g., vasopressors, corticosteroids) may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypernatremia.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's critical illness and use of insulin may lead to hypoglycemia, which may be life-threatening if not promptly treated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and increased vasopressor requirement. They have a history of sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tidal volume of 300 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 195 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's increased vasopressor requirement and fever suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, hepatic failure, and respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently sufficient, but there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to the need for more aggressive respiratory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension suggest ongoing cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal distension and discomfort suggest potential gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and further organ dysfunction.
5. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and respiratory failure increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
6. Catheter-related infections: The patient's central venous catheter and arterial line increase the risk of catheter-related infections, which could lead to sepsis and further organ dysfunction.
7. Glucose control: The patient's high glucose levels suggest potential glucose control issues, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
8. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional support is currently adequate, but there is a risk of malnutrition and further organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
9. Psychological distress: The patient's sedation and immobility suggest potential psychological distress, which could lead to anxiety, depression, and further organ dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, and ongoing close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and optimize outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate bump
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF, TPN; start tube feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE on prelim read.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Consider abdominal u/s and paracentesis
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed
   - Monitor mental status
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate bump
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and creatinine level. He has a history of GIB, pancreatic cyst, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is declining, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure. His ABG results show respiratory alkalosis, and his chest X-ray shows opacities consistent with pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest sepsis, and his laboratory results show elevated lactate level and white blood cell count.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and his echocardiogram shows evidence of depressed cardiac function, which may be due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Anemia/Bleed: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has received blood transfusions.
5. Liver Lesion: The patient has a liver lesion on abdominal CT scan, which may be an abscess.
6. Left Humeral Fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture, which may be due to trauma sustained during radiology.
7. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus, which may be a complication of his medical history.
8. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, which may be exacerbated by certain antibiotics.
9. Cerebral Palsy: The patient has cerebral palsy, which may affect his mental status and interaction with his family.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Respiratory Support: Continue mechanical ventilation and wean the patient off the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Antibiotic Therapy: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Fluid Management: Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid intake accordingly.
4. Pain Management: Continue pain management with lidoderm patch and morphine as needed.
5. Anticoagulation: Continue heparin SQ for the patient's SMV thrombus.
6. Seizure Prophylaxis: Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
7. Nutritional Support: Continue tube feeds and TPN with lipids.
8. Prophylaxis: Continue pneumoboots and IV PPI prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a pancreatic cyst that was drained previously. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed respiratory failure, sepsis, and hypotension. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. He has a history of ascites and has undergone three paracenteses.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine levels. His blood cultures are pending, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia, aspiration, or sepsis. He is also receiving pressors to maintain his blood pressure and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's temperature and heart rate suggest ongoing sepsis, which may lead to further complications, such as organ failure or death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may require further interventions, such as vasopressors or volume resuscitation.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he may require transfusions or other interventions to address this.
5. Liver lesion: The patient has a liver lesion that may be an abscess, which may require drainage or other interventions.
6. Left humeral fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture that may require surgical intervention or other treatments.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus that may require anticoagulation or other interventions.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder that may require adjustments to his medication regimen or other interventions.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient has cerebral palsy that may affect his mental status and cognitive function.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address his various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF, TPN; start tube feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a recent drainage procedure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 10.1-10.9 K/uL
* Hct: 23.1-28.9%
* Plt: 195-206 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-28 mmHg
* Glucose: 99-157 mg/dL
* PT/PTT/INR: 15.6/25.5/1.4
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* CXR: opacities consistent with pneumonia, possibly HAP or aspiration
* CTA: infusions/infiltrates bilaterally, no PE noted

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Gen: thin, sedated, and comfortable at rest
* HEENT: sclera anicteric, eyes sunken, MMM
* Neck: supple, thin, EJs prominent and hyperdynamic, no LAD
* Lungs: intubated, coarse BS bilaterally with soft ronchi
* CV: regular but tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, unable to appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Abdomen: soft, BS+, distended, pt appears uncomfortable on palpation
* GU: condom cath in place
* Ext: warm, cachectic, BLE contractures, + DP pulses, no cyanosis or edema
* Neurologic: responds to stimuli, but unable to assess movement, tone, or cognitive function due to sedation

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: hypoxic with ABG consistent with respiratory alkalosis, concern for pneumonia (HAP or aspiration)
* Fever/sepsis: pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea, meets definition of sepsis, most likely source being pulmonary
* Hypotension: weaning from levophed, goal MAP >65
* Tachycardia: likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection, and possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
* Anemia/bleed: Hct stable, pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of hemorrhage into bowel wall
* Liver lesion: possible abscess, abdominal US tomorrow to evaluate for interval change
* Left humeral fx: likely due to trauma, no surgical indication at this time
* SMV thrombus: plan for anticoagulation x 6 months, but held in setting of recent GI and RP bleed
* Seizure disorder: no recent reports of seizures, caution as certain antibiotics may lower seizure threshold
* Cerebral palsy: stable mental status, interactive with family but nonverbal

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia (HAP or aspiration) with possible progression to respiratory failure
* Sepsis with possible multi-organ dysfunction
* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
* Liver abscess or other complications related to the liver lesion
* Bleeding complications related to the SMV thrombus and recent GI and RP bleed
* Seizure activity due to antibiotic use or other factors
* Complications related to the patient's cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, such as aspiration or respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   - Consider additional Lasix for crackles on exam; 40mg IV x 1
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue  tube
   feeds today

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cysts. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has developed respiratory failure, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of pancreatitis, and his current symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and his sputum cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods.

The patient has also developed a fever, which meets the criteria for sepsis. His lactate levels are normal, but his blood pressure is low, and he is receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65. His urine output is adequate, and his creatinine levels are normal.

The patient has a history of anemia and has received a blood transfusion. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are stable. He has also developed a liver lesion, which is being monitored with serial ultrasound examinations.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His antibiotics should be adjusted based on the results of his blood cultures and sputum cultures.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is receiving palliative care. His nutrition is being provided through a nasogastric tube and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest a possible diagnosis of HAP or aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver lesion is being monitored, and he is at risk for liver failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of bleeding.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder can worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of seizure-related complications.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy can affect his respiratory status and increase his risk of respiratory failure.

In summary, this patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. He requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, sepsis, pneumonia, liver function, cardiovascular stability, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, seizure disorder, and cerebral palsy."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic with ABG on floor c/w respiratory
   alkalosis in setting of tachypnea.  Given constellation of new fever,
   tachypnea, and significant hypoxia, as well as new opacities on CXR,
   concern for pneumonia - HAP v. aspiration (tube feeds restarted
   yesterday); less likely VAP as was extubated several weeks prior. [**Month (only) 11**]
   also with a component of pleural effusion to opacities; recent TTE with
   nl EF but labs notable for low albumin. PE is also a concern as pt is
   bedbound; has not had pneumoboots on and just restarted heparin SQ
   yesterday for DVT ppx.  Intubated in setting of declining resp
   status/PNA. CTA yesterday with final read pending, but shows
   infusions/infiltrates b/l. No PE noted.
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole.
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   - Consider additional Lasix for crackles on exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)

   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy

   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;

   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure with an ABG showing respiratory alkalosis, which may lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has new opacities on CXR and is at risk for pneumonia, which may be complicated by aspiration or VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient has fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, meeting the definition of sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of cardiac problems, including depressed cardiac function, and may be at risk for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Anemia/Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Liver lesion: The patient has a possible abscess in the liver, which may require drainage and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Left humeral fx: The patient has a possible fracture, which may require surgical intervention and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
8. SMV thrombus: The patient has a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein, which may require anticoagulation and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
9. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and may be at risk for seizures, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

The patient's overall condition is complex, and the potential medical complications listed above highlight the need for close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy who is critically ill due to respiratory failure, sepsis from aspiration, and fluid overload. He has a history of seizures and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, levophed, and diuresis. His vital signs are stable, but he has a fever, and his respiratory support is being weaned as tolerated. He has a left humeral fracture and is at risk for further bleeding. His laboratory results show anemia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. He has a central line, arterial line, and peripheral IV lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk for further deterioration due to his underlying condition and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with antibiotics, but he is at risk for further complications such as organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload is being managed with diuresis, but he is at risk for further complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and his current anemia make him at risk for further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability.
5. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and his current anemia make him at risk for further seizure activity, which could lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's central line, arterial line, and peripheral IV lines make him at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), arterial line-associated infections, and peripheral IV-associated infections.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests suggest potential liver dysfunction, which could lead to further complications such as coagulopathy and bleeding.
8. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's fluid overload and diuresis make him at risk for electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's requirement for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) makes him at risk for nutritional deficiencies, including protein-calorie malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.
10. Code Status: The patient's code status is DNR, which means that he will not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if his heart or breathing stops. This raises concerns about his quality of life and end-of-life care."

   RUQ U/S:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could
   represent an infarct secondary to compromised blood supply through the
   right portal vein, which appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

   right portal vein, which appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient has a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, which is likely due to a pulmonary source, such as pneumonia.

The patient has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia, and sputum cultures have grown MRSA. He has also developed pleural effusions and ascites, which may be related to fluid resuscitation for hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/uL. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with a lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of respiratory failure. His mental status is stable, but he is nonverbal and requires tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia may be indicative of sepsis, which could progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of cardiac dysfunction, which could worsen if not addressed.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, and he may be at risk for liver failure if not treated promptly.
5. Infection: The patient's sputum cultures have grown MRSA, and he may be at risk for further infections if not treated with appropriate antibiotics.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatic cyst may increase his risk for further bleeding, particularly if his platelet count remains low.
7. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizure disorder and potential changes in his antibiotic regimen may increase his risk for seizure activity.
8. Cerebral edema: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase his risk for cerebral edema, particularly if his mental status deteriorates.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 118 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 85/62 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and they are receiving diuretic therapy with Lasix.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, indicating potential infection and metabolic stress. The patient's kidney function is being monitored, and they are receiving antibiotics to treat potential infections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and risk factors, there is a high likelihood of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and lactate levels suggest potential sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's increasing serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential AKI, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy suggests potential respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest potential cardiac complications, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat potential infections and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Monitor kidney function closely and consider adjusting diuretic therapy as needed to manage fluid balance.
4. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further complications."

   RUQ U/S:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on
   prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could represent an
   infarct
   secondary to compromised blood supply through the right portal vein,
   which
   appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to PSV
   will reduce PEEP from 8 to 5
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp but
   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on
   CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR,
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue  tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to PSV
   will reduce PEEP from 8 to 5
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp but
   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on
   CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR,

   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy

   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid

   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and was intubated due to respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics. He has also developed fever, sepsis, and hypotension, and is receiving pressors to maintain blood pressure. He has a history of anemia and bleeding, and has received a blood transfusion. He also has a liver lesion, which may be an abscess, and is being evaluated for possible drainage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may continue to require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he may require continued pressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Liver abscess: The patient's liver lesion may be an abscess, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to bleed or if he develops other sources of blood loss.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, and may continue to bleed if he develops other sources of bleeding or if his coagulation status worsens.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and may be at risk for seizures if his medication levels are not monitored and adjusted appropriately.
8. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may worsen if he develops other sources of brain injury or if his medication levels are not monitored and adjusted appropriately.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and may continue to bleed if he develops other sources of bleeding or if his coagulation status worsens.
10. Pancreatic cyst: The patient has a pancreatic cyst, which may continue to cause symptoms if it is not treated promptly and effectively."

   RUQ U/S:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could
   represent an infarct secondary to compromised blood supply through the
   right portal vein, which appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and was found to have multilobar pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration. He was intubated and started on antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. He has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and has had multiple episodes of hypotension, which has been treated with pressors. He has also had a liver lesion noted on CT scan, which is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration. He may require continued mechanical ventilation and may require additional respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest that he may be septic, and he is at risk for further complications, including organ failure and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to his sepsis and may require continued treatment with pressors. He is also at risk for further episodes of hypotension.
4. Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion is of concern and may require further evaluation and treatment. It is possible that the lesion may be an abscess or infarct.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the setting of his sepsis and hypotension.
6. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may be affected by his current medical status, and he may require further evaluation and treatment to manage his condition.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may be affected by his current medical status, and he may require further evaluation and treatment to manage his condition.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be worsened by his current medical status, and he may require further evaluation and treatment to manage his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support as needed.
2. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's liver lesion and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension and consider further treatment with pressors as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's anemia."

   RUQ U/S:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 330**] correlate corresponding to the hypoenhancing lesion
   seen on prior CT of [**2115-3-24**] is seen. Lesion seen on CT could
   represent an infarct secondary to compromised blood supply through the
   right portal vein, which appears nearly occluded.
   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Sputum growing MRSA ([**3-24**]) and rare gram negative rods ([**3-25**])
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to PSV
   will reduce PEEP from 8 to 5
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp but
   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on
   CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR,
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - will check drug levels tomorrow
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue  tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])

   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp but
   repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious nuchal
   rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE could
   cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen on

   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 but normal white count, lactate normal.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has had a complicated course, including respiratory failure, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status is improving, with a recent increase in tidal volume and a decrease in respiratory rate.
* Fever and sepsis: The patient has a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C) and is considered septic. His white blood cell count is normal, and his lactate level is normal.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 85/62 mmHg, and he is receiving vasopressor support.
* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 118 beats per minute, which is likely due to his fever and hyperdynamic state.
* Anemia and bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL, and he has received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has had a recent episode of rectal bleeding.
* Liver lesion: The patient has a liver lesion that is suspected to be an infarct, and he is being monitored for signs of liver abscess.
* Left humeral fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture that is likely due to trauma sustained during radiology.
* SMV thrombus: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus that is being treated with anticoagulation.
* Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder and is being treated with anticonvulsants.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic status could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure could continue to drop, leading to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate could continue to increase, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and dysfunction.
* Anemia and bleeding: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
* Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion could become infected, leading to liver abscess and sepsis.
* Left humeral fracture: The patient's fracture could become infected, leading to osteomyelitis and sepsis.
* SMV thrombus: The patient's thrombus could continue to propagate, leading to bowel ischemia and infarction.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the intensive care unit."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   2. Right pleural effusion and ascites.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).   Pleural
   effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for
   hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3, so over the past 24 hours
   have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE considered but CTA
   negative.   Patient has been inbutated for 5 days,
   - Serial ABG, recheck lactate (most recent ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis)
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - f/u sputum cx, f/u blood cultures
   - consider nasopharyngeal swab for viral
   - sputum sample with staph aureus, GNR (no sensitivities yet)
   - attempt weaning to PSV again if continues stable
   - Consider additional Lasix for crackles on exam; 40mg IV x 1
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary.  With
   ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which have
   not been c/w SBP. U/A appears clean.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on prelim CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS.
   - F/u blood and urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (urine [**3-23**] with staph
   spp, UA [**3-25**] dirty and UCx pending)
   - Repeat abdominal US today to evaluate for change in liver lesion (?
   Abscess)
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >65, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 65, wean levophed as tolerated
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR, but will F/U US report today)
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible abscess.
   - Abdominal U/S tomorrow to eval for interval change
   - Discuss possible drainage with IR (? CT guided?)
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a recent history of abdominal pain. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, fever, and hypoxia, and was intubated on the second day of admission.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a set VT of 300 mL and a spontaneous VT of 445 mL. His PIP is 21 cmH2O, and his PEEP is 8 cmH2O. His SpO2 is 96%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 118 bpm, and his blood pressure is 85/62 mmHg. His cardiac function is depressed, and he has a possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-12 mmHg, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mmHg. He is receiving norepinephrine to maintain his blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient's urine output is 3,120 mL over the past 24 hours, and his creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL.
* Hepatic: The patient has a liver lesion on imaging, which may be an abscess.
* Infectious: The patient has a fever, and his blood cultures are pending. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia and aspiration.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving pantoprazole and iron supplements.
* Neurological: The patient has a seizure disorder and is receiving phenobarbitol and phenytoin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate a septic response, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's depressed cardiac function and possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy make him at risk for cardiac failure.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver lesion may be an abscess, which could lead to hepatic failure if not treated promptly.
* Renal failure: The patient's urine output is normal, but his creatinine is elevated, which could indicate early renal failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which could increase the risk of further bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia and aspiration
* Monitoring his respiratory status and adjusting his ventilator settings as needed
* Managing his cardiac function with pressors and fluid boluses
* Monitoring his liver function and considering drainage of the liver lesion if it is an abscess
* Managing his gastrointestinal bleeding with pantoprazole and iron supplements
* Monitoring his seizure disorder and adjusting his anticonvulsant medications as needed
* Continuing his nutrition with TPN and Vivonex

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy (CP) who is still requiring ventilator support for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has a complex medical history, including a recent surgical procedure, and is currently receiving multiple medications and infusions.

Key findings from the physical examination include:

* No acute distress
* Normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat
* Normal cardiovascular examination
* Soft, non-tender, and distended abdomen
* Right and left lower extremity edema (1+)
* Neurological examination is limited due to the patient's condition

Laboratory results show:

* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels
* Abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Seizure disorder
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Fungal or bacterial sepsis
* Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Hypovolemic shock
* Hemorrhagic shock

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)
* Progression of anemia and potential need for blood transfusions
* Development of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Potential need for surgical interventions, such as tracheostomy or laparotomy

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued broad-spectrum antibiotics for PNA
* Diuresis for volume overload
* Weaning of pressors as tolerated
* Monitoring for septic shock and cardiac dysfunction
* Management of anemia and electrolyte imbalances
* Close monitoring of respiratory function and potential need for tracheostomy
* Regular reassessment of the patient's condition and potential need for surgical interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU for 6 weeks due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and continued ventilator requirement. The patient has a history of seizures, anemia, tachycardia, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38°C)
* Heart rate: 126 bpm (108-130 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 85/63 mmHg (73-101/77-86 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 35 breaths per minute (19-35 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 206 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mEq/L
* Glucose: 99 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L

The patient's medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) 1 mg/hour
* Fentanyl (Concentrate) 30 mcg/hour
* Norepinephrine 0.06 mcg/Kg/min
* Furosemide (Lasix) 12.48 PM
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 08:42 PM
* Other medications as listed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Seizure without status epilepticus
* Alteration in nutrition
* Tachycardia
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Fracture, other
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sputum with more than one organism
* Continue to diurese for volume overload, aiming for a net out of 500 cc
* Wean pressors as tolerated for septic shock
* Follow for fevers, WBC trending down, and overall doing well
* Anemia: Hct stable
* SMV thrombosis
* Retroperitoneal hemorrhage
* ICU care: Nutrition - now off TPN, tolerating TFs at full rate
* Glycemic control
* Lines: PICC line, 20-gauge line, arterial line
* Prophylaxis: DVT - s/q hep, stress ulcer - PPI
* VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as ARDS, pneumonia, or respiratory arrest.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated, leading to further complications such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Seizure: The patient's seizure may worsen or recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as status epilepticus, brain damage, or death.
* Infection: The patient's infection may worsen or spread if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's hemorrhage may worsen or recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as hypovolemic shock, cardiac arrest, or death.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to his underlying condition and the use of pressors, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's family has been informed of the potential risks and benefits of tracheostomy and prolonged ventilator weaning, and they will need to consider this option carefully."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier once
   extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, A-line in right brachial artery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cyst, and a recent history of abdominal pain. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, hypoxia, and tachypnea, and was intubated on day 2 of admission. He has since developed a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia and sepsis. He has also been found to have a pleural effusion, likely due to fluid resuscitation, and has been diagnosed with a possible liver abscess.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated for fever, sepsis, and hypotension. He is also receiving diuretics to manage his pleural effusion and ascites. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes, and his blood cultures are positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and he may require further mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and he may require further antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may require further management, including vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
4. Liver abscess: The patient's liver abscess may require further management, including antibiotic therapy and drainage.
5. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may require further management, including drainage and diuretics.
6. Ascites: The patient's ascites may require further management, including diuretics and paracentesis.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may require further management, including endoscopy and bleeding control measures.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may require further management, including anticonvulsant therapy and monitoring.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may require further management, including physical therapy and rehabilitation.
10. SMV thrombus: The patient's SMV thrombus may require further management, including anticoagulation therapy and monitoring.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, wean levophed as tolerated (may be easier
   once extubated and off sedation)
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst drainage. He was admitted with abdominal pain and was later transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure, hypoxia, and tachypnea. He was intubated and received antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: intubated on CPAP/PSV with a respiratory rate of 23-35 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.
* Hemodynamic status: tachycardic with a heart rate of 111-141 beats per minute, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 102/89-107/93 mmHg.
* Fever: febrile with a temperature of 101-102°F (38.3-39°C).
* Laboratory results: WBC count of 6.5-10.7 K/uL, Hct of 28.1-30.4%, and platelet count of 171-216 K/uL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires ongoing respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: the patient has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which may be indicative of sepsis.
3. Hypotension: the patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other underlying causes.
4. Anemia: the patient's Hct is low, which may be due to blood loss, hemolysis, or other causes.
5. Bleeding: the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding due to his low platelet count.
6. Liver lesion: the patient has a possible liver abscess or infarct, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Left humeral fracture: the patient has a possible fracture of the left humerus, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. SMV thrombus: the patient has a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein, which may require anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Ongoing antibiotic therapy for suspected pneumonia.
2. Respiratory support with CPAP/PSV and PEEP.
3. Hemodynamic support with fluids and pressors as needed.
4. Monitoring of the patient's temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
5. Laboratory monitoring of the patient's WBC count, Hct, and platelet count.
6. Further evaluation and management of the patient's liver lesion and left humeral fracture.
7. Anticoagulation therapy for the SMV thrombus.
8. Pain management with lidoderm patch and morphine as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, and other medical conditions. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 102/89 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, and their respiratory support is being closely monitored.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizure recurrence**: The patient has a history of seizure activity, and there is a risk of recurrence, particularly with the continuation of anticonvulsant therapy.
2. **Nutritional deficiencies**: The patient's altered nutrition status may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate their underlying medical conditions.
3. **Tachycardia**: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of underlying cardiac instability, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
4. **Anemia**: The patient's anemia may worsen if they continue to experience blood loss or if their underlying medical conditions are not adequately managed.
5. **Respiratory failure**: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure or respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if their underlying condition is not adequately managed.
6. **Bloodstream infections**: The patient's indwelling lines and catheters may increase their risk of developing bloodstream infections, which can be life-threatening.
7. **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)**: The patient's immobility and medical conditions may increase their risk of developing DVT and PE, which can be fatal if left untreated.
8. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The patient's altered nutrition status and medical conditions may increase their risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
9. **Renal failure**: The patient's medical conditions and medications may increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory support closely to prevent respiratory failure and cardiac instability.
2. Continue anticonvulsant therapy and monitor for seizure recurrence.
3. Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion therapy if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's underlying medical conditions, including their respiratory failure, anemia, and other comorbidities.
6. Monitor the patient's indwelling lines and catheters for signs of infection and remove them if necessary.
7. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of DVT and PE.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider prophylactic therapy to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pancreatic cyst, and multilobar pneumonia. He was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure and was intubated on day 2. He has been receiving antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia and has a sputum culture growing MRSA. He has also been diagnosed with sepsis and has been febrile with a temperature of 101°F. He has a history of liver lesions, including a possible liver abscess, and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101°F
* Heart rate: 111 bpm
* Blood pressure: 102/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 6.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 171 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 153 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he may require increased respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest sepsis, and he may require additional antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
3. Liver abscess: The patient's liver lesions may be infected, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and decreased cardiac function may indicate cardiac dysfunction, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and recent transfusion of packed red blood cells may indicate ongoing bleeding, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder and current antibiotic therapy may increase his risk of seizures, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Cerebral palsy: The patient's underlying cerebral palsy may affect his respiratory and cardiac function, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider increasing respiratory support as needed.
3. Evaluate the patient's liver lesions further and consider treating any infected lesions.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's seizure disorder closely and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cerebral palsy and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has been weaned off pressors and peep, and sedation has been discontinued.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F) with a current temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 117 beats per minute with a range of 111-141 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 96/71 mmHg with a range of 65-107 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute with a range of 21-34 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 92%

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation, and 40% FiO2. His ABG results show a pH of 7.49, pCO2 of 34 mmHg, and pO2 of 82 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and his neurological examination is abnormal, with no attentive response, no follow of simple commands, and no movement or tone assessment.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 171 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
* Glucose: 153 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Seizure, without status epilepticus
* Alteration in nutrition
* Tachycardia, other
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Fracture, other
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Wean PSV to 4-17. Pulmonary edema: Continue lasix diuresis. HAP: Continue antibiotics for 8 days. Will remove a-line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the PSV is not weaned down properly, leading to further respiratory distress.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary edema and continued antibiotics for 8 days may increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's altered nutrition, tachycardia, and anemia may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not recognized and treated promptly.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and continued bleeding may lead to further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and bleeding into vital organs.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential cardiac arrhythmias may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been weaned off pressors and peep, and sedation has been discontinued. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/71 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation via a CPAP/PSV mode. His respiratory support is being weaned, with a Vt of 324 mL and a PS of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of seizures, anemia, and fracture, and is at risk for further complications. His laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, with a count of 10.7 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment includes seizure, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, anemia, acute respiratory failure, and fracture. His plan includes weaning of PSV to 4-17, continuation of lasix diuresis, and antibiotics for 8 days. He will also have his arterial line removed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant risk, and he may require further intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's anemia and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which could lead to further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and weaning of mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and elevated white blood cell count may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and anemia may indicate cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure history and anemia may indicate neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and debilitation may increase his risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections or wound infections.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - likely extubation tomorrow with optimization today
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 1000cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   - change foley today, follow up on culture data
   .
   #Hypotension. Off Vasopressors. [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and
   currently sedated which may contribute. MAP goal > 60. No further
   episodes of AMS since starting pressors on [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary is provided:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic cysts, and SMV thrombus. He was admitted with abdominal pain and peritonitis, and developed a retoperitoneal hemorrhage. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU due to progressive hypoxemia.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Temperature: 100.6°F (38.1°C) with slightly elevated white blood cell count
* Respiratory status: Tolerating pressure support trial well, with PEEP at 5 cmH2O and PSV at 10 cmH2O
* Hemodynamic status: Tachycardic (117 bpm) with a blood pressure of 91/66 mmHg
* Laboratory results: WBC 189 K/uL, Hct 30.2%, Plt 189 K/uL, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, Glucose 139 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: CT with possible liver abscess, CTA with LLL and RLL PNA and atelectasis, and effusions
* Medications: Vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, lasix, pantoprazole, and phenobarbitol

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest sepsis, and the laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he requires intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and depressed cardiac function on echocardiogram suggest cardiac dysfunction, which may be induced by tachycardia.
4. Liver lesion: The patient has a possible liver abscess or infarct, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatic cysts, and his platelet count is low.
6. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, suggesting infection.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction.
8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to fever, infection, or cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia
2. Daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, with attempts to wean to PSV
3. Gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 1000cc

   Assessment and Plan
35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, non-verbal, admitted to the ICU with acute abdomen, peritonitis, chronic pancreatitis, and a SMV thrombus. He developed a retoperitoneal hemorrhage and was readmitted with progressive hypoxemia, intubated, and diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia. He has a fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and his condition is complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure, and liver lesions. He is currently receiving antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA, and his treatment plan includes diuresis with lasix boluses, gentle diuresis, and ABG later today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest sepsis, and his condition is complicated by the presence of a pulmonary source of infection.
3. Liver lesions: The patient's liver lesions may be a sign of liver abscess or infarction, which could lead to further complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, including a retoperitoneal hemorrhage and gastric varices, and is at risk of further bleeding.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of cardiac complications, including tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, including peritonitis and pneumonia, and is at risk of developing further infections.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver lesions may lead to liver dysfunction, which could impact his overall health.
8. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and fluid resuscitation may lead to renal failure.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid resuscitation and diuresis may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status is compromised, and he is at risk of malnutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting his ventilator settings as needed.
3. Continue diuresis with lasix boluses to manage fluid overload.
4. Monitor the patient's liver lesions and consider further imaging or biopsy if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and consider further bleeding prophylaxis if necessary.
6. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram-negative coverage if the patient's WBC does not continue trending down.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further cardiac evaluation if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte status and consider further electrolyte repletion if necessary.
9. Consider further nutrition support, such as enteral or parenteral nutrition, to ensure the patient's nutritional needs are met.
10. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - continue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole x total 8 days (Day 1 = [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, attempt to wean to
   PSV; reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 this morning without problems
   - ABG later today
   - gentle diuresis with IV lasix boluses to goal net negative 500cc
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - f/u beta glucan, aspergillus galactomannan
   - consider D/C picc line
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. Continues to wean from levophed
 currently at 0.06.
   [**Month/Year (2) **] pressures run low and currently sedated which may contribute.
   MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting pressors on
   [**3-25**].
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-27**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate. Ok to intubate or use pressors. No CPR or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a temperature of 100.6°C (38.1°F) and slightly elevated white blood cell count. They are receiving Lasix IV boluses to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1L/24 hours. The patient is tolerating pressure support trial with PEEP at 5 and PSV at 10. The ET tube has been advanced. The patient has a history of antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefipime, and vancomycin.

Lab results show:

* WBC: 10.7 K/uL (slightly elevated)
* Hct: 30.4%
* Plt: 216 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6 mg/dL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 136 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.7/27.6/1.4, Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 2.0 mg/dL, Lactate: 1.8

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature and WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for pressure support and oxygen therapy indicates respiratory failure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, but the total fluid input is 1,966 mL, which may still be excessive.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 216 K/uL, which is slightly low.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney injury.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits, but may still be imbalanced.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's glucose level is 136 mg/dL, which may indicate nutritional deficiencies.
8. Infection: The patient's UA shows moderate leukocyturia, positive nitrates, and few bacteria, which may indicate an infection.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's need for pressure support and oxygen therapy increases the risk of VAP.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may be inadequate, increasing the risk of stress ulcer.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and addressed to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and volume overload. He has been mechanically ventilated and has undergone a successful 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 93 and a spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) of 224 mL. He has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 84/61 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 95% on a FiO2 of 40%. He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line (AL) in place.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, and a white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.5 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and his renal function tests (RFTs) show a creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes diuresis to remove excess fluid and aim for extubation tomorrow. He will continue to receive vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for another day, and then his antibiotics will be discontinued. He will also receive prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his lung function worsens or if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line, which may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications if his platelet count decreases further.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for renal failure if his kidney function worsens.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are normal, but he may be at risk for liver failure if his liver function worsens.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cerebral palsy and may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or brain edema."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - discontinue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole as patient has completed total 8 days (Day 1 =
   [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - optimize for extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.
   - discontinue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole as patient has completed total 8 days (Day 1 =
   [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - optimize for extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Consider adding additional coverage for double gram negative
   coverage if WBC does not continue trending down.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and pancreatic cysts. He was admitted with abdominal pain and complicated course, and has since developed respiratory failure, sepsis, and hypotension. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with increasing tachypnea and hypoxia. He is at risk for further respiratory compromise and potential complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, likely secondary to MRSA pneumonia, and is at risk for further complications such as organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is at risk for further episodes of hypotension and potential complications such as cardiac dysfunction and organ failure.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Anemia/Bleed: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding complications.
6. Liver Lesion: The patient has a liver lesion, which is potentially ischemic or infarcted, and is at risk for further complications such as liver failure.
7. Left Humeral Fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture, which is likely secondary to trauma, and is at risk for further complications such as infection and non-union.
8. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus, which is potentially life-threatening, and is at risk for further complications such as bowel ischemia and infarction.
9. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, which is currently well-controlled, but is at risk for further seizures and potential complications such as status epilepticus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for further respiratory complications, including pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of mortality.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis and hypotension increase his risk for further organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension increase his risk for further cardiac complications, including tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia increase his risk for further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver lesion increases his risk for further liver complications, including liver failure and portal hypertension.
6. Bowel Ischemia/Infarction: The patient's SMV thrombus increases his risk for further bowel complications, including bowel ischemia and infarction.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent further complications and optimize his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes overnight may be
   secondary to aggressive diuresis.
   - discontinue antibiotic coverage for HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, metronidazole as patient has completed total 8 days (Day 1 =
   [**3-23**])
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - optimize for extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Broad abx as above with good gram positive, gram neg, and anaerobic
   coverage. Today is last day of 8-day course.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cysts. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and was subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated on CPAP/PSV with a respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute, with a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular status: Tachycardic with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, with a blood pressure of 80/61 mmHg. The patient has a history of hypotension and has been treated with pressors.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has been diuresed with lasix boluses over the past 24 hours, with a total fluid balance of -1151 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is not currently measurable.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a fever and tachycardia, and has been treated with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's sputum has grown MRSA, and he has a pleural effusion likely due to fluid resuscitation.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has been treated with pantoprazole and iron supplements. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, and his hematocrit is 30.4%.
* Neurological status: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and has been treated with phenobarbitol and phenytoin. The patient's mental status is stable, but he is nonverbal and has limited interaction with his family.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he may require continued mechanical ventilation and respiratory support.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate ongoing sepsis, which may require further antibiotic therapy and supportive care.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he may require continued pressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or inadequate iron supplementation.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may indicate ongoing liver damage or infection.
* Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may require continued treatment with anticonvulsant medications.
* Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may require continued supportive care and management of his neurological symptoms.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, anemia, liver dysfunction, seizure disorder, and cerebral palsy. The patient's condition is currently stable, but he may require continued medical management and supportive care to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and volume overload. The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and has been receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, with a Vt of 369 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 bpm.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 94/75 mmHg, and their central venous pressure is not reported.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.7, and their platelet count is 142 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L.
* Imaging: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on a chest X-ray, which have improved but not resolved.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not attributed to ARDS. The patient is doing well on SBT and is likely to be extubated this morning.
* Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, likely due to hemorrhage or bleeding.
* Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which may be related to their underlying condition or medication.
* Seizure: The patient had a seizure, but it was not status epilepticus.
* Fracture: The patient has a fracture, but the location and severity are not specified.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and may be extubated this morning.
* Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs will be assessed and addressed.
* Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and managed.
* Lines: The patient has a PICC line and an arterial line in place.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to their respiratory support and will require close monitoring.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and their disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill and will require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The
   current respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging,
   secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may
   also be contributing.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - suction and light chest PT
   - consider gentle diuresis although difficult given low BP
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: - Extubated in AM with plan to NOT reintubate
   - Had some coughing and desat to upper 80s post-extubation, as well as
   fever; recultured and gave dose of 40 mg IV lasix, which seemed to help
   - TF held given risk of aspiration
   - Hypotensive to SBPs in 70s in PM after diuresing ~800 cc to Lasix; no
   intervention and BPs improved to 90s.
   - Overnight while sleeping MAP dropped to 55 and SBP to < 70, so got
   250 cc bolus

   secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may
   also be contributing.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - suction and light chest PT
   - consider gentle diuresis although difficult given low BP
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family

   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted to the MICU with abdominal pain, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and was intubated due to respiratory failure.

The patient has undergone a significant course of treatment, including antibiotics, diuresis, and pressors, but continues to experience fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. His respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging, secretions, and pulmonary edema.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress can worsen, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen, leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs and potential organ failure.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and decreased cardiac function may indicate tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Anemia/bleed: The patient's anemia and potential bleed can worsen, leading to further decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion may progress, leading to liver failure and potential death.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, leading to further seizures and potential brain damage.
8. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may worsen, leading to further neurological dysfunction and potential death.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive aggressive treatment, including antibiotics, diuresis, and pressors, as well as close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results. The patient's family should be informed of his condition and the potential complications that can arise, and should be involved in the decision-making process regarding his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated yesterday; has had a
   few low O2 sats.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, IV PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, PIV, D/C A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and pancreatic cysts. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. He was started on antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, which grew MRSA. He has had a complicated course, with fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and has required diuresis and pressors to manage his blood pressure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Extubated yesterday, but has had some low O2 sats and is being monitored closely.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive, with a MAP goal of >60. He has been on pressors, but is no longer on vasopressors.
* Hematological: Anemic, with a Hct of 27.9%. He has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is being transfused as needed.
* Infectious: Fever, with a temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) overnight. He has been on antibiotics, but no further episodes of AMS have occurred.
* Gastrointestinal: Has had GIB, with a CT scan showing evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel wall. He is receiving pantoprazole and iron supplements.
* Hepatic: Has a liver lesion, which is likely an infarct or ischemia, rather than an abscess.
* Neurological: Has a seizure disorder, but has not had any recent seizures. He is being monitored closely for signs of seizure activity.
* Renal: Has been diuresed with Lasix boluses, and his urine output is stable.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

* Respiratory: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, tachycardia, or cardiac dysfunction
* Hematological: Anemia, bleeding, or coagulopathy
* Infectious: Sepsis, septic shock, or further episodes of AMS
* Gastrointestinal: GIB, perforation, or abscess
* Hepatic: Further liver damage or abscess
* Neurological: Seizures, altered mental status, or cerebral edema
* Renal: Acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or electrolyte imbalance

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status, and consider reintubation if necessary.
* Manage his cardiovascular status with pressors and fluids as needed.
* Monitor his hematological status, and transfuse as needed.
* Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
* Monitor his gastrointestinal status, and consider paracentesis if necessary.
* Monitor his hepatic status, and consider further imaging or biopsy if necessary.
* Monitor his neurological status, and consider seizure prophylaxis if necessary.
* Monitor his renal status, and consider further imaging or biopsy if necessary.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the plan as necessary to prevent potential complications and optimize his outcome."

   - Had some coughing and desat to upper 80s post-extubation, as well as
   fever; recultured and gave dose of 40 mg IV lasix, which seemed to help
   - TF held given risk of aspiration
   - Hypotensive to SBPs in 70s in PM after diuresing ~800 cc to Lasix; no
   intervention and BPs improved to 90s.
   - Overnight while sleeping MAP dropped to 55 and SBP to < 70, so got

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: - Extubated in AM with plan to NOT reintubate
   - Had some coughing and desat to upper 80s post-extubation, as well as
   fever; recultured and gave dose of 40 mg IV lasix, which seemed to help
   - TF held given risk of aspiration
   - Hypotensive to SBPs in 70s in PM after diuresing ~800 cc to Lasix; no
   intervention and BPs improved to 90s.
   - Overnight while sleeping MAP dropped to 55 and SBP to < 70, so got
   250 cc bolus

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated yesterday; has had a
   few low O2 sats.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - continue with daily RSBI and SBT as tolerated, likely will extubate
   today
   - follow ABGs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with repletion while on Lasix
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation. He was diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia, and his sputum grew MRSA.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was extubated yesterday but has had a few low O2 sats. He is currently on nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 94%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension, with a SBP of 70s, and requires boluses of IV fluids to maintain a MAP > 60. He has a history of cardiac dysfunction and may have tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
* Infectious: The patient has a fever and tachycardia, meeting the definition of sepsis, with a likely source of pulmonary (MRSA). He has a history of ascites and SBP, but recent taps have not been c/w SBP.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatic cyst. He has a NG tube in place and is receiving TPN and tube feeds.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on anticonvulsants. He has a stable mental status but is nonverbal.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require re-intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest ongoing sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatic cyst may lead to further bleeding or complications.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizure disorder and current anticonvulsant therapy may lead to seizure activity.
6. Liver lesion: The patient's abdominal CT scan showed a possible liver lesion, which may be an abscess or infarct.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient has a history of SMV thrombus, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Manage the patient's cardiovascular instability with IV fluids and pressors as needed.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with NG tube and TPN.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust anticonvulsant therapy as needed.
6. Consider further imaging to evaluate the liver lesion.
7. Plan for anticoagulation therapy to prevent further SMV thrombus."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and volume overload. He was extubated yesterday and is still requiring a large amount of oxygen and using accessory muscles to breathe. He has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and has completed a course of antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, but he has tachycardia and tachypnea. He has a low-grade fever and is receiving gentle chest physical therapy. His laboratory results show anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and he may require further interventions such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to improve his oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is a potential source of ongoing respiratory failure and may require further antibiotic treatment.
3. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload may be contributing to his respiratory failure and may require further diuresis or other interventions to manage.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to his tachycardia and tachypnea, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may be contributing to his respiratory failure and may require further oxygen therapy or other interventions to improve his oxygenation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fever and elevated lactate levels may be indicative of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and tachypnea may be indicative of cardiac complications such as congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias, which require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's encephalopathy may be contributing to his respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course,
   now with new fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and
   hypoxia on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Given his new fever,
   respiratory deterioration, and imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia he was started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl
   (concern for aspiration given recently started tube feeds).  Sputum
   growing MRSA.  Pleural effusions also noted on imaging, likely due to
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the setting of albumin of 2.3,
   so over the past 24 hours have been diuresing with lasix boluses.  PE
   considered but CTA negative.   Few apneic episodes two nights ago may
   be secondary to aggressive diuresis.  Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The
   current respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging,
   secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam. Pulmonary edema may
   also be contributing.
   - Completed 8-day course of vanc, cefepime, metronidazole
   - suction and light chest PT
   - consider gentle diuresis although difficult given low BP
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Fever/sepsis: Pt febrile with tachycardia and tachypnea; meets
   definition of sepsis with most likely source being pulmonary (MRSA).
   With ascites, SBP is also possible although he is now s/p 3 taps which
   have not been c/w SBP. Urinalysis and culture from [**3-23**] with staph spp
   but repeat appears clean with NGTD.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4578**] with no obvious
   nuchal rigidity although exam limited by pt cooperation.  Again, PE
   could cause similar sx of fever and respiratory distress but none seen
   on CTA. Continues febrile daily. No further episodes of AMS. CT read as
   possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Continues to have
   fever to 101 on [**2-24**] overnight but normal white count, lactate normal.
   - Off Abx as above.
   - Goal CVP 8-12 but no measurements available currently
 will bolus
   for tachycardia, UOP < 30cc/h, goal MAP >60, CvO2 >70
   - Pressors for MAP > 55-60, off vasopressors
   - Monitor mental status
   - Consider paracentesis if continues febrile and no other source (would
   likely need to be done by IR)
   .
   #Hypotension. MAP goal > 60. No further episodes of AMS since starting
   pressors on [**3-25**]. Not on vasopressors.
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Abx as above
   - Fluid boluses prn, though patient with [**Month/Year (2) 4578**] heart rate 110s;
   appears hypervolemic
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - continue pantoprazole 40mg IV bid
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at [**Date Range 4578**].
   .
   FEN: NG tube likely in duodenum, bolus IVF prn, TPN; continue tube
   feeds today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst drainage. He was admitted with abdominal pain and was intubated due to respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. He has also been diagnosed with sepsis, with a likely source of infection being pulmonary (MRSA). He has been febrile daily and has had a recent episode of hypotension, which has been treated with pressors. He has also had a recent episode of tachycardia, which is likely due to hyperdynamic state.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure, with a current respiratory distress likely due to mucous plugging and secretions
* Sepsis, with a likely source of infection being pulmonary (MRSA)
* Hypotension, which has been treated with pressors
* Tachycardia, which is likely due to hyperdynamic state
* Fever, which has been treated with antibiotics and antipyretics
* Anemia and bleeding, with a stable Hct and no recent reports of seizures
* Liver lesion, which is likely due to ischemia or infarction
* Left humeral fracture, which is likely due to trauma sustained during radiology
* SMV thrombus, which has been held in setting of recent GI and RP bleed
* Seizure disorder, which is stable and being treated with anticonvulsants

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure, which could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications
* Sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications
* Hypotension, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications
* Tachycardia, which could lead to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications
* Fever, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications
* Anemia and bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and potentially life-threatening complications
* Liver lesion, which could lead to further liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications
* Left humeral fracture, which could lead to further pain and potentially life-threatening complications
* SMV thrombus, which could lead to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications
* Seizure disorder, which could lead to further seizures and potentially life-threatening complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a fungal infection. The patient has been experiencing a range of complications, including:

1. Fungal infection: The patient has grown yeast in their blood and urine cultures, indicating a severe fungal infection. The patient has been started on fluconazole, but the ID team may prefer to switch to micafungin.
2. Catheter-related complications: The patient has had difficulty flushing and drawing labs from the PICC line, which may need to be pulled. The IV nurse was unable to obtain peripheral access, and the patient may require an EJ or central line insertion.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a significant fluid imbalance, with a total input of 2,616 mL and a total output of 930 mL. This may be related to the patient's cardiac status and the need for vasopressors.
4. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 183, indicating a need for ongoing respiratory support.
5. Abnormal lab results: The patient has abnormal lab results, including a low white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, with readings ranging from 76/53 to 115/83 mmHg.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fungal infection and fluid imbalance increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiovascular instability and labile blood pressure increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and abnormal ABG results increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid imbalance increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing treatment with anticoagulants increase the risk of further bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's fungal infection and immunosuppressed state increase the risk of secondary infections.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular instability and ongoing vasopressor therapy increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac tamponade.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - daily blood cultures
   - TTE
   - pull picc line and arterial line pending obtainment of new central
   access
   - start fluconazole 200 IV (6mg/kg)
   - foley catheter changed overnight
   - ophthalmologic evaluation
   - check LFT, EKG
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has since developed a complicated course with fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated, with coarse bilateral breath sounds and diffuse rhonchi, likely due to mucous plugging and secretions.
* Cardiovascular status: Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, and normal blood pressure.
* Renal status: Normal creatinine levels, with no evidence of acute kidney injury.
* Hepatic status: Elevated liver enzymes, with a possible liver lesion or infarct noted on imaging.
* Hematological status: Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a possible bleeding diathesis.
* Neurological status: Nonverbal, with a stable mental status and no recent reports of seizures.

The patient has a variety of potential medical complications, including:

1. Yeast bloodstream infection: The patient's blood culture is growing yeast, which may be a sign of a systemic infection.
2. Mucous plugging and secretions: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to mucous plugging and secretions, which may require suctioning and chest physical therapy.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
4. Liver lesion or infarct: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and a possible liver lesion or infarct is noted on imaging.
5. Hemorrhage or infarct: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and a possible bleeding diathesis, which may increase the risk of hemorrhage or infarct.
6. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's tachycardia may be contributing to cardiac dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, which may be exacerbated by certain antibiotics or other medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

   - Blood CX ([**3-31**]) growing yeast
   - Urine CX ([**3-29**]) growing >100K yeast, [**3-31**] growing ~9000 yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - daily blood cultures
   - TTE
   - pull picc line pending obtainment of new temporary central/peripheral
   access
   - start fluconazole 200 IV (6mg/kg)
   - foley catheter changed overnight
   - ophthalmologic evaluation
   - check LFT, EKG
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, A-line in right brachial artery
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst drainage. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course with fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast. He was intubated and received antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia, but his respiratory distress persisted. He was extubated, but developed yeast bacteremia with positive urine and blood cultures. He has been treated with fluconazole and has ongoing fevers, tachycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Mucous plugging and secretions leading to respiratory distress
2. Pulmonary edema
3. Yeast bloodstream infection with potential for sepsis and organ dysfunction
4. Hyperdynamic state with tachycardia and potential for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
5. Anemia and bleeding due to gastrointestinal bleeding and potential for further bleeding
6. Liver lesion with potential for ischemia, infarction, or abscess
7. Left humeral fracture with potential for further injury or complications
8. SMV thrombus with potential for further complications if not anticoagulated
9. Seizure disorder with potential for seizure activity with certain antibiotics
10. Cerebral palsy with potential for ongoing cognitive and motor dysfunction

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for yeast bloodstream infection with fluconazole
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction
3. Consider non-invasive pressure ventilation if respiratory distress persists
4. Continue gentle diuresis with lasix to manage fluid overload
5. Monitor for signs of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
6. Trend Hct and monitor for signs of anemia and bleeding
7. Consider further evaluation of liver lesion with imaging and biopsy
8. Monitor for signs of further complications from SMV thrombus
9. Continue anticonvulsant therapy for seizure disorder
10. Monitor for signs of ongoing cognitive and motor dysfunction in cerebral palsy."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, including fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast. He was intubated and treated for pneumonia, but remains intubated due to respiratory distress likely caused by mucous plugging and secretions. He has a yeast bloodstream infection, and his urine and blood cultures are growing yeast.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Mucous plugging and secretions: The patient's respiratory distress is likely caused by mucous plugging and secretions, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
2. Yeast bloodstream infection: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death if not treated effectively.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be contributing to his respiratory distress, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by hyperdynamic state due to fever and infection, which can lead to cardiac complications such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion may be caused by ischemia, infarction, or abscess, which can lead to liver failure and death if not treated effectively.
6. Left humeral fracture: The patient's left humeral fracture may require surgical intervention to prevent further complications.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient's SMV thrombus may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent further complications.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may require close monitoring and adjustments to his medication regimen to prevent seizures.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may require ongoing management and therapy to prevent complications and improve his quality of life.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications due to his complex medical history, multiple comorbidities, and ongoing infections. Close monitoring and prompt management of his condition are essential to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to goal -500cc
   - change pantoprazole from IV to PO to limit amount of IVF
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - daily blood cultures
   - TTE
   - pull picc line and arterial line pending obtainment of new central
   access
   - d/c fluconazone for micafungin pending speciation
   - foley catheter changed overnight

   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - drug levels stable as of [**3-31**], continue to monitor
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst drainage. He was admitted with abdominal pain and developed a complicated course, including multilobar pneumonia, pleural effusions, and yeast bacteremia. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl, and has been intubated and extubated multiple times. Currently, he is experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and fevers, and is being treated with oxygen therapy, suction, and diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient's blood and urine cultures are growing yeast, which may indicate a urogenital source with hematogenous spread. This could lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, or dissemination of the infection.
2. Mucous Plugging and Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging and secretions, which could worsen if not managed promptly. This could lead to respiratory failure, pneumothorax, or other respiratory complications.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be contributing to his respiratory distress and could worsen if not managed. This could lead to cardiac failure, respiratory failure, or other complications.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may be triggered by certain antibiotics or other medications, which could lead to seizure activity, brain damage, or other complications.
5. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may be exacerbated by his current medical condition, leading to further neurological compromise or cognitive decline.
6. Liver Lesion: The patient's liver lesion may be indicative of liver failure, abscess, or infarction, which could lead to liver failure, bleeding, or other complications.
7. Left Humeral Fracture: The patient's left humeral fracture may be complicated by the patient's underlying medical condition, leading to further pain, swelling, or other complications.
8. SMV Thrombus: The patient's SMV thrombus may be complicated by the patient's underlying medical condition, leading to further bleeding, infarction, or other complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment is ongoing, and his plan is being adjusted accordingly. He is being treated with antibiotics, oxygen therapy, suction, and diuresis, and his central line and arterial line are being maintained. He will continue to be monitored for further complications, and his treatment plan will be adjusted as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, recurrent aspiration, and prolonged aspiration. He has been experiencing respiratory failure and has been receiving respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 111 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 87/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.7-8.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.2-26.5%
* Platelet count: 189-147 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 139-105 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 147 mEq/L, K 3.9 mEq/L, Cl 28 mEq/L, Ca 7.3 mg/dL, Mg 1.8 mg/dL, PO4 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes a seizure disorder, and he is currently being treated with micafungin for a yeast bacteremia from his PIC line. He also has a history of recurrent aspiration and prolonged aspiration.

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light)
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: Trace, Left lower extremity edema: Trace
* Neurologic: Attentive, not following simple commands, responds to verbal commands, but not assessed for movement, tone, or reflexes

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's yeast bacteremia and prolonged aspiration may lead to sepsis.
* Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration and prolonged aspiration may lead to pneumonia.
* DVT: The patient's prolonged immobility and respiratory failure may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
* VAP: The patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, leading to seizures.
* Skin breakdown: The patient's prolonged immobility and respiratory failure may increase the risk of skin breakdown.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to continue pulmonary toilette and diuresis, remove the PIC line, and attempt to place a peripheral IV through ultrasound guidance. The patient's medications will be adjusted as needed, and he will be monitored closely for any signs of worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications."

   TTE:
   IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets
   with moderate to severe stenosis. At least moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the
   anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) which appears consistent
   with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification; however,
   a small vegetation cannot be excluded. Mild global biventricular
   hypokinesis.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-3-25**], the
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets
   with moderate to severe stenosis. At least moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the
   anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) which appears consistent
   with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification; however,
   a small vegetation cannot be excluded. Mild global biventricular
   hypokinesis.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-3-25**], the
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity

   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to hyperdynamic state in the setting of fever and infection.
	* Mild global biventricular hypokinesis noted on trans-thoracic echocardiogram.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Mucous plugging and secretions contributing to respiratory distress.
	* Pulmonary edema may also be contributing to respiratory distress.
	* Need for non-invasive pressure ventilation may arise if respiratory distress persists.
3. Infection-related complications:
	* Yeast bloodstream infection with possible urogenital source and hematogenous spread.
	* Risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
	* Need for continued antifungal therapy and monitoring of blood cultures.
4. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia and bleeding risk due to gastrointestinal bleeding and possible liver lesion.
	* Need for transfusion and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels.
5. Neurological complications:
	* Seizure disorder with potential for seizure activity due to certain antibiotics.
	* Need for close monitoring of seizure activity and potential transition to oral anticonvulsants.
6. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastritis and possible liver lesion.
	* Need for close monitoring of stool guaiac and abdominal ultrasound.
7. Liver-related complications:
	* Possible liver abscess or infarction due to liver lesion.
	* Need for close monitoring of liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound.
8. Other complications:
	* Risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) due to PICC line.
	* Need for close monitoring of central line site and blood cultures.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple complications due to their complex medical history, ongoing infections, and multiple comorbidities. Close monitoring and prompt management of these complications are essential to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

   TTE:
   IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets
   with moderate to severe stenosis. At least moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the
   anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) which appears consistent
   with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification; however,
   a small vegetation cannot be excluded. Mild global biventricular
   hypokinesis.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-3-25**], the
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - check drug levels
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and was found to have multilobar pneumonia with MRSA, which was treated with antibiotics. He developed a yeast bloodstream infection and was started on micafungin. He has been experiencing fevers, hypoxemia, and tachycardia, and has been treated with Lasix for fluid overload. He has also been diagnosed with a liver lesion, a left humeral fracture, and a Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection and fevers increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and tachypnea may indicate respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and depressed cardiac function may indicate cardiac complications, such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent transfusion of packed red blood cells increase the risk of hemorrhage.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver lesion and recent transfusion of blood products may increase the risk of liver failure.
6. Infection: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection and recent antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of secondary infections.
7. Pancreatic complications: The patient's pancreatic cyst and recent drainage may increase the risk of pancreatic complications, such as pancreatitis.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure disorder and recent antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent transfusion of blood products may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for the yeast bloodstream infection with micafungin.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including pulse oximetry and peak flow readings.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider liver biopsy if the lesion is not resolved.
6. Monitor the patient's blood counts and consider transfusion of blood products if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including seizure activity and mental status.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely, including bowel movements and abdominal pain.
9. Consider prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP to prevent secondary infections."

   TTE:
   IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets
   with moderate to severe stenosis. At least moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Small echodensity in the left atrium adjacent to the
   anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) which appears consistent
   with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification; however,
   a small vegetation cannot be excluded. Mild global biventricular
   hypokinesis.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-3-25**], the
   findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even to
   -500cc negative
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress x 1 to see if helpful
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have fevers, now with
   positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital
   source with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure
   currently at baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - check drug levels
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - change pantoprazole to PO
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - check drug levels
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI
   ACCESS: PICC, A-line in right brachial artery

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and later developed fever, hypoxemia, and blood cultures growing yeast.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient has been intubated and extubated, and currently has rhonchorous breath sounds on exam, suggesting mucous plugging and secretions. He is being treated with suction and light chest PT, and is being considered for non-invasive pressure ventilation.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has tachycardia, likely due to fever and infection. His cardiac function is depressed, and there is a possibility of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, which is being managed with transfusions and iron supplements. He has also had recent gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.
* Neurological status: The patient has a seizure disorder, which is being managed with medication. He is also nonverbal and has a stable mental status.
* Infectious status: The patient has a yeast bloodstream infection, which is being treated with micafungin. He also has positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has had recent gastrointestinal bleeding and has a possible liver lesion on abdominal CT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further intervention to manage his respiratory distress.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's depressed cardiac function and tachycardia may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia make him at risk for further bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
* Infection: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection and positive urine and blood cultures growing yeast make him at risk for further infection and sepsis.
* Liver failure: The patient's possible liver lesion on abdominal CT may lead to liver failure, which could be life-threatening.
* Neurological complications: The patient's seizure disorder and nonverbal status make him at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or brain injury.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical history. The patient has undergone various procedures, including arterial line placement, paracentesis, and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE).

The TTE revealed moderately thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets with moderate to severe stenosis, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation. A small vegetation was noted in the left atrium adjacent to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, which may be consistent with artifact from mitral annular and valvular calcification, but a small vegetation cannot be excluded.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated, indicating potential insulin resistance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 26 mmHg.

The patient has a central line and a peripheral line in place, and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's vegetation in the left atrium adjacent to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve may indicate endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications if left untreated.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
3. Insulin resistance: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate potential insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and diabetic nephropathy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and PaO2 may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
5. Septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood cultures may indicate sepsis, which can lead to septic shock, organ failure, and death if left untreated.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's moderate to severe aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation may indicate cardiac failure, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of arrhythmias, and decreased peripheral perfusion.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old man with cerebral palsy, respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. He has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure with valvular disease and has undergone paracentesis with no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently receiving diuresis for pulmonary edema and micafungin for suspected fungemia. The patient's fever curve has slightly improved, and he is being followed up on PIC tip culture and peritoneal fluid analysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management. He is receiving oxygen therapy, but his respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's suspected fungemia and aspiration pneumonia increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, failure, and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure with valvular disease puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure exacerbation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's cerebral palsy and seizure disorder increase his risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and neurologic deterioration.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's aspiration pneumonia and possible gastrointestinal bleeding increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation, and sepsis.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance, as evidenced by his low blood pressure, high heart rate, and abnormal laboratory values, increases his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's PIC line and peritoneal catheter increase his risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
8. Renal failure: The patient's fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance increase his risk of renal failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
9. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and possible liver dysfunction increase his risk of liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and death.
10. Multi-organ failure: The patient's critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction increase his risk of multi-organ failure, which can lead to death."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT as tolerated
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV for TBB -500ml today
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress as needed
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have low grade fevers, now
   with positive blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital source
   with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure currently at
   baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - lines removed and replaced
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV per ID day 1 = [**4-2**]
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG while on micafungin
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast. Repeat cultures of
   blood, urine ngtd.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct qd
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - PO pantoprazole
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - Drug levels wnl on [**4-3**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation: advance diet
   .
   # Case Management
 likely d/c to rehab tomorrow.
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today; cleared for nectar thick liquids,
   pureed solids; needs 1:1 observation (mother may need to feed). OK to
   try crushed meds, but may not take reliably
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI, restart SC heparin
   ACCESS: PIV
   CODE: DNR/DNI. No CPR or defibrillation. Will clarify role for
   BIPAP/CPAP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and pancreatic cyst. He was admitted with abdominal pain and has had a complicated course with fever, hypoxemia, and blood culture growing yeast.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Hypoxemia: Multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, which has been treated with a 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
2. Yeast bacteremia: Positive blood cultures growing yeast, likely due to a urogenital source with hematogenous spread.
3. Fever: Daily low-grade febrile episodes despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection, with evidence of depressed cardiac function on echocardiogram, possibly indicating tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Anemia/bleed: Stable Hct, with a history of GIB, RP bleed, and CT evidence of hemorrhage into the bowel wall.
6. Liver lesion: Possible ischemia/infarction vs abscess, with an abdominal ultrasound not consistent with abscess.
7. Left humeral fx: Likely due to trauma sustained during radiology.
8. SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation for 6 months, but held in setting of recent GI and RP bleed.
9. Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures, but caution as certain antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
10. Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status, with interactive but nonverbal behavior at baseline.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for yeast bloodstream infection, pneumonia, and GIB. He is being monitored for sepsis, and his condition is being closely followed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection and pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and possible tachycardia-induced arrhythmias may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and recent RP bleed may lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver lesion may lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's yeast bloodstream infection and pneumonia may lead to infection-related complications, such as abscesses or empyema.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure disorder and possible tachycardia-induced arrhythmias may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
8. Thrombotic complications: The patient's SMV thrombus may lead to thrombotic complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for yeast bloodstream infection and pneumonia.
2. Anti-fungal therapy for yeast bloodstream infection.
3. Pain management for GIB and possible liver lesion.
4. Anticoagulation for SMV thrombus.
5. Seizure management for seizure disorder.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding management.
7. Respiratory support for pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema.
8. Monitoring for sepsis and cardiac complications.

The patient's condition will need to be closely monitored, and his treatment plan will need to be adjusted as necessary to prevent potential medical complications and optimize his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo M with PMH of CP, seizure disorder, GIB, pancreatic cyst s/p
   drainage in [**2113**], admitted with abdominal pain with complicated course
   now with fever, hypoxemia, blood culture growing yeast.
   .
   # Hypoxemia:   Patient transferred to MICU with tachypnea and hypoxia
   on [**2115-3-23**] and intubated on [**2115-3-24**].  Imaging findings consistent with
   multilobar pneumonia with sputum growing MRSA, complted 8 day course of
   vanc, cefepime, and flagyl on [**2115-3-31**]. Pleural effusions also noted on
   imaging, likely due to fluid resuscitation for hypotension in the
   setting of albumin of 2.3, so have been diuresing with lasix boluses.
   Extubated on [**2115-3-30**].  The current respiratory distress is likely due
   to mucous plugging, secretions with rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
   Pulmonary edema may also be contributing.
   - suction and light chest PT as tolerated
   - continue gentle diuresis with lasix 40mg IV boluses to go even as
   patient appears slightly dry on exam
   - follow ABGs
   - morphine for grunting/resp distress as needed
   - will discuss non-invasive pressure ventilation if necessary with
   family
   .
   # Yeast bacteremia:  Patient continues to have low grade fevers, now
   with positive blood cultures growing yeast.  Possible urogenital source
   with hematogenous spread.  Heart rate and blood pressure currently at
   baseline.  Normal WBC count, lactate.
   - follow fever curve
   - lines removed and replaced
   - daily blood cultures
   - follow speciation and sensitivity
   - continue micafungin IV per ID day 1 = [**4-2**]
   - f/u ID recs
   - follow LFT, EKG
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - f/u aspergillus, beta glucan
   .
   #Fevers:  Patient daily low grade febrile episodes despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Completed treatment for pulmonary infection with
   8 day course of vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl.  SBP possible but 3 taps
   have not been c/w SBP.  PE considered but no evidence on CTA.  CT read
   as possible liver abscess but repeat RUQ ultrasound read as more
   consistent with infarct.  C. Diff has been negative.  Overnight
   positive urine and blood culture growing yeast. Repeat cultures of
   blood, urine ngtd.
   - treatment for yeast bloodstream infection as above
   -
   # Tachycardia: Likely hyperdynamic in setting of fever, infection.
   Volume status appears grossly euvolemic; pt mentating at baseline and
   maintaining urine output.  Echo with evidence of depressed cardiac fxn,
   ? tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
   - Tylenol prn fever
   - Antimicrobial agents as above
   .
   # Anemia/bleed: Hct stable. Pt with RP bleed and CT evidence of
   hemorrhage into bowel wall, also gastric varices c/b GIB earlier in
   admission. Transfused 1 unit pRBCs [**3-25**] with appropriate bump and has
   remained stable since.
   - Trend Hct qd
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&S
   - PO pantoprazole
   - Continue iron supplement
   # Liver lesion. Noted on abdominal CT. Possible ischemia/infarction vs
   abscess. Abdominal U/S [**3-27**] not consistent with abscess.
   .
   # Left humeral fx: Likely d/t trauma sustained during radiology.
   - No surgical indication at this time
   - Pain control with lidoderm patch and morphine prn
   .
   # SMV thrombus: Plan for anticoagulation x 6 months but held in setting
   of recent GI and RP bleed.
   - Continue heparin SQ???
   .
   # Seizure disorder: No recent reports of seizures. Caution as certain
   antibiotics may lower seizure threshold.
   - Continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin, but transition to PO route
   - Drug levels wnl on [**4-3**]
   .
   # Cerebral palsy: Stable mental status.  Interactive with family but
   nonverbal at baseline.
   - speech and swallow evaluation: advance diet
   .
   FEN: continue tube feeds today; cleared for nectar thick liquids,
   pureed solids; needs 1:1 observation (mother may need to feed). OK to
   try crushed meds, but may not take reliably
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PO PPI
   ACCESS: PIV
   CODE: Do not resuscitate/Do not re-intubate. No CPR or defibrillation.
   Will clarify role for BIPAP/CPAP.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to mucous plugging, secretions, and pulmonary edema. This may lead to further decline in oxygenation and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
2. Yeast bloodstream infection: The patient's blood culture growing yeast is a concerning finding, and the possibility of urogenital source with hematogenous spread should be further investigated. This may lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased mortality.
3. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's tachycardia may be contributing to depressed cardiac function, which could worsen cardiac output and increase the risk of cardiac failure.
4. Anemia and bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent bleeding episodes may increase the risk of further bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion, possibly due to ischemia or infarction, may progress to liver failure, which could have significant implications for the patient's overall health.
6. Left humeral fracture: The patient's recent fracture may lead to further complications, such as infection, nonunion, or malunion, which could impact the patient's mobility and overall quality of life.
7. SMV thrombus: The patient's SMV thrombus may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen with certain antibiotics, which could lead to increased seizure frequency or severity.
9. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may impact their ability to communicate and interact with their environment, which could worsen their overall quality of life.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with cerebral palsy, respiratory failure, and a history of seizure disorder. He has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving diuresis treatment. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/66 mmHg. His respiratory status has improved, with a SpO2 of 96% and a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination is notable for trace edema in both lower extremities, soft and non-tender abdomen, and clear breath sounds. His neurologic examination is abnormal, with the patient being non-attentive, not following simple commands, and not oriented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.3, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 137 K/uL. Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation studies, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's medical conditions include fever, seizure disorder, alteration in nutrition, tachycardia, anemia, and respiratory failure. His plan of care includes continued diuresis, restarting heparin, and considering removing the nasogastric tube if he is eating adequately.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and he may require further transfusions to correct his anemia.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder is a risk factor for further seizures, and he may require anticonvulsant therapy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nasogastric tube may cause gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, if not properly managed.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions may increase his risk of developing venous thromboembolism.
7. Wound complications: The patient's respiratory failure and anemia may increase his risk of developing wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections."
