   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG (7.37, 50, 20), Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: PO cardiac diet as tolerated
   Glycemic Control: None
   Lines: PIV x 2
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: : Heparin SQ TID
   Stress ulcer: Not on PPI at home, though should be while on high dose
   steroids
   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband
   does not answer the phone regularly)
   Code status:  DNR/DNI. We discussed at length how patient
s chances of
   coming off the ventilator would be very low. She has had discussed her
   wishes at length with her family, as she would not want measures to
   prolong
the inevitable.
   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded

   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, presenting with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening metastatic disease.
* The patient requires nonrebreather due to hypoxia and has persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which is contributing to her poor forward flow and hypotension.
* The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, polymyalgia rheumatica, coronary artery disease, gout, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* The patient is on various medications, including anticoagulation, antibiotics, steroids, and cardiac medications.
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which have improved with IV fluid administration, and her cardiac enzymes are negative.
* The patient's imaging studies show worsening multifocal pneumonia, pleural effusion, and metastatic disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening multifocal pneumonia and pleural effusion can lead to further respiratory compromise, requiring increased ventilator support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Cardiac complications: The patient's persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
* Sepsis: The patient's underlying infections, including pneumonia and pleural effusion, can lead to sepsis, which can further compromise her respiratory and cardiac status.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and history of gastrointestinal bleeding can increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly with anticoagulation therapy.
* Metastatic disease progression: The patient's worsening metastatic disease can lead to further organ compromise, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
* Infection control issues: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory failure increase her risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and address potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u cultures,
   continue levoflox.
   COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   Goal sats 90-94%.
   Will hold off diuresis in setting
   Will check
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u cultures,
   continue levoflox.
   COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   Goal sats 90-94%.
   Will hold off diuresis in setting
   Will check
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, who presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening metastatic disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires non-rebreather oxygen therapy. There is a risk of further deterioration, which can lead to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor forward flow, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest. The patient's blood pressure is also labile, which can exacerbate cardiac instability.
3. Infection: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Bleeding: The patient has anemia, which can be exacerbated by further bleeding. The patient's platelet count is also low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, which can be exacerbated by further volume depletion or decreased cardiac output.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is on high-dose steroids, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, or perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of brain metastases, which can lead to neurological deficits or seizures.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has coronary artery disease, which can lead to myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
9. Metastatic disease: The patient has worsening metastatic disease, which can lead to further organ dysfunction or failure.
10. Inadequate oxygenation: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on non-rebreather oxygen therapy, which may not be sufficient to meet her oxygen demands.

To address these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, aggressive management of her respiratory and cardiac status, and treatment of any underlying infections or bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose

   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Will be on increased steroids for ? amio
   toxicity.
   #) Coronary artery disease: CE
s neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**], a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, is admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening disease on CT chest. She requires nonrebreather oxygen due to hypoxia and has a history of atrial fibrillation with recent RVR. Her vital signs are stable, but she has decreased breath sounds and rales on the left base, and bronchial breath sounds on the right lung field.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires nonrebreather oxygen. The worsening disease on CT chest and multifocal pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is unstable, and she has a history of RVR. This increases the risk of poor forward flow, hypotension, and cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, and the differential diagnosis includes PCP, amiodarone-induced toxicity, and aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy. The risk of sepsis is high, and the patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she has a history of hypotension. The etiology is multifactorial, and the risk of sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiac event is high.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and the risk of bleeding is high. The patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
6. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and her creatinine is currently normal. However, the risk of worsening renal function is high, and the patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
7. Amiodarone Toxicity: The patient is taking amiodarone, and the risk of toxicity is high. The patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
8. Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma: The patient has a history of squamous cell lung carcinoma, and the risk of progression is high. The patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with amiodarone and metoprolol, and consider alternative rate control measures.
3. Perform a bronchoscopy to evaluate for PCP and amiodarone-induced toxicity.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Perform a guaiac stool test to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic renal insufficiency and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's amiodarone toxicity and adjust treatment as needed.
9. Consult with oncology to discuss the patient's long-term plan and potential chemotherapy regimens.
10. Consider palliative care and social work consults to support the patient and her family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications as needed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated troponin-T levels, indicating potential cardiac damage. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Physical examination is limited due to the patient's unstable condition, and neurologic examination is not assessable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and increased risk of pneumonia.
2. Cardiac damage: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest potential cardiac damage, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of cardiac death.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which can worsen his condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and potential cardiac damage increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to life-threatening complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly low potassium level can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness, which can worsen his condition.
6. DVT: The patient's prophylactic heparin sodium treatment increases the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.

Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are essential to prevent these complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG, Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, who presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening disease and multifocal pneumonia. She has persistently required nonrebreather due to hypoxia and has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) leading to poor forward flow without atrial kick.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds over the left base with rales present, scattered wheezes upon expiration, and a left supraclavicular ill-defined mass. Her laboratory results show anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, polymyalgia rheumatica, coronary artery disease, gout, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute. Her SpO2 is 96% on nonrebreather.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial, with a large component attributed to atrial fibrillation with RVR, poor forward flow without atrial kick, and poor lung reserve.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with contributions from poor forward flow from atrial fibrillation with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely due to her history of this condition and is currently asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
4. Chest Discomfort: The patient's chest discomfort is likely secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or post-nasal pneumonia, and is being managed with hydromorphone.
5. Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma: The patient's squamous cell lung carcinoma is being managed by her oncologists, and she may require further chemotherapy regimens.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to dilution (+1.5L) and is being managed with type and cross active, slow transfusion (EF 50%), and guaiac stools.
7. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is being managed by monitoring her creatinine trend and appropriately renally dosing medications.
8. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: The patient's polymyalgia rheumatica is being managed with a steroid taper per outpatient regimen.
9. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is being managed with continued home aspirin and restarted beta blocker.
10. Gout: The patient's gout is being managed with continued allopurinol at home dose.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to poor forward flow, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's multifocal pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and polymyalgia rheumatica may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
7. Infection: The patient's multifocal pneumonia may lead to infection, which can worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG (7.37, 50, 20), Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose

   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No

   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG (7.37, 50, 20), Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 69-year-old female with a history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening lung disease. She has been requiring nonrebreather oxygen due to hypoxia and has a persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds over the left base with rales, scattered wheezes upon expiration, and a non-tender, ill-defined mass in the left supraclavicular area. Her cardiac examination is regular, with no rubs or gallops. Her abdomen is soft, and her extremities are warm, with clubbing present along the distal interphalangeal joints.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.2-4.4 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 7.7-7.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 115-95 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.3-0.02 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.7 mg/dL
* Cortisol: 42.2 μg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Dyspnea/hypoxia: likely multifactorial, with suspected large component secondary to AFib with RVR leading to poor forward flow and backup into the lungs.
* Hypotension: likely multifactorial, with contribution from poor forward flow from AFib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia.
* Atrial fibrillation: patient presented to ED in AFib with RVR, and was previously maintained on PO amiodarone and metoprolol. She was reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but is now again in AFib RVR.
* Chest discomfort: patient describes atypical left chest wall pain, which could be secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA.
* Squamous cell lung carcinoma: patient is followed by oncologists and has worsening pulmonary disease. Further chemotherapy regimens may not be available due to poor response and poor tolerance of first-line chemotherapy.
* Anemia: baseline in mid-20s, with a drop since admission. Type and cross active, and consider slow transfusion.
* Chronic renal insufficiency: patient's baseline creatinine is 1.1-1.2, and currently her creatinine is better than baseline at 0.8.
* Polymyalgia rheumatica: continue steroid taper per outpatient regimen.
* Coronary artery disease: continue home aspirin and restarted beta-blocker.
* Gout: continue allopurinol at home dose.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: the patient's worsening lung disease and pneumonia may lead to further respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
* Infection: the patient's pneumonia and chronic respiratory failure may increase her risk of infection.
* Bleeding: the patient's anemia and chronic renal insufficiency may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Metastatic disease: the patient's squamous cell lung carcinoma may spread to other parts of her body, leading to metastatic disease.
* Pneumothorax: the patient's worsening lung disease and pneumonia may lead to pneumothorax.
* Pulmonary embolism: the patient's chronic respiratory failure and pneumonia may increase her risk of pulmonary embolism.
* Heart failure: the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and chronic respiratory failure may lead to heart failure.

Based on this assessment, the patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Close monitoring of her respiratory status and blood pressure
* Administration of oxygen therapy as needed
* Management of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Treatment of her pneumonia and chronic respiratory failure
* Monitoring of her anemia and chronic renal insufficiency
* Management of her polymyalgia rheumatica and coronary artery disease
* Monitoring for signs of infection, bleeding, and metastatic disease
* Consideration of bronchoscopy and palliative stenting for post-obstructive pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]

   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8556**] has had progressive decline in her breathing with
   worsening O2 needs and now development of Afib/ RVR in setting of

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Will be on increased steroids for ? amio
   toxicity.
   #) Coronary artery disease: CE
s neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: PO cardiac diet as tolerated
   Glycemic Control: None
   Lines: PIV x 2
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: : Heparin SQ TID
   Stress ulcer: Not on PPI at home, though should be while on high dose
   steroids
   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband
   does not answer the phone regularly)
   Code status:  DNR/DNI. We discussed at length how patient
s chances of
   coming off the ventilator would be very low. She has had discussed her
   wishes at length with her family, as she would not want measures to
   prolong
the inevitable.
   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8556**] has had progressive decline in her breathing with
   worsening O2 needs and now development of Afib/ RVR in setting of
   hypoxemia. She denies cough or hemoptyis or chest pain either.

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**], a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, worsening multifocal pneumonia, and worsening metastatic disease. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has worsened with recent chest CT scans showing multifocal pneumonia. Her current condition is characterized by hypoxia, requiring nonrebreather oxygen, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with worsening hypoxia and multifocal pneumonia. There is a high risk of further deterioration, which may lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
3. Infections: The patient's multifocal pneumonia may be caused by various pathogens, including PCP, amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, or other atypical infections. There is a risk of further infection, particularly if the patient is not adequately treated.
4. Metastatic disease: The patient's worsening metastatic disease may lead to further complications, such as spinal cord compression, bowel obstruction, or other symptoms.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, infection, or other underlying conditions.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen due to dehydration, infection, or other underlying conditions.
7. Gout: The patient's gout may worsen due to the use of high-dose steroids.

Plan:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive nonrebreather oxygen and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if her respiratory status deteriorates further.
2. Cardiac management: The patient will receive antiarrhythmic medications to control her atrial fibrillation, and her cardiac rhythm will be closely monitored.
3. Infection control: The patient will receive empiric antibiotics for suspected infections, and further testing will be done to determine the causative organism.
4. Metastatic disease management: The patient will be managed with palliative care and social work consults to address her symptoms and quality of life.
5. Anemia management: The patient will receive blood transfusions as needed to manage her anemia.
6. Renal insufficiency management: The patient will receive close monitoring of her renal function and will be managed with diuretics and other medications as needed.
7. Gout management: The patient will receive allopurinol to manage her gout.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with
   dyspnea, with CT chest concerning for worsening disease and multifocal
   pneumonia.
   .
   #) Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large component was
   secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor forward flow
   without atrial kick (discussed below). CT also demonstrated multi-focal
   pneumonia, though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this;
   a post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could
   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung
   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would
   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A
   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is
   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.
   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any
   significant edema.
   - Trend lactate, VBG
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG now
   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   discuss further broadening coverage.
   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until
   stable heart rate for a few more hours)
   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was
   more likely due to AF with RVR
   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and
   dyspnea not improve with above measures
   .
   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow
   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal
   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and
   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities
   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT
   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output
   - Checking random cortisol, initiating stress dose steroids given
   chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses
   - Expand antibiotic coverage
   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin
   given demand of RVR
   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already
   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She
   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not
   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately
   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.
   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension
   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated. She reports she had a 12
   unit GIB in the past due to diverticulosis, so anti-coagulation has
   been held since that time.
   .
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of
   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).
   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to
   assist with volume repletion.
   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need
   volume and/or become symptomatic.
   .
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   .
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed
   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she
   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she
   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her
   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.
   - Stress dose steroids
   .
   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG
   - Will cycle enzymes
   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)
   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.
   - Repeat EKG
   .
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.
   .
   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet. No need for
   further IVF, given she appears euvolemic. Electrolytes WNL.
   .
   #) PPx: Heparin SQ TID, PPI, bowel regimen as needed
   .
   #) Contact: [**Name (NI) 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband does
   not answer the phone regularly)
   .
   #) Code: Full, however patient reports she has discussed her wishes at
   length with her family. She would want initial efforts at
   resuscitation, however would not want support.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening lung disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/60 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. Her respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask, and she is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pneumonia, and worsening underlying lung disease. Monitoring her oxygen saturation and adjusting her respiratory support as needed is crucial.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a significant concern, and monitoring her cardiac enzymes and adjusting her anticoagulation therapy as needed is important. Additionally, her history of coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency may increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient's multifocal pneumonia and possible post-obstructive pneumonia increase her risk of infection. Monitoring her temperature, white blood cell count, and blood cultures is important, and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed is crucial.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to poor forward flow from atrial fibrillation, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or medication effect. Monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting her fluid therapy and medication as needed is important.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her underlying chronic disease or acute blood loss. Monitoring her hemoglobin and adjusting her transfusion therapy as needed is important.
6. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may increase her risk of acute kidney injury. Monitoring her creatinine and adjusting her fluid therapy and medication as needed is important.
7. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: The patient's polymyalgia rheumatica may be exacerbating her symptoms. Monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her steroid therapy as needed is important.
8. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may increase her risk of cardiac complications. Monitoring her EKG and adjusting her medication as needed is important.
9. Gout: The patient's gout may be exacerbated by her acute illness. Monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her medication as needed is important.

Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support and monitoring of oxygen saturation.
2. Monitor cardiac enzymes and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and monitor for signs of infection.
4. Monitor blood pressure and adjust fluid therapy and medication as needed.
5. Monitor hemoglobin and adjust transfusion therapy as needed.
6. Monitor creatinine and adjust fluid therapy and medication as needed.
7. Monitor symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica and adjust steroid therapy as needed.
8. Monitor EKG and adjust medication as needed.
9. Monitor for signs of gout and adjust medication as needed.
10. Continue stress dose steroids for acute illness.
11. Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.
12. Consider repeat CT chest to assess for worsening lung disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69-year-old female with a complex medical history, including squamous cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and chronic respiratory failure. She presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure, multifocal pneumonia, and worsening disease on CT chest.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/60 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals loud crackles and bronchial breath sounds in the right lung base, and loud crackles in the left lower lobe. Her abdomen is soft, and she has no edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.4, hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 95. Her creatinine level is below baseline, and her troponin level is 0.02 ng/mL.

The patient's diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia, worsening squamous cell lung carcinoma, and chronic respiratory failure. She is being treated empirically for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) with bactrim and levofloxacin, and her steroids are being continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening lung disease and pneumonia may lead to further respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and worsening lung disease may lead to sepsis, which could result in organ dysfunction and death.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's steroid use and hypotension may indicate adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this complication.
6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level is below baseline, which may indicate worsening kidney function. Monitoring and management of kidney function are necessary to prevent further decline.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.1 g/dL, which may indicate anemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this complication.

In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a complex patient with multiple medical conditions, including squamous cell carcinoma, atrial fibrillation, and chronic respiratory failure. She is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac complications, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and anemia. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of pneumonia, and the radiographic infiltrates are progressive and interstitial, suggesting possible infection or malignancy. The patient declines bronchoscopy, which would require intubation.

The patient is currently on metoprolol for rate control, and there is concern about bradycardia. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and IV fluids have been administered to resolve hypotension. The patient has anemia, which is suspected to be related to malignancy, and thrombocytopenia, which may be caused by heparin or malignancy.

The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT, H2 blocker for stress ulcer, and HOB elevation for VAP prevention. The patient has a code status of DNI (do not intubate) and is dispositioned to the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's progressive radiographic infiltrates and interstitial pneumonia may lead to worsening respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may progress to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Malignancy: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be related to underlying malignancy, which can worsen their condition and reduce their quality of life.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and bradycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and mortality.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase their risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE  -- progressive radiographic infiltrates,
   predominately interstitial.  Concerns include infection (ex viral,
   PcP), malignancy (progressive).  Patient declines bronchoscopy, which
   would require intubation.  Plan to empirically treat with
   antimicrobials.
   A-FIB -- Currently rate controlled.  monitor HR.
   BRADYCARDIA -- use beta-blocker prn to keep HR <120.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved with iv fluids.  Possible component of adernal
   insufficiency.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ANEMIA -- malignancy.  No evidence for acute blood loss.  Transfuse to
   Hct >25.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- medication (heparin), malignancy.  Monitor.
   CRI -- at baseline.  Monitor BUN, creat.
   PMR -- continue steroids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress, pneumonia, and other comorbidities. The note highlights the patient's progressive radiographic infiltrates, predominantly interstitial, which may be due to infection (viral or PcP) or malignancy. The patient declines bronchoscopy, which would require intubation.

The patient is receiving various medications, including metoprolol for tachycardia, heparin for prophylaxis, and antibiotics for empiric treatment of pneumonia. The note also mentions the patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 134/69 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on non-rebreather oxygen.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, with a normal cardiovascular examination, except for a possible component of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's neurological examination is also normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 g/dL, hemoglobin of 91 K/uL, platelet count of 95, and troponin-T of 0.02. The patient's glucose level is 95 mg/dL, and their creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's progressive radiographic infiltrates and respiratory distress increase the risk of respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and possible viral or PcP infection may lead to sepsis, which can result in multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's possible component of adrenal insufficiency may lead to hypotension, which can be life-threatening.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not addressed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient requires invasive procedures or surgery.
6. Malignancy: The patient's possible malignancy may lead to further complications, such as organ dysfunction or failure, and may require additional treatment.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or other life-threatening complications.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's possible neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, may arise from the patient's underlying condition or treatment.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory distress, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."
