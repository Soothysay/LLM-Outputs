You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour events, the patient is experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and requires significant amounts of pain medication. The patient's blood pressure is in the 70's despite IV fluids, indicating a potential cardiovascular instability. The patient's heart rhythm is SVT, which may be contributing to the tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs, indicating possible pulmonary edema. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities are notable for left upper extremity edema and purple ecchymoses, suggesting potential trauma.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated troponin-T, suggesting potential cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's SVT and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can further compromise cardiac function.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure may indicate cardiac failure, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs may indicate pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory results may indicate infection, which can lead to sepsis and potential organ failure.
5. Neurological compromise: The patient's altered mental status and abnormal neurologic examination may indicate potential neurological compromise, which can lead to long-term disability or death.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's left upper extremity edema and purple ecchymoses may indicate potential trauma, which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
7. Aspiration: The patient's concern for aspiration due to altered mental status and inability to protect their airway may lead to respiratory failure.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
   1) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp
s in the 90
s on arrival to the floor, but
   despite 2.5L NS, sbp
s dropped to 60
s this AM. Patient asymptomatic,
   extremities warm, but concern is high for mild rhabdomyolysis after
   fall with elevated CE
s compounded by mild ischemia or possible
   infection given rising WBC. Given critical AS, it is challenging to
   hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.
   - Fluid replete as tolerates
   - Consider central line placement in case patient requires pressors
   .
   2) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Ibuprofen 600mg q8H:PRN
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 2-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   3) Critical AS/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Patient with previous valve
   area of 0.7cm^2 and has symptoms leading to poor prognososis from AS.
   She does not want surgery and has refused multiple medical options on
   this admission.  Will attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by
   treating pain, avoiding further hypotension, and trying to avoid more
   hypotension than necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF
   .
   4) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury, but lactate 2.6 this AM.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   5) Acute oliguric renal injury/CKD: Baseline Cr difficult to assess
   from labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context
   of appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in
   the past 24 hours.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No recent antibiotics or other
   nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with benign UA.
   -500 ml NS bolus this AM
   -Trend Cr
   -Avoid nephrotoxins
   6) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   7) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates
   .
   8) Rhythm: Patient in AF and not anticoagulated.  Unclear why she is
   not on aspirin though some mention of a previous GI bleed.  Will
   discuss with PCP and cardiologist tomorrow.
   -Restart metoprolol 25 mg TID as pressure allows
   -Hold anticoagulation for the moment

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis who presented to the ICU after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates. She is tachycardic, hypotensive, and requiring significant amounts of PO Dilaudid for pain management. Her blood pressure is labile, and she has bibasilar crackles on lung examination. Her labs show leukocytosis, anemia, and acute oliguric renal injury. She has a history of CAD but is not on ASA or statin therapy. She is in AF and not anticoagulated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and mild ischemia or possible infection may increase her risk of developing rhabdomyolysis.
2. Cardiogenic syncope: The patient's critical AS and unexplained fall may indicate cardiogenic syncope, which can lead to further hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric renal injury may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and rising WBC may indicate an underlying infection, which can worsen her condition if not treated promptly.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of radiation proctitis and recent fall may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen her anemia and hypotension.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's bibasilar crackles and labile blood pressure may indicate pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory status and overall condition.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient's critical AS and recent fall may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)."

s. Undoubtedly
   patient with poor end organ perfusion given low UOP, but as patient is
   asymptomatic, her sbp

   forward flow
   .
   3) Critical AS/LVH: Patient with previous valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has
   symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.  She does not want surgery
   and has refused multiple medical options on this admission.  Will
   attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by treating pain, avoiding
   further hypotension, and trying to avoid more hypotension than
   necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF & pain control
   - Revisit possibility of valvuloplasty with patient & family today with
   the help of outpatient PCP
   .
   4) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   .
   5) Elevated CE
s: Patient with elevated CK
s, Troponins, mildly
   elevated MBI in the context of increased demand. Patient without CP,
   SOB and elevation in enzymes likely due to mild ischemia from elevated
   HR and lower ventricular filling volumes.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat EKG this AM to ensure now changes
   - Restart Metoprolol as bp
s tolerate
   .
   6) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   .
   7) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   8) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates
   .
   9) Rhythm: Patient in AF and not anticoagulated. CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age). Unclear why she is not on aspirin though some
   mention of a previous GI bleed.  Will discuss with cardiologist today.
   -Restart Metoprolol 25 mg TID as pressure allows

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
   1) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   2) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp
s in the 90
s on arrival to the floor, but
   despite 2.5L NS, sbp
s dropped to 60
s this AM. Patient asymptomatic,
   extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained from the
   right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
s. Undoubtedly
   patient with poor end organ perfusion given low UOP, but as patient is
   asymptomatic, her sbp
s may be better than pressures obtained in the
   right arm indicate. Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Fluid replete as tolerates
   - Can consider central line placement in case patient requires
   pressors, but would opt to minimize SVR as this will only impair
   forward flow
   .
   3) Critical AS/LVH: Patient with previous valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has
   symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.  She does not want surgery
   and has refused multiple medical options on this admission.  Will
   attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by treating pain, avoiding
   further hypotension, and trying to avoid more hypotension than
   necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF & pain control
   - Revisit possibility of valvuloplasty with patient & family today with

   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the

   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented to the ICU after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension. She has a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), radiation proctitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She is tachycardic and hypotensive, requiring significant amounts of pain medication. She has a history of sensitivity to decreased preload and has refused surgical intervention for her AS. The patient's lab results show elevated troponin, CK, and CKMB levels, indicating possible myocardial injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further decline in cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Renal injury: The patient's acute oliguric renal injury may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's bibasilar crackles may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which can rapidly deteriorate if not addressed.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which can quickly spread and become life-threatening if not identified and treated promptly.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of radiation proctitis and CAD may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate decreased cerebral perfusion, which can lead to neurological deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Optimize pain control to reduce tachycardia and improve cardiac function.
2. Monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent further decline in cardiac function.
3. Continue to monitor and manage fluid balance to prevent further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Repeat echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and rule out further cardiac complications.
5. Consider central line placement for potential pressor support.
6. Reassess and adjust medication regimen to minimize workload on the ventricle and prevent further hypotension.
7. Continue to monitor and manage respiratory function to prevent further decline.
8. Reassess and adjust antibiotic therapy if signs of infection develop.
9. Consider gastrointestinal prophylaxis to prevent further bleeding.
10. Monitor and manage neurological function to prevent further deterioration."

   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   2) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp
s in the 90
s on arrival to the floor, but
   despite 2.5L NS, sbp
s dropped to 60
s this AM. Patient asymptomatic,
   extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained from the
   right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
s. Undoubtedly
   patient with poor end organ perfusion given low UOP, but as patient is
   asymptomatic, her sbp
s may be better than pressures obtained in the
   right arm indicate. Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Fluid replete as tolerates
   - Can consider central line placement in case patient requires
   pressors, but would opt to minimize SVR as this will only impair
   forward flow
   .
   3) Critical AS/LVH: Patient with previous valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has
   symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.  She does not want surgery
   and has refused multiple medical options on this admission.  Will
   attempt to minimize workload on ventricle by treating pain, avoiding
   further hypotension, and trying to avoid more hypotension than
   necessary.
   - Hold BB tonight given hypotension but will restart as soon as
   possible for rate control
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with IVF & pain control
   - Revisit possibility of valvuloplasty with patient & family today with
   the help of outpatient PCP
   .
   4) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   .
   5) Elevated CE
s: Patient with elevated CK
s, Troponins, mildly
   elevated MBI in the context of increased demand. Patient without CP,
   SOB and elevation in enzymes likely due to mild ischemia from elevated
   HR and lower ventricular filling volumes.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat EKG this AM to ensure now changes
   - Restart Metoprolol as bp
s tolerate
   .
   6) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   .
   7) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   8) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates
   .
   9) Rhythm: Patient in AF and not anticoagulated. CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age). Unclear why she is not on aspirin though some
   mention of a previous GI bleed.  Will discuss with cardiologist today.
   -Restart Metoprolol 25 mg TID as pressure allows
   -Hold anticoagulation for now

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
   1) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.

   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp

   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   2) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved with 3L NS & pressors with worsening tachycardia. Pressors
   were then held with sbp

   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has bibasilar crackles since early this AM.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), radiation proctitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the hospital after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiate administration. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and requires significant amounts of pain medication. She has refused surgical interventions, including valvuloplasty, and is being managed conservatively with a sling and analgesia.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Critical AS: The patient has a narrow aortic valve area, which is likely contributing to her symptoms and poor prognosis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and she has required pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Acute oliguric renal injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, which is likely due to poor forward flow and hypotension.
4. Elevated CK and Troponins: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, which are likely due to mild ischemia from increased demand and decreased ventricular filling volumes.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is unclear in etiology but may be related to the fracture and injury.
6. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia, which is likely due to hemoconcentration at presentation and has stabilized.
7. CAD: The patient has a reported history of CAD, but minimal details are available.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's critical AS and labile blood pressure make her at risk for cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute oliguric renal injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Ischemic cardiac damage: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and decreased ventricular filling volumes may lead to ischemic cardiac damage.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of fever or chills suggest a possible infection, which could worsen her condition.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and hemoconcentration at presentation make her at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's bibasilar crackles and hypotension make her at risk for respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's labile blood pressure and tachycardia make her at risk for cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
   function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic without
   sufficient forward flow and is in multiple organ failure . She is being
   considered for aortic valvuloplasty
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2, cavitary
   obliteration, and has symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.
   Unclear what patient wants but she and her son seem to be interested in
   a baloon valvuloplasty. This decisions is further supported by her PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high risk however the alternative is certainly
   grim.  Her Cardiac enzymes continue to rise indicating increasing
   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - Pursue valvuloplasty today
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Judicious Fluid repletion
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing.
   -Trend Cr, K+; PM [**Last Name (un) 12624**]
   - Kayexalate and CaGluconate PRN
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - valvuloplasty may be only hope of improving flow
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - checking liver enzymes
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Critical aortic stenosis (AS) with severe symptoms, which can lead to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death.
	* Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, which can worsen right ventricular failure.
	* Moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can increase the risk of right ventricular failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute oliguric renal injury due to prerenal azotemia, which can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
	* Rising creatinine and potassium levels, which can exacerbate the patient's condition.
3. Hepatic Complications:
	* Acute liver failure, which can be caused by hypoperfusion, sepsis, or other factors.
	* Rising INR and liver enzymes, which can indicate liver injury or failure.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium and confusion, which can be caused by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or other factors.

   Imaging: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
   function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic without
   sufficient forward flow and is in multiple organ failure . She was
   being considered for aortic valvuloplasty but decompensated briskly. On
   [**2-2**] in the AM she was somnolent and confused. She was made CMO.
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2, cavitary
   obliteration, and has symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.
   Unclear what patient wants but she and her son seem to be interested in
   a baloon valvuloplasty. This decisions is further supported by her PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high risk however the alternative is certainly
   grim.  Her Cardiac enzymes continue to rise indicating increasing
   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis.  Attempts
   to optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control were
   insufficient. She was unable to tolerate laying flat (unable to protect
   airway).
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control until Son arrives
   - [**Name2 (NI) 2076**] control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control as above
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing. Her renal failure is likely
   terminal.
   - Comfort Care
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - likely progressive
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
   function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic without
   sufficient forward flow and is in multiple organ failure . She was
   being considered for aortic valvuloplasty but decompensated briskly. On
   [**2-2**] in the AM she was somnolent and confused. She was made CMO.
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2, cavitary
   obliteration, and has symptoms leading to poor prognosis from AS.
   Unclear what patient wants but she and her son seem to be interested in
   a baloon valvuloplasty. This decisions is further supported by her PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high risk however the alternative is certainly
   grim.  Her Cardiac enzymes continue to rise indicating increasing
   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis.  Attempts
   to optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control were
   insufficient. She was unable to tolerate laying flat (unable to protect
   airway).
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control until Son arrives
   - [**Name2 (NI) 2076**] control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control as above
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing. Her renal failure is likely
   terminal.
   - Comfort Care
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - likely progressive
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history significant for CAD, critical aortic stenosis, and radiation proctitis, who presented after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension. The patient is extremely tachycardic, in multiple organ failure, and has worsening renal function, elevated cardiac enzymes, and acute liver failure.

The patient's current condition is critical, and the physician is considering a balloon valvuloplasty to improve cardiac function, but the patient and her son are unsure about the procedure. The patient's cardiac enzymes continue to rise, indicating increasing strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which is limiting cardiac output and leading to hypotension, tachycardia, and poor perfusion of vital organs.
2. Acute oliguric renal injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, which is likely due to poor forward flow and hypoperfusion. The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and her potassium levels are also increasing.
3. Acute liver failure: The patient has developed acute liver failure, which is likely due to hypoperfusion and poor perfusion of the liver.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is severely limiting cardiac output, and the physician is attempting to control it with metoprolol.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which is limiting perfusion of vital organs. The physician is attempting to optimize preload and afterload to improve cardiac output.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has developed leukocytosis, which is likely due to the fracture and injury. The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to a leukemoid reaction.
7. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which is likely due to hemoconcentration at presentation. There are no signs of active bleeding.

The patient's condition is critical, and the physician is considering comfort care measures, including morphine for pain control and optimization of medical therapy. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is to the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic and not
   adequately perfusing her organs. She is being considered for aortic
   valvuloplasty
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has symptoms
   leading to poor prognosis from AS. Unclear what patient wants but she
   and her son seem to be interested in a baloon valvuloplasty. This
   decisions is further supported by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high
   risk however the alternative is certainly grim.
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control
   - Pursue valvuloplasty today
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Judicious Fluid repletion
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   1) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.

   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp

   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS

   .
   .
   5) Elevated CE
s: Patient with elevated CK
s, Troponins, mildly
   elevated MBI in the context of increased demand. Patient without CP,
   SOB and elevation in enzymes likely due to mild ischemia from elevated
   HR and lower ventricular filling volumes.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat EKG this AM to ensure now changes
   - Restart Metoprolol as bp

   .
   6) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,
   critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a
   humeral fracture and hypotension. She is extremely tachycardic and not
   adequately perfusing her organs. She is being considered for aortic
   valvuloplasty
   # Critical AS/LVH: Patient with valve area of 0.7cm^2 and has symptoms
   leading to poor prognosis from AS. Unclear what patient wants but she
   and her son seem to be interested in a baloon valvuloplasty. This
   decisions is further supported by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] procedure is very high
   risk however the alternative is certainly grim.
   - Optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control
   - Pursue valvuloplasty today
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control
   - Pain control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   - Judicious Fluid repletion
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 10 cc/hr. No
   recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins and no symptoms of UTI with
   benign UA.
   -Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Control pain to decrease HR and improve forward flow
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   1) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.  Greatest difficulty will be managing pain in the
   context of patient's labile blood pressures and sensitivity to
   decreased preload as patient appears to have significant narcotic
   tolerance despite diminutive body habitus.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   - Echo today
   - Avoid nitro or medications to reduce preload given likely highly
   preload dependent for critical AS
   .
   .
   .
   .
   5) Elevated CE
s: Patient with elevated CK
s, Troponins, mildly
   elevated MBI in the context of increased demand. Patient without CP,
   SOB and elevation in enzymes likely due to mild ischemia from elevated
   HR and lower ventricular filling volumes.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat EKG this AM to ensure now changes
   - Restart Metoprolol as bp
s tolerate
   .
   6) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   -F/U cultures
   -No empiric abx unless spikes fever or culture positive
   -C diff test (though diarrhea sounds unchanged from baseline)
   .
   7) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   -Guaiac stool
   -Trend Cr
   .
   8) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).
   -Continue BB as tolerates

   strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis.  Attempts
   to optimize preload as tolerates with BB & pain control were
   insufficient. She was unable to tolerate laying flat (unable to protect
   airway).
   - if no valvuloplasty, expect liver/kidney/respiratory failure and
   start morphine drip as needed
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient
s blood pressures were initially low in the ED,
   improved transiently with 5L NS & pressors c/b worsening tachycardia.
   Systolic pressures have ranged from 60's to 90's:  Patient
   asymptomatic, extremities warm, and low blood pressure are all obtained
   from the right arm while leg pressures have been in the sbp
s 100
   Patient's pressures are insufficient to perfuse kidneys (anuric) and
   liver (rising INR). Relative hypotension may be due to adrenergic
   response leading to elevated HR
s, decreased ventricular filling time,
   leading to lower stroke volumes. Given critical AS, it is challenging
   to hydrate patient and optimize preload without overloading patient,
   particularly as patient has worsening bibasilar crackles.
   - IV Metoprolol 2.5 q2 hrs for rate control until Son arrives
   - [**Name2 (NI) 2076**] control to decrease HR and improve LVEDV
   #) Tachycardia: Rate is severely limiting the CO. Patient in chronic AF
   and not anticoagulated (hx of GI bleed). CHADS score 2
   (Hypertension/Age).
   - rate control as above
   #) Acute oliguric renal injury: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from
   labs but appears to be around 0.6-0.7.  Likely prerenal in context of
   appearing dry & FeNa < 1%, but has not responded to over 5L NS in the
   past 24 hours likely due to poor forward flow.  UOP < 3 cc/hr. Cr
   climbing steadily, Potassium climbing. Her renal failure is likely
   terminal.
   - Comfort Care
   .
   #) Acute Liver Failure: Patient arrived with INR of 1.0 and within 24
   hours, it is 1.6. This is partially responsible but likely reflects
   significant liver injury due to hypoperfusion. This is a negative
   prognostic sign
   - likely progressive
   .
   #) Humeral Fracture s/p fall:  Etiology of fall unclear as it was
   unwitnessed and patient is poor historian, but given extent of AS,
   concern is high for cardiogenic syncope. Patient does not want
   valvuloplasty or surgery so unclear what clear treatments can offer if
   AS is the cause of her syncope, but will continue to optimize
   medically. Orthopedics plans to manage fracture conservatively with
   sling and analgesia.
   - Standing Tylenol 1000mg q6H
   - Lidocaine 5% TD q24H
   - PO Dilaudid 4-8mg q3H:PRN as sbp
s tolerate
   #) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology though rapid increase and lack of
   fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggest possibly leukemoid in
   the context of fracture and injury. Lactate 2.6 this AM, but likely due
   to poor end-organ perfusion [**2-22**] tachycardia and severe AS.
   #) Anemia: Normocytic, likely hemoconcentrated at presentation with
   decreasing Hct but has stabilized.  No signs of active bleeding.
   .
   #) CAD: Reported history of CAD but minimal details and no caths in our
   system.  Patient is not on ASA or statin (lipids normal).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD,

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis. She was admitted to the ICU after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension.

The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past 24 hours, with worsening renal function, uptrending CEnzymes, and rising troponin and CK levels. She has developed acute oliguric renal injury, acute liver failure, and is in multiple organ failure.

The patient's cardiac enzymes continue to rise, indicating increasing strain and likely subendocardial ischemia with myonecrosis. Her cardiac output is severely limited due to critical AS, and she is in chronic atrial fibrillation.

The patient's blood pressure is labile, ranging from 60s to 90s, and her cardiac output is insufficient to perfuse her kidneys and liver. She is anuric and has rising INR, indicating severe liver dysfunction.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with worsening bibasilar crackles and a need for oxygen supplementation.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with somnolence, confusion, and delirium. She is unable to tolerate flat-supine position and has decreased level of consciousness.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 2.2 and a potassium level of 5.8. Her liver function tests are also abnormal, with a PT of 17.9 and an INR of 1.6.

The patient's imaging studies show moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, critical aortic stenosis, and moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's plan of care includes optimization of preload with beta blockers and pain control, as well as consideration of balloon valvuloplasty. However, the patient's condition is critical, and the possibility of liver and kidney failure, as well as respiratory failure, is high.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac arrest due to critical AS and tachycardia.
2. Liver failure leading to coagulopathy and bleeding.
3. Renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Respiratory failure leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
5. Neurological decline due to hypoperfusion and multi-organ failure.
6. Infection due to poor immune function and prolonged hospitalization.
7. Bleeding due to coagulopathy and liver dysfunction.

In summary, this patient is in critical condition and requires immediate attention and management to prevent further deterioration."
