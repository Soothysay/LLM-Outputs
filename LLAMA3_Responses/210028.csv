   A/P: 57yoM metastatic RCC to lungs/brain, recently admitted for
   increased neck swelling with worsened neck LAD and neck mass, p/w
   stridor and respiratory failuire.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and
   recent imaging shows worsening of disease. CT-neck performed yesterday
   showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of
   compression.  Yesterday the patient p/w resp distress, inspiratory
   stridor and neck swelling likely due to extrinsic compression from
   bulky LAD and IJ clots. Patient continues to be intubated and sedated.
   Most recent ABG: pH 7.41 pCO2 44 pO2 147 HCO3 29. Afebrile with no
   evidence of pna.  ENT consulted and rec 10mg decadron x3 and monitor
   for cuff leakage.  Also, suggested evaluation by IP/Thoracics for
   possible tracheostomy to bypass compression.  However, family meeting
   today to discuss possible [**Month/Year (2) 617**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain. He was recently admitted for increasing neck swelling with worsened neck lymphadenopathy (LAD) and neck mass, accompanied by stridor and respiratory failure.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a recent ABG showing pH 7.41, pCO2 44, pO2 147, and HCO3 29. He is afebrile with no evidence of pneumonia.

The patient has a history of IJ/subclavian/brachiocephalic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on previous admission, despite being on lovenox therapy. He also has a risk of developing further thrombotic events.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a plan to evaluate the possibility of tracheostomy to bypass compression. However, a family meeting is scheduled today to discuss the patient's goals of care and possible [**Month/Year (2) 617**].

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 3.9-6.6 K/uL
* Hct: 29.6-29.7%
* Plt: 426-446 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8-1.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 27-29 mmol/L
* Glucose: 124-157 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/34.4/1.3, ALT/AST: 10-20 IU/L, Alk Phos/T Bili: 86/0.3 IU/L, Differential-Neuts: 89.2%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.6%, Mono: 6.0%, Eos: 0.2%, Lactic Acid: 2.4 mmol/L, LDH: 309 IU/L, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of IJ/subclavian/brachiocephalic DVT and is at risk of developing further thrombotic events, particularly with the use of lovenox therapy.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive after sedation, and there is a risk of further hypotension if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine at home dosage, and there is a risk of further hypothyroidism if not managed appropriately.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain. He was recently admitted for increasing neck swelling with worsened neck lymphadenopathy (LAD) and neck mass, which is causing respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a recent arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.41, pCO2 44, pO2 147, and HCO3 29. The patient's recent imaging shows progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of compression. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on lovenox therapy. The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the compression of his airway by the bulky neck lymphadenopathy and internal jugular (IJ) clots. This could lead to further deterioration in his respiratory status and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of DVT and current anticoagulation therapy with lovenox may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to his cancer and chemotherapy may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's brain metastases and history of cyberknife treatment may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive decline.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of CKD and GERD may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's history of DVT and current anticoagulation therapy with lovenox may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic RCC may continue to progress, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed to ensure optimal oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Continue anticoagulation therapy with lovenox to prevent further DVT and pulmonary embolism.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his anticonvulsant therapy as needed to prevent seizures.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and hypothyroidism with medication and close monitoring.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his antacid therapy as needed to prevent bleeding or perforation.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's brain metastases, including consideration of whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery.
7. Discuss the patient's goals of care with his family and consider a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order if he is not a candidate for further aggressive treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, overweight/obese
* Head, ears, nose, throat: Normocephalic, endotracheal tube
* Lymphatic: Cervical adenopathy
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, regular rhythm
* Peripheral vascular: Present radial and digital pulses
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Absent radial and digital pulses
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to noxious stimuli, sedated, normal tone

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 426 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 157 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 309 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue intubation and sedation
* Monitor for cuff leakage and consider tracheostomy
* Continue lovenox therapy for deep vein thrombosis
* Hold all blood pressure medications and restart when stable
* Continue levothyroxine at home dosage for hypothyroidism
* Continue PPI for GERD
* NPO, place OG tube, and IVF to maintain MAP > 65 and UO > 30 cc/hr
* Lovenox and PPI prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further compromise of his airway and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's DVT can worsen, leading to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can worsen, leading to decreased metabolism and potential complications.
* GERD: The patient's GERD can worsen, leading to aspiration and potential complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and potential complications.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune system can lead to infection, which can worsen his condition.

The patient's DNR status and the plan to discuss his care with his family indicate that his condition is terminal, and the focus is on providing comfort care rather than attempting to cure his disease."
