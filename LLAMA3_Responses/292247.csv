   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt, who was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He is currently receiving empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses, and a neurosurgical consult has been arranged to culture shunt fluid and send CSF for cell count and cultures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%. His respiratory support includes tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers.

The patient's physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness with rebound, and his labs show an elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of pain medications and infection. He is receiving prn morphine for pain and has been NPO pending improved mentation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal tenderness with rebound suggests the presence of an abscess, which requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and surgical drainage.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is at risk of infection, which requires close monitoring and potential removal of the shunt if necessary.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications and infection, which requires careful management to avoid further worsening of his condition.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to his underlying lung disease and altered mental status, which requires close monitoring and treatment with oxygen therapy.
5. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and history of seizures make it essential to monitor him closely for signs of seizure activity.
6. Worsening of lung cancer: The patient's metastatic non-small cell lung cancer may worsen despite treatment, which requires ongoing management and discussion of goals of care with the patient and his family."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, as well as other medications such as Morphine Sulfate and Pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, with an ABG result of ///31/. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 175 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 39 and AST of 21.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to complications such as coagulopathy and encephalopathy.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and the ABG result of ///31/ may indicate respiratory failure.
5. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to the presence of multiple antibiotics and the patient's critical illness.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to the presence of a nasogastric tube and the patient's respiratory status.
8. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose level of 96 mg/dL may indicate hyperglycemia, which could lead to complications such as ketoacidosis and non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. The patient should be assessed for signs of sepsis, bleeding, and liver dysfunction, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here in AM
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology in AM; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here in AM
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology in AM; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He has been admitted to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and rebound, with moaning and difficulty understanding his responses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating infection and inflammation. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. His liver function tests are also abnormal, with elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has peritonitic signs on exam, and cultures from the abscess drain are pending. Empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone are being administered at CSF-penetrating doses.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and other factors. He is being treated with prn morphine for pain and is NPO pending improved mentation.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of asthma, but his symptoms are more consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema. He is being treated with tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol, and prn nebulizers are being used as needed.
4. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago and is being monitored for response to treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection put him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and altered mental status increase his risk for respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver function tests suggest liver dysfunction, which can lead to jaundice, coagulopathy, and other complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function increases his risk for acute kidney injury, which can require dialysis.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his symptoms, infections, and organ function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 67-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain metastases, and a ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt for increased intracranial pressure. He was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and concern for abscess, which was confirmed through ultrasound-guided drainage. The patient has a history of waxing and waning multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been treated for meningitis. He has also had U/S-guided drainage of a fluid collection yesterday.

The patient's 24-hour events were uneventful, with no acute distress or changes in his vital signs. His physical examination revealed no acute distress, with normal vital signs, except for a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). He has a right-sided abdominal tenderness with some rebound, and his respiratory examination showed wheezes on expiration.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.2-11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 175-143 K/uL. His renal function was normal, with a creatinine level of 0.6-0.5 mg/dL. His liver function tests were mildly elevated, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 39 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 21 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Peritonitis: The patient has a history of peritoneal process, which may lead to peritonitis. The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may worsen, and he may develop fever, nausea, and vomiting.
2. V-P shunt infection: Although neurosurgery feels that the V-P shunt is not infected, there is still a risk of infection. The patient may develop fever, headache, and meningitis.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory examination showed wheezes on expiration, which may indicate respiratory compromise. He may develop pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may worsen, and he may develop gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of MS and brain metastases may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, headache, or worsening of MS symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of meningitis and may be at risk for other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is mildly low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, it is essential to monitor him closely for any signs of complications and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe emphysema, LUL spiculated lesion, and old RUL lesions. He was intubated and started on invasive ventilation. He developed delirium and was given morphine, which was later held due to increased HR and BP. He became agitated and was given Haldol, which helped calm him down. However, he then developed SOB and wheezing, and a CXR showed no change. He was given nebs and ABG showed 7.36/55/88 on neb. The patient's EKG showed ST with new Q waves and TWI in III, and he was intubated and sent for CTPA, which was negative for PE but showed severe emphysema and LUL spiculated lesion. He was given 60 IV Solumedrol and antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime for PSA coverage. He was also started on flagyl 500mg Q8H.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's development of delirium and SOB could be indicative of pneumonia. The CXR showed no change, but the patient's symptoms and ABG results suggest that pneumonia is a possible diagnosis.
2. Asthma Attack: The patient's known asthma history and the development of wheezing and SOB suggest that an asthma attack could be occurring.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CTPA was negative for PE, the patient's EKG showed ST with new Q waves and TWI in III, which could be indicative of a PE.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypertension could be indicative of sepsis.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's requirement for invasive ventilation and the development of respiratory acidosis suggest that respiratory failure is a possibility.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's EKG showed ST with new Q waves and TWI in III, which could be indicative of a cardiovascular complication such as a myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy.
7. Infection: The patient's development of fever and the presence of ascites, blood, and urine cultures suggest that an infection could be present.
8. Delirium: The patient's development of delirium could be indicative of a underlying medical condition or a side effect of medications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and ventilated, and received antibiotics, steroids, and sedatives. He developed wheezing and was diagnosed with asthma, and his chest x-ray showed severe emphysema and a new spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe. The patient's temperature was 100.4°F, and his blood cultures were positive.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and his wheezing and asthma diagnosis may require ongoing management with bronchodilators and other respiratory therapies.
3. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an intra-abdominal abscess, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
4. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt was infected, which can lead to meningitis and other serious complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and his delirium may be related to his underlying medical conditions, medications, or infection.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's positive troponin and elevated D-dimer suggest the possibility of a pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and death if not treated promptly.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin and ST changes on his EKG suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death if not treated promptly.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing management of his sepsis, respiratory failure, and other underlying medical conditions. He should be treated with antibiotics, steroids, and other medications as necessary to manage his infection and underlying conditions. The patient's VP shunt should be evaluated and treated promptly to prevent further complications. The patient's delirium should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach, including pain management, sedation, and other therapies as necessary. The patient's respiratory failure should be managed with ongoing respiratory therapy and other interventions as necessary. The patient's cardiac arrhythmias should be monitored and treated promptly to prevent cardiac arrest and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Will try Fentanyl patch now while on drip so that when drip is weaned
   off hopefully will have coverage with patch by then
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Will try Fentanyl patch now while on drip so that when drip is weaned
   off hopefully will have coverage with patch by then
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly overnight, with the development of delirium, hypoxemia, and wheezing. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and sedated for agitation. A CT chest scan revealed severe emphysema, a new LUL spiculated lesion, and scattered nodules.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's ascites fluid shows WBCs >250, and he is being treated with Ceftaz and Flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. However, the patient's gen surgeon does not feel that he has an acute abdomen or a reason to operate at this point.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient has empiric vancomycin and ceftaz for CNS penetration, and neurosurgical consult is pending. The patient's shunt has not shown purulent drainage on inspection, and cultures will only be taken if the shunt has purulent drainage.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's delirium is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. The patient is at risk of developing seizures, and levetiracetam is being continued at home.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient's wheezing could be due to asthma, COPD/emphysema, or aspiration. He is being treated with Solumedrol for likely COPD exacerbation.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago and will likely require ongoing goals-of-care discussion.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: NPO for now, with the possibility of a normal diet when extubated.
* Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored and controlled as necessary.
* Lines: The patient has two IV lines, one of which is a central line.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with a HOB at 30 degrees and chlorhexidine.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be extubated today after receiving respiratory syncytial virus (RSBT) treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets, was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening of respiratory status, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and altered mental status.

The patient was intubated and sedated after developing severe emphysema, LUL spiculated lesion, and wheezing, which was initially thought to be an asthma attack. The patient's EKG showed ST with new Q waves and TWI in III, and a CT chest scan revealed severe emphysema, small bilateral effusions, and adjacent atelectasis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* WBC: 10.2-11.1 K/uL
* Hct: 32.1-31.0%
* Plt: 175-143 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 32-34 mmHg
* Glucose: 100-112 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.4/31.9/1.2, ALT/AST: 25/17, Alk Phos/T Bili: 37/0.9, Differential-Neuts: 93.9%, Lymph: 3.9%, Mono: 1.9%, Eos: 0.1%, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.0 g/dL, LDH: 230 IU/L, Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.4 mg/dL, PO4: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Abdominal abscess with bacterial peritonitis
* CNS infection around shunt
* Altered mental status (likely delirium) due to combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself
* Hypoxemia/wheezing (likely COPD exacerbation)
* Non-small cell lung cancer with recent bevacizumab treatment

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing empiric antibiotic therapy for abdominal abscess and CNS infection
* Serial abdominal exams and neuro exams
* Review of brain imaging with neuroradiology
* Treatment of pain as needed, but avoiding too many psychoactive medications
* Attempt to wean off ventilator after steroids
* Ongoing goals-of-care discussion with neuro-onc and/or oncology
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 100.4°F (axillary)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm
* Blood pressure: 129/85 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of asthma, and his recent CT scan showed severe emphysema and a new spiculated lesion in the left upper lobe.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.2-11.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.3-11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 175-143 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.5 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 0.5-0.5 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
* Known brain mets
* VP shunt
* Intra-abdominal abscess (suspected)
* COPD/emphysema
* Asthma

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection
* Serial abdominal exams
* Review of imaging with radiology
* Neurosurgical consult for VP shunt infection
* Review of brain imaging with neuroradiology
* Serial neuro exams
* Treat pain as needed, but avoid too many psychoactive medications
* Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
* Continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to intra-abdominal abscess or VP shunt infection
* Respiratory failure due to COPD/emphysema or asthma exacerbation
* Cardiac arrest due to hypoxemia or other cardiac conditions
* Neurological complications due to brain mets or VP shunt infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to intra-abdominal abscess or VP shunt infection
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to immunosuppression
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypotension or other factors

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions closely to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and an intrabdominal abscess. He was agitated overnight and received morphine and haloperidol.

The patient was started on solumedrol for COPD and had a CTA with no evidence of pulmonary embolism. He was intubated and required invasive ventilation. Blood cultures were taken, and he was started on antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, metronidazole, and ceftazidime.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 113 beats per minute (87-132 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 129/81 mmHg (92-191/105-126 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (15-29 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.2-11.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 175-143 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 32-34 mmol/L
* Glucose: 100-112 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of progression of lung cancer since his admission.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxemia and respiratory failure: likely due to aspiration event after sedation yesterday with underlying COPD. Will stop medrol and continue nebs.
* Delirium: will try low-dose fentanyl patch for pain, as he is getting altered mental status.
* Lung cancer: CT with evidence of progression of lung cancer since admission.
* ICU care: nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and comments.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: due to underlying COPD and aspiration event
* Sepsis: due to intrabdominal abscess and potential bacterial infections
* Delirium: due to altered mental status and potential medication side effects
* Pneumonia: due to aspiration event and underlying COPD
* Pulmonary embolism: due to immobility and potential deep vein thrombosis
* Infection: due to intrabdominal abscess and potential bacterial infections
* Lung cancer progression: due to underlying disease and potential spread to other areas of the body."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and an intrabdominal abscess. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and was started on invasive ventilation. He had a CTA without evidence of pulmonary embolism and was started on solumedrol for COPD. He received morphine and haloperidol for agitation and was started on antibiotics for suspected sepsis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 129/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 10.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. He has a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen of 194 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and increased mortality if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may worsen if not managed with appropriate sedation and pain control, leading to increased risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications.
4. Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer has progressed since his last CT scan, which may worsen his respiratory function and overall prognosis.
5. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications: The patient's ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be at risk for infection or malfunction, which could lead to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological complications.
6. Intrabdominal abscess complications: The patient's intrabdominal abscess may not be fully drained, which could lead to ongoing sepsis and potential complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Medication-related complications: The patient's medications, including morphine and haloperidol, may have side effects or interactions that could worsen his condition or lead to complications such as respiratory depression or gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Provisional Findings Impression: JKPe MON [**2181-8-6**] 11:10 PM
   No findings to suggest intracranial infection or VP shunt infection.
   Interval
   progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally
   worrisome for metastatic disease; however, no enhancing lesions were
   identified. Further evaluation with MRI would be beneficial.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including altered mental status, hypoxemia, wheezing, and non-small cell lung cancer.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.2, a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 175. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 20 and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 16.

The patient's imaging studies show a global white matter edema on CT scan, which may be consistent with radiation therapy. The OSH PET CT scan shows metastases to the liver, adrenal glands, and L4, as well as an increase in size of lung lesions. The CT head scan shows no findings to suggest intracranial infection or VP shunt infection, but does show interval progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally, which is worrisome for metastatic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal exam shows peritonitic signs, and the ascites fluid has a white blood cell count >250. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics to cover CNS penetration, and the neurosurgical consult is considering pulling the VP shunt today.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. The patient is fully sedated for possible surgery today.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing may be due to asthma, COPD/emphysema, or aspiration. The patient is receiving solumedrol for likely COPD exacerbation, and is being weaned off the ventilator today.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient's cancer is progressing, and the management plan for his wife is unclear.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection.
2. Monitor the patient's abdominal exam and WBC count for signs of sepsis.
3. Consider serial abdominal exams if able, given sedation.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust pain medications as needed.
5. Wean the patient off the ventilator today if not going to surgery.
6. Continue solumedrol for likely COPD exacerbation.
7. Consult with the patient's oncologist to discuss management plan for his non-small cell lung cancer."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is admitted to the ICU with concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has a history of brain metastases, VP shunt, and recent treatment with bevacizumab. He is currently intubated and sedated due to altered mental status, likely caused by a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain. The patient has a diagnosis of asthma, but is likely to have COPD/emphysema given his smoking history and late age of diagnosis. He is also experiencing hypoxemia and wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal fluid has a high white blood cell count, indicating infection. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but if the infection worsens, it may lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is at risk of infection, which could lead to meningitis and brain abscess.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be caused by delirium, which can lead to confusion, agitation, and increased risk of falls and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's infection and altered mental status may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ failure and increase the risk of mortality.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ascites fluid may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and sedation may increase the risk of pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and multi-organ failure.
8. Catheter-related infections: The patient's central lines and peripheral lines may be at risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications early on. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 125/79 mmHg, and his heart rate is 96 beats per minute.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological examination is limited due to sedation, but he is responding to stimuli and has no signs of meningitis or increased intracranial pressure.
* Abdominal: The patient has an abdominal abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics, and is at risk for peritonitis.
* Metastatic disease: The patient has metastatic disease in the liver, adrenal glands, and L4 vertebrae, which is consistent with his known brain mets.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further interventions to manage his ventilation and oxygenation.
* Sepsis: The patient's abdominal abscess and potential peritonitis increase his risk of developing sepsis.
* Infection: The patient's VP shunt and abdominal abscess increase his risk of developing infections, which can be life-threatening.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological examination is limited due to sedation, and he may be at risk for neurological deterioration if his condition worsens.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's metastatic disease in the liver and adrenal glands increases his risk of bleeding complications.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status is critical, and he may require further interventions to manage his blood pressure and heart rate.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any changes or complications that may arise. The patient's care team should also continue to work closely with his wife to manage his symptoms and address any concerns she may have."

   Interval
   progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally
   worrisome for metastatic disease; however, no enhancing lesions were
   identified. Further evaluation with MRI would be beneficial.
   CT Chest:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Increase in size of the previously described spiculated lesion in
   the
   right upper lobe, now extending to the pleura.
   3. New lung nodules as described above.
   4. Atelectasis of the right lower lobe, associated with effusion; no
   pleural
   nodule.
   5. Bronchomalacia of the right main bronchus and intermedius bronchus,
   evoked by expiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
 on OR schedule
   - F/U final read
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain metastases, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has a history of asthma, but the diagnosis is likely COPD/emphysema. He is currently intubated and sedated due to altered mental status, hypoxemia, and wheezing. The patient has received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago, and his condition appears to be progressing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has peritonitic signs on exam, and cultures from the NGTD are pending. He is receiving empiric antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration, and neurosurgical consultation is pending.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. His mental status will be difficult to manage, and sedation will be necessary.
4. Hypoxemia and wheezing: The patient has severe emphysema and wheezing on exam, and is at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer progression: The patient's condition appears to be progressing, and his oncologist is aware of his status.
6. Potential for sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying condition and antibiotics.
7. Potential for respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and intubation.
8. Potential for cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is at risk for cardiovascular instability due to his underlying condition and medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and adjust sedation as necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status, and consider weaning him off the ventilator if possible.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status, and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's WBC count and blood cultures, and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon to discuss the patient's VP shunt and potential surgical options."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   - F/U final read
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support with a CMV/ASSIST mode. He has a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 125/79 mmHg, heart rate is 96 beats per minute, and rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to sedation.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and his urine output is 1,260 mL.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.2 K/uL, and his platelet count is 175 K/uL.
* Metabolic: The patient's glucose level is 100 mg/dL, and his lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Abdominal abscess: The patient has ascites fluid with WBCs >250, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
* CNS infection around shunt: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration, and neurosurgical consultation is planned.
* Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to pain medications, infection, or pain itself, and he is fully sedated for possible surgery.
* Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has severe emphysema and wheezing on exam, and he is intubated for acute respiratory failure.
* Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient is progressing, and his management is unclear.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his abdominal abscess and potential bacteremia.
* Meningitis: The patient is at risk for meningitis due to his CNS infection around shunt.
* Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to his intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is at risk for ARDS due to his hypoxemia and wheezing.
* Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications due to his hypertension and potential sepsis.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that he receive close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and intra-abdominal abscess.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 143 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mg/dL
* Glucose: 96 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest: Negative for pulmonary embolism, with increased size of lesions on the right and new lesions on the left.
* CT head: No evidence of brain abscess.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The main barrier to extubation is altered mental status and delirium. The plan is to try to shut off sedation and extubate after the patient undergoes an orotracheal intubation (OR).
* Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has a drain in place, and cultures are negative.
* V-P shunt: The patient may undergo an OR today.
* Delirium: The patient's prior history of brain radiation therapy and CT changes may be playing a role. The plan is to try to minimize sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
* Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient may develop signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, or experience a worsening of abdominal pain.
* V-P shunt: The patient may develop complications related to the shunt, such as bleeding or infection.
* Delirium: The patient's mental status can continue to deteriorate, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and difficulty communicating.
* Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to the intra-abdominal abscess or other sources, leading to organ dysfunction and potential mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer, currently in the ICU. He has undergone multiple surgeries, including a V-P shunt procedure. The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and altered mental status (AMS) with delirium. He has a drain in place for an intra-abdominal abscess, which has yielded negative cultures. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mild liver enzyme elevation. His imaging studies, including a CT chest, show negative findings for pulmonary embolism and increased size of lesions on the right with new lesions on the left.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's main barrier to extubation is altered mental status and delirium. If not managed properly, this may lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Intra-abdominal abscess: Although the drain has yielded negative cultures, there is still a risk of infection and abscess formation. Close monitoring and management of the drain are essential to prevent complications.
3. V-P shunt: The patient is scheduled for possible OR today, which carries risks of bleeding, infection, and shunt failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's prior history of brain radiation and CT changes may be contributing to his delirium. Minimizing sedation and addressing underlying causes is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and mild anemia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures such as the V-P shunt procedure.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a drain make him susceptible to infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is essential to detect early signs of infection.
7. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
8. Nutritional compromise: The patient's ICU stay and altered mental status may lead to nutritional compromise, which can exacerbate underlying medical conditions and prolong recovery time."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concern for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient underwent VP shunt removal last evening and a head CT scan showed a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage dependently within the left occipital lobe, otherwise no significant interval change.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. He is being treated with propofol for sedation and has a goal of extubation today.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has peritonitic signs on exam and is being treated with antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is being treated with empiric vancomycin and ceftaz for CNS penetration, and a neurosurgical consult has been requested.
3. Delirium: The patient is at risk for delirium due to his altered mental status, and his pain medications may be exacerbating this condition.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has severe emphysema and wheezing on exam, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has a progressing tumor and is receiving bevacizumab treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7-7.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5-10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129-121 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20-17 mg/dL
* Sodium: 142-139 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.0-3.9 mEq/L
* Glucose: 112-83 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* CXR: Small right pleural effusion, left lung clear, and right apical lung mass.
* Head CT: Trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage dependently within the left occipital lobe.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection
* Propofol for sedation
* Serial neuro exams
* Fentanyl patch for pain control
* Tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol for COPD/emphysema
* Attempt to wean off ventilator today
* Continue bevacizumab treatment for non-small cell lung cancer"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and VP shunt. The patient underwent VP shunt removal last evening, and a post-op head CT showed a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage dependent on the left occipital region.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 101 bpm, BP 139/91 mmHg, RR 26 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving propofol infusion at 10 mcg/kg/min.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,365 mL of fluids and has a total output of 1,941 mL, resulting in a balance of -576 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 480 mL, RR of 16, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 7.7 K/uL, Hct is 29.5%, Plt is 129 K/uL, Cr is 0.5 mg/dL, TCO2 is 34 mmHg, Glucose is 112 mg/dL, and other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has peritonitic signs on exam, and cultures from the NG tube have grown GPC in pairs and clusters. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient has a VP shunt infection, and empiric antibiotics are being administered to cover CNS penetration. The patient will require a neurosurgical consult and follow-up cultures of the VP shunt tip.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to pain medications, infection, or pain itself. The patient will require serial neuro exams and close monitoring.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma, but the current symptoms may be explained by COPD/emphysema or aspiration.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient is receiving bevacizumab and is progressing. The oncologist is aware of the patient's status and will keep the patient's wife updated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the abdominal abscess and potential CNS infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and may require continued mechanical ventilation.
* Neurological complications: The patient may experience neurological complications due to the CNS infection or altered mental status.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient may experience cardiovascular complications due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may experience gastrointestinal complications due to the abdominal abscess or potential bowel perforation.

The patient's current plan includes:

* Serial abdominal exams and monitoring of WBC count and blood pressure.
* Empiric antibiotics for the abdominal abscess and CNS infection.
* Neurosurgical consult and follow-up cultures of the VP shunt tip.
* Serial neuro exams and close monitoring of the patient's mental status.
* Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery.
* Continued treatment for COPD exacerbation and potential aspiration."

   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider haldol prn for agitation if pain controlled and still
   delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA

   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider haldol prn for agitation if pain controlled and still
   delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, underwent VP shunt removal and was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has a history of brain mets and VP shunt infection. The preliminary read of the post-op head CT shows a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital region, but no significant interval change. The patient's blood culture grew GPC in pairs and clusters, which may be due to contamination. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has a history of abdominal abscess and peritonitic signs on exam. Cultures from the NG tube have been sent, and the patient is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient has a history of VP shunt infection, and the preliminary read of the post-op head CT shows a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, and a neurosurgical consult has been ordered.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. The patient is receiving propofol for sedation, and serial neuro exams are being performed.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma and COPD/emphysema, and is intubated due to hypoxemia and wheezing. The patient is receiving bronchodilators and will be weaned off the ventilator today.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and has received bevacizumab in the past. The patient's disease is progressing, and the oncologist is aware of the patient's status.
6. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and the patient's altered mental status may be due to a seizure. The patient is receiving levetiracetam and will be monitored for seizures.
7. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be due to the combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. The patient is receiving propofol for sedation, and serial neuro exams are being performed.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including intra-abdominal abscess, CNS infection, altered mental status, hypoxemia/wheezing, non-small cell lung cancer, seizures, and delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's 24-hour events include:

* VP shunt removal in the OR with a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage noted in the left occipital region on post-op head CT
* One blood culture bottle grew GPC in pairs and clusters, which is possible contamination
* Change in sedation to propofol, with the patient seeming comfortable overnight but becoming restless in the morning
* Goal of extubation today

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F) and 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm (79-101 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/91 mmHg (103-151/102 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (13-26 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7, 5.3, 6.1, and 7.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.5, 28.5, 29.6, and 30.5%
* Platelet count: 129, 115, 122, and 121 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34, 34, 36, and 34 mmHg
* Glucose: 112, 146, 147, 129, 124, 140, and 83 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to the patient's inability to respond or move.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Increased intracranial pressure due to the trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage
* Bacterial sepsis or infection due to the GPC growth in blood culture
* Respiratory failure or distress due to the patient's tachypnea and hypoxemia
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's coagulopathy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Venous thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis due to the patient's immobility and risk factors

Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's safe and effective care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone shunt removal and is experiencing ongoing fevers. The patient is on CPAP and has a history of respiratory failure, delirium, and pain.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F) with a current temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 79-101 bpm
* Blood pressure: 139/91 mmHg with a normal range of 103/90-151/109 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a normal range of 13-26 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7-7.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.5-30.5%
* Platelet count: 129-121 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34-36 mmHg
* Glucose: 112-140 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal:

* A small residual amount of blood on head CT
* Right lower lobe effusion/infiltrate on chest X-ray

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD and delirium, with a plan to try and drop down positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
* Delirium, with the patient currently receiving propofol
* Pain, with the patient receiving fentanyl and IV dilaudid
* V-P shunt removal, with a plan for follow-up CXR
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and lines

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate PEEP or COPD exacerbation
* Delirium due to inadequate sedation or underlying medical conditions
* Pain due to inadequate pain management or underlying medical conditions
* Infection due to the presence of a central venous catheter or other invasive devices
* Bleeding due to the presence of a central venous catheter or other invasive devices
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension or hypertension
* Neurological complications due to inadequate oxygenation or underlying medical conditions"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who had a shunt removed yesterday and continues to experience fevers. The patient is currently on CPAP and is receiving various medications, including propofol, fentanyl, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/91 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's cardiac index is 2.5 L/min/m², and their systemic vascular resistance index is 1,500 dynes/s/cm⁵.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7 x 10⁹/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 121 x 10⁹/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 32 mg/dL

* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Head CT: Small residual amount of blood
* Chest X-ray: RLL effusion/infiltrate

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: COPD and delirium. Agitation is likely to be a barrier to extubation. Will try and drop down PSV.
* Delirium: On propofol currently.
* Pain: Fentanyl 12.5mcg/min. Low dose IV dilaudid for pain.
* V-P Shunt removed: Follow up cx.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management. Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and delirium make them at risk for respiratory failure, which could worsen if not managed properly.
* Sepsis: The patient's fevers and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
* Bleeding: The patient's laboratory results show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which could indicate a bleeding risk.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are low, which could lead to hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to arrhythmias and other cardiac complications if not managed properly.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely to ensure that any potential complications are identified and managed promptly and effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt, who was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was previously intubated due to respiratory distress, but was extubated and placed on a shovel mask. However, he experienced increased work of breathing and was reintubated. He received antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He also has a history of asthma and COPD/emphysema, which may be exacerbated by his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection: The patient's abdominal exam showed peritonitic signs, and cultures from his NGTD showed WBCs >250. He is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens, but the infection may not be fully treated.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient's VP shunt was pulled, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration. However, the infection may not be fully treated, and he may develop meningeal signs.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He may be delirious from the medications, which may make it difficult to balance pain management.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to his underlying lung disease, aspiration, or other factors. He may require ongoing respiratory support, and his condition may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan showed severe emphysema and wheezing on exam, which may indicate pneumonia. He may require antibiotics to treat this infection.
7. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration during sedation may have exacerbated his respiratory distress and led to his reintubation.
8. Pain management: The patient's pain may not be adequately managed, which may lead to further complications and worsen his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
2. Monitor the patient's CNS infection around shunt and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
3. Balance pain management to avoid delirium and respiratory distress.
4. Continue respiratory support and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
5. Consider sepsis protocol if the patient's hypotension persists.
6. Consider antibiotics for pneumonia if the patient's chest CT scan shows evidence of infection.
7. Monitor the patient's aspiration risk and take measures to prevent further aspiration.
8. Reassess the patient's pain management plan to ensure adequate pain control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: The patient is extubated and stable on a shovel mask, but has continued to experience increased work of breathing and tachycardia (110s). They have been given nebs and albuterol and atrovent nebs three times.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 162/98 mmHg, and their heart rate is 118 bpm with a sinus tachycardia.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to their sedation.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a Tmax of 37.1°C, Tcurrent of 35.8°C, and a fluid balance of 1,689 mL in over 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 32.1%, and a platelet count of 118 K/uL. Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's continued need for oxygen therapy and nebs suggests that they may be at risk for respiratory failure.
* Pneumonia: The patient's increased work of breathing and opacification on their chest X-ray may indicate the development of pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the development of sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's abnormal kidney function and fluid balance may indicate the development of acute kidney injury.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate the development of an electrolyte imbalance.
* Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate the development of hepatic dysfunction.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability.

The patient's plan of care includes continued ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required CPAP
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required CPAP
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia and wheezing, which is likely due to asthma, COPD/emphysema, or aspiration. He was intubated after becoming acutely short of breath and is currently on CPAP.

The patient's abdominal abscess is being treated with Ceftaz and Flagyl, and serial abdominal exams will be performed to monitor for any changes. The VP shunt was pulled last evening, and the patient will be followed up with serial exams and culture data. The patient is also being treated for CNS infection around the shunt with empiric vanco and ceftaz.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium, and propofol will be used for sedation instead of morphine. The patient's non-small cell lung cancer is progressing, and his wife is aware of the progression but wants to get him back to his pre-admission status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection can lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status can lead to delirium if not properly managed.
4. Pain management: The patient's pain can be difficult to manage, and the use of propofol instead of morphine may be necessary to avoid exacerbating delirium.
5. Infection: The patient's VP shunt infection and abdominal abscess can lead to further infections if not properly treated.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's CNS infection around the shunt can lead to neurological complications if not properly treated.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing can lead to cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection with antibiotics and serial abdominal exams.
3. Manage the patient's pain with propofol and other medications as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and adjust sedation as necessary.
5. Continue to treat the patient's CNS infection around the shunt with empiric vanco and ceftaz.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was intubated and on invasive ventilation, but was extubated and placed on a shovel mask with nebs. He required BiPAP to manage his respiratory distress.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has tachycardia and hypertension, but no signs of heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. He does not have evidence of seizures.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has an abdominal abscess, with peritonitic signs on exam. He has been treated with antibiotics and has negative cultures.
* Infectious: The patient has a CNS infection around his shunt, which has been empirically treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime. He has also been treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further interventions to manage his respiratory distress.
* Infection: The patient has multiple sites of infection, including the abdominal abscess, CNS infection around his shunt, and potential aspiration pneumonia. He may require continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs of sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was extubated yesterday but experienced tachycardia and shortness of breath, requiring reintubation. They are currently receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with improved oxygenation. The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated with antibiotics for an abdominal abscess, with cultures all negative. They are also being considered for surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, particularly if the patient's COPD is not well-managed.
2. Abdominal Abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess is still present, and there is a risk of continued sepsis and organ dysfunction if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Lung Cancer: The patient's diagnosis of lung cancer is a significant concern, particularly given their critical illness. There is a risk of further tumor progression and spread, which could impact their overall prognosis.
4. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), particularly given their prolonged mechanical ventilation and critical illness.
5. Sepsis: The patient's abdominal abscess and ongoing infection increase their risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and there is a risk of fluid overload if their diuretic therapy is not optimized.
7. Medication-Related Complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and diuretics, which could lead to medication-related complications such as electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal disturbances, and medication interactions.

Given the patient's critical illness and multiple medical complications, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further deterioration and optimize their chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was extubated yesterday but experienced tachycardia and shortness of breath. They were reintubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with improved oxygenation. The patient has a history of COPD, abdominal abscess, and lung cancer. They are receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and steroids to manage their conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/92 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still critical, and they may require continued mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support measures.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of abdominal abscess and lung cancer, and they are receiving antibiotics. However, the cultures are negative, which may indicate a high risk of antibiotic resistance or a non-bacterial infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's CXR shows an increasing RLL infiltrate vs effusion, which may indicate fluid overload. Monitoring of fluid balance and diuretic therapy may be necessary to prevent fluid overload.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD is being treated with steroids and diuretics. However, the patient's respiratory status is still critical, and they may require further treatment to manage their COPD.
5. Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer is being treated with antibiotics and steroids. However, the patient's respiratory status is still critical, and they may require further treatment to manage their lung cancer.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal abscess may be a source of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
7. Sepsis: The patient's critical illness and positive blood cultures may indicate a high risk of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] want to
   give more fluids.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/85 mmHg. He is tolerating non-invasive ventilation well and is receiving antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient has a history of asthma, although his symptoms are more consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. He is also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain medications, and anticonvulsants. His laboratory results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and normal platelet count.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD/emphysema and his current respiratory status make him prone to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly managed.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status can lead to delirium, which can be difficult to manage, especially given his pain medication regimen.
4. Pain management: The patient's pain needs to be carefully managed to avoid exacerbating his delirium and to ensure his comfort.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of brain mets and his current altered mental status make him prone to neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of COPD/emphysema and his current respiratory status make him prone to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving non-invasive ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/85 mmHg. His SpO2 is 95%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his blood pressure is within normal limits.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is altered, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He is at risk for delirium and will require careful management of pain and sedation.
* Abdominal: The patient has an abdominal abscess, and cultures from the NG tube drainage (NGTD) and ascites fluid are pending. He is receiving empiric antibiotics and will require further evaluation and treatment if the abscess does not improve.
* Central nervous system (CNS): The patient has a VP shunt infection, and empiric antibiotics are being administered. He will require further evaluation and treatment if the infection does not improve.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for respiratory failure if his condition worsens.
* Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a VP shunt and abdominal abscess.
* Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including pain medications, infection, and pain itself. He is at risk for delirium and will require careful management of pain and sedation.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
* Organ failure: The patient's liver and kidney function are within normal limits, but he is at risk for organ failure if his condition worsens.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Non-invasive ventilation to support his respiratory status
* Empiric antibiotics to treat his abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection
* Pain management to reduce his discomfort and risk of delirium
* Further evaluation and treatment of his abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection
* Close monitoring of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status to identify any potential complications early."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off.
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. Repeat today
   to pull off more fluid as lungs still a bit wet.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is being treated in the ICU for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was intubated due to altered mental status, which was likely caused by a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain. The patient is currently stable on a shovel mask, with no peritoneal signs on examination. Cultures from the NGTD and ascites fluid are pending, and the patient is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens. The VP shunt was pulled, and the patient will be followed up with serial exams and culture data.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess is not yet fully treated, and there is a risk of further complications, such as perforation or spread to other organs.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt infection is ongoing, and there is a risk of further complications, such as meningitis or brain abscess.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely caused by a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain, and there is a risk of further complications, such as falls or respiratory depression.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially with the use of BiPAP.
5. Sepsis: The patient's infection and antibiotic use increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and VP shunt infection increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain abscess.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure, especially with the use of BiPAP.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection, and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with pain medications and other interventions as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and adjust treatment as needed to prevent pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and adjust treatment as needed to prevent neurological complications.
5. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon and an oncologist to further discuss the patient's treatment options and management plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with delta MS, respiratory failure, and an abdominal abscess. They were previously on mechanical ventilation but were transitioned to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) overnight. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and they were able to come off NIV for a short period. The abdominal abscess has also improved, and the patient is receiving antibiotics and other medications to manage their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still precarious, and they may require re-intubation if their oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase.
2. Infection: The polymicrobial growth in the V-P shunt and the abdominal abscess pose a risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Lung Injury: The patient's COPD and recent respiratory failure may lead to lung injury, which could result in prolonged ventilation and increased risk of complications.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's abdominal abscess and recent antibiotics may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's MS and recent respiratory failure may lead to neurological complications, such as cognitive impairment, seizures, or even death.
6. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial infection and recent antibiotics may lead to sepsis, which could result in multi-organ failure and death.
7. Kidney Injury: The patient's recent antibiotics and other medications may increase the risk of kidney injury, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's V-P shunt and recent antibiotics may increase the risk of bloodstream infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting their treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off.
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. Repeat today
   to pull off more fluid as lungs still a bit wet.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was transferred from another hospital and is being evaluated by neurosurgical and surgical teams. The patient has a history of asthma, but his symptoms are more consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. He is on respiratory support with a shovel mask and is receiving antibiotics for suspected infections.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein, indicating an active infection. His liver function tests are slightly elevated, and his albumin level is low. His blood glucose level is elevated, and he is receiving insulin to control his blood sugar.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his respiratory status, but he is responding to verbal commands and has no signs of meningeal irritation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory status and the presence of bacteria in his sputum, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels suggest an active infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require more aggressive respiratory support to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to pain, infection, or medication, and there is a risk of developing delirium.
5. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an intra-abdominal abscess, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt infection could lead to meningitis and brain abscesses if not treated promptly and effectively.
7. Non-small cell lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer is progressing, and there is a risk of further decline in his condition if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected infections and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Maintain respiratory support and adjust as needed to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust pain medication as needed to prevent delirium.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal status and consider imaging studies to rule out an intra-abdominal abscess.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's VP shunt infection and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
6. Consider further treatment for the patient's non-small cell lung cancer, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;  Now resolving in
   steroid taper and only requiring NC for O2.
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask/NC
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off. (Will
   change to equivalent dosing of PO prednisone).
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off. (Will
   change to equivalent dosing of PO prednisone).
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.

   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He has a history of asthma, COPD/emphysema, and has received bevacizumab therapy. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, wheezing, and altered mental status, which has been managed with oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and steroid taper. He has also been treated for abdominal abscess and CNS infection around the VP shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly in the abdominal cavity and around the VP shunt, given the presence of ascites fluid with WBCs >250 and the presence of GPCs and GNRs on culture of the VP shunt tip.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is fragile, and he may experience respiratory failure if his oxygen therapy is interrupted or if he develops further respiratory complications.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, and he may experience delirium due to the combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself.
4. Pain Management: The patient's pain management is complex, and he may experience inadequate pain control or opioid-related adverse effects.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient may experience gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has a high risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or worsening of his multiple sclerosis symptoms, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient may experience cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
8. Renal Complications: The patient may experience renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
9. Hematological Complications: The patient may experience hematological complications, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
10. Metastatic Disease Progression: The patient's metastatic disease may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical history. The patient has undergone various interventions, including the placement of a PICC line, administration of antibiotics, and initiation of SSI (Superficial Sepsis Index) treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/79 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is on CPAP/PSV mode.

Lab results indicate:

* WBC count: 7.1-10.8 K/uL
* Hct: 27.6-32.1%
* Plt: 121-127
* Cr: 0.4-0.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 34-36 mmHg
* Glucose: 83-174 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Differential-Neuts, Lactic Acid, Albumin, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, PO4

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has developed SSI, which may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on respiratory support, which increases the risk of VAP, a common complication in critically ill patients.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
