   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy, question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with submassive
   pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, holding coumadin for possible cardiac cath
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - will discuss possibility of cardiac cath for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   given positive stress test
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - Cont Vanco and Augmentin for 3 more days, last day [**1-26**].
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin and
   metoprolol.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - restart coumadin after any procedures, may need to aim for higher
   goal INR as outpatient given development of emboli with slightly
   subtherapeutic INR.
   - BB on hold for hypotension, IVF for tachycardia prn.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, BB given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and cardiomyopathy. She was admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism, new-onset cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 91/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 31.6%
* White blood cell count: 15.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 134 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 84 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with heparin for pulmonary embolism, and her anticoagulation therapy has been adjusted accordingly. She has also been started on antibiotics for possible pneumonia and continued on antihypertensive medications.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. She is at risk for developing end-organ damage and hemodynamic instability.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has new-onset cardiomyopathy, which may be related to ischemic or non-ischemic etiologies. She has been diagnosed with fixed defects on echocardiogram, which suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea for approximately two weeks and has been started on flagyl for a 10-day course. She is at risk for developing bowel ischemia and may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, which is consistent with renal failure. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is also elevated.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, with a hematocrit level of 34.8%. She has been treated with blood transfusions in the past and may require further transfusions.
6. Depression: The patient has been diagnosed with depression and is being treated with celexa.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. End-organ damage from pulmonary embolism
2. Hemodynamic instability from cardiomyopathy
3. Bowel ischemia from diarrhea
4. Worsening renal failure
5. Further anemia exacerbation
6. Depression worsening

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent further complications and ensure optimal treatment outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, holding coumadin for possible cardiac cath
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - will discuss possibility of cardiac cath for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   given positive stress test
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - Cont Vanco and Augmentin for 3 more days, last day [**1-26**].
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin and
   metoprolol.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - restart coumadin after any procedures, may need to aim for higher
   goal INR as outpatient given development of emboli with slightly
   subtherapeutic INR.
   - BB on hold for hypotension, IVF for tachycardia prn.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, BB given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic, and a submassive pulmonary embolism. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic anemia. She was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has a history of prior pulmonary embolism. She is currently on heparin, and her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm and blood pressure of 91/44 mmHg. She has improved appetite and no further diarrhea on loperamide.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which may lead to further complications such as right ventricular failure, hypotension, and even death.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient has cardiomyopathy and a submassive pulmonary embolism, which may lead to cardiac failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure or worsening of existing renal disease.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea for two weeks and continues to have episodes daily, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and bowel ischemia.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to her cardiac condition, pulmonary embolism, or medication side effects.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may worsen with continued bleeding or hemolysis.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking celexa, which may require adjustments to her medication regimen.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly her blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pulmonary embolism with heparin and consider lysis if she develops end-organ damage or hemodynamic instability.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider cardiac catheterization to evaluate her coronary arteries.
4. Continue to manage the patient's diarrhea with loperamide and consider stool studies to rule out other causes of diarrhea.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medication regimen as needed to prevent worsening of renal failure.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to manage her depression and anxiety.
7. Continue to educate the patient and her family about her condition, treatment options, and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism, new cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pneumonia. She was found to have atrial fibrillation with a heart rate above 100 beats per minute and was treated with metoprolol. Her breathing has improved, and she has increased appetite. She has been started on heparin and coumadin, and her medication regimen has been adjusted to manage her hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further deterioration in her condition if not managed promptly.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has new-onset cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has persistent diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and bowel ischemia.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her creatinine levels are elevated, which can lead to further decline in her renal function.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, which can lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of complications.
7. Infectious Complications: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infectious complications, such as sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Bleeding Complications: The patient is taking anticoagulant therapy, which can increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as hematuria, hematemesis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary embolism and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as needed.
2. Manage the patient's cardiomyopathy with medications and monitor her cardiac function closely.
3. Continue to treat the patient's diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents and monitor her electrolyte levels closely.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her antihypertensive therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infectious risk and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH
   and per family likely missed some coumadin doses . Consider lysis
   should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal, 2.5-3, will need
   lifelong coumadin, restarted last evening.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s negative for renal mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - d/c
d abx, given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have
   caused worsening diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR as above unchanged
   - f/u pulm as outpatient
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now at baseline. Currently improved
   from prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Firm mass left breast that patient reports is unchanged and has been
   attributed to prior implant.
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Recurrent pulmonary embolus in setting of subtherapeutic
   anticoagulation. Continue heparin and titrate coumadin to INR [**1-26**].
    Underlying etiology not known.
   2. Abnormal CXR and CT with question interstitial lung disease.
   Pulmonary following.
   3. Cardiomyopathy. No known CAD. No overt heart failure. Will plan
   repeat echo.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 20 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Firm mass left breast that patient reports is unchanged and has been
   attributed to prior implant.
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Recurrent pulmonary embolus in setting of subtherapeutic
   anticoagulation. Continue heparin and titrate coumadin to INR [**1-26**].
    Underlying etiology not known.
   2. Abnormal CXR and CT with question interstitial lung disease.
   Pulmonary following.
   3. Cardiomyopathy. No known CAD. No overt heart failure. Will plan
   repeat echo.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 20 minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE) admitted to the ICU for submassive PE, cardiomyopathy, and pneumonia. She has been experiencing diarrhea for approximately 2 weeks, which has been treated with flagyl, and has been started on coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient has a history of chronic anemia and is being treated for depression.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (74-89 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/34 mmHg (51-118/71 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (14-18 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished, no acute distress
* Normal lung sounds, with crackles 3/4 up right lung and to the apex on the left, worse than yesterday
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Extremities: 1+ edema in both legs
* Warm skin
* Attentive, grossly non-focal neurologic examination

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 134 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mEq/L
* Sodium: 106 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Calcium: 26 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL

* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 231 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pulmonary embolism recurrence or progression
* Cardiomyopathy exacerbation or progression
* Chronic interstitial lung disease
* Renal failure or worsening of existing renal dysfunction
* Diarrhea and bowel ischemia
* Anemia worsening
* Depression worsening
* Hypertension or hypotension
* Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism
* Infection or sepsis

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Heparin infusion for anticoagulation
* Coumadin for anticoagulation

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism, likely related to her recent cardiomyopathy and history of prior pulmonary embolism. She has been started on Coumadin, and her INR will be monitored. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anemia, and is currently experiencing diarrhea and renal failure. She has also been diagnosed with chronic interstitial lung disease and has a history of pneumonia. The patient's cardiomyopathy is likely ischemic in nature, and she has been prescribed ASA and Zocor. Her antihypertensives have been held due to concerns about hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk for further pulmonary embolism, particularly if she develops end-organ damage or hemodynamic instability.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy is likely ischemic in nature, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely related to her cardiomyopathy and hypertension, and she is at risk for further deterioration in her renal function.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely related to her cardiomyopathy and is at risk for further complications, such as bowel ischemia or sepsis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's antihypertensives have been held due to concerns about hypotension, and she is at risk for further hypotension if her blood pressure becomes too low.
6. Hypercoagulability: The patient has a history of prior pulmonary embolism and is at risk for further thrombotic complications, particularly if her INR becomes too high.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, particularly if her immunocompromised state is not managed properly.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs will be assessed and managed to ensure that she is receiving adequate calories and nutrients.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and managed to ensure that she is within a normal range.
3. Lines: The patient will have multiple lines placed for medication administration and blood draws.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP to prevent further complications.
5. Communication: The patient's family will be kept informed of her progress and any changes in her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH
   and per family likely missed some coumadin doses . Consider lysis
   should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal, 2.5-3, will need
   lifelong coumadin, restarted last evening.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s negative for renal mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - d/c
d abx, given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have
   caused worsening diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR as above unchanged
   - f/u pulm as outpatient
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now at baseline. Currently improved
   from prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE), likely due to a combination of factors including her history of prior PE, chronic illness, and recent discontinuation of Coumadin. She has a history of hypertension, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%. She also has chronic anemia, and has been experiencing diarrhea for approximately 2 weeks.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism Complications:** The patient is at risk for further embolization, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), right ventricular failure, and even death.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiomyopathy and heart failure could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
3. **Renal Complications:** The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating potential renal impairment. Further worsening of renal function could lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's diarrhea could worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially even bowel ischemia.
5. **Infectious Complications:** The patient has a history of pneumonia and chronic illness, making her susceptible to further infections, including sepsis and septic shock.
6. **Hemorrhagic Complications:** The patient's anemia and potential bleeding disorders could lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
7. **Thrombotic Complications:** The patient's history of prior PE and chronic illness could lead to further thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.
8. **Psychiatric Complications:** The patient's history of depression and recent medication changes could lead to worsening of her mental health, including suicidal ideation and behavior.

**Assessment and Plan:**

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of worsening pulmonary embolism, cardiac complications, renal impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding, or infectious complications. The patient should be continued on anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin, and her medications should be adjusted as necessary to manage her hypertension, heart failure, and anemia. Close communication with the patient and her family is crucial to ensure that her needs are being met and that any changes in her condition are addressed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU with a submassive PE and has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in origin.

The patient is currently receiving heparin and Coumadin, and is being monitored for potential complications. She is also receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, and has been started on a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 134 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, and her heart rhythm is sinusoidal. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm and without edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. However, there is a risk of recurrent PE or progression to a more severe form of the condition.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy is likely ischemic in origin, and there is a risk of further cardiac damage or deterioration in cardiac function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea and is currently experiencing episodes of diarrhea. There is a risk of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and bowel ischemia.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the respiratory tract, given her recent hospitalization and the presence of a central line.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive anticoagulation therapy, and her cardiomyopathy should be closely monitored. She should also be closely monitored for signs of renal failure, and her diarrhea should be managed with anti-diarrheal medications and fluid replacement. Additionally, her risk of infection should be assessed, and she should receive prophylactic antibiotics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism. They were started on Coumadin 2.5mg PO daily due to family and patient preference not to use Lovenox. The patient's CXR appears unchanged, and a renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or masses. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, Demerol, and confusion/delirium. They have been receiving Heparin Sodium infusions and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. They are receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and have an ABG of //25/. The patient's physical examination is limited due to non-assessment of various areas.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.0, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 160 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated troponin-T, ALT, and AST levels.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea. The ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's pulmonary embolism and the use of Heparin Sodium.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to the patient's cardiomyopathy.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's pulmonary embolism and potential respiratory support.
4. Infection, such as sepsis, due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and potential for central line-associated bloodstream infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, due to the patient's diarrhea.
6. Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's elevated troponin-T and ALT levels.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR today
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR today
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU with submassive PE, cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea. The patient's medical history includes prior PE, and she was temporarily subtherapeutic on coumadin at the previous hospital.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 36.8°C, T-current 36.7°C, HR 78 bpm, BP 103/34 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and IV fluid boluses are being administered as needed.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,519 mL of IV fluids, with a balance of 974 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 98%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 15.0 x 10^9/L, Hct 31.6%, Plt 134 x 10^9/L
	+ Blood chemistry: Na 134 mmol/L, K 4.1 mmol/L, Cl 106 mmol/L, Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, Glucose 84 mg/dL
	+ Coagulation studies: PT 17.9 seconds, PTT 90.4 seconds, INR 1.6
	+ Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
	+ Other labs: Albumin 2.4 g/dL, LDH 231 IU/L, Ca++ 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.0 mg/dL, PO4 3.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. However, there is a risk of recurrent PE, especially if the patient develops end-organ damage or hemodynamic instability.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has cardiomyopathy, which can lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for several weeks and has been treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of bowel ischemia, especially if the patient develops bloody diarrhea or has a low cardiac output state.
4. Renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which can worsen if the patient develops acute kidney injury or if the patient's cardiac output decreases.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can worsen if the patient develops acute kidney injury or if the patient's cardiac output decreases.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which can worsen if the patient develops bleeding or if the patient's cardiac output decreases.
7. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, which can worsen if the patient develops a low cardiac output state or if the patient's electrolyte imbalance worsens.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and consider higher INR goals for lifelong coumadin therapy.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and administer IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Continue oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and monitor the patient's SpO2 levels.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac output and electrolyte levels to prevent cardiac failure and arrhythmias.
5. Continue to treat the patient's diarrhea with anti-diarrheal agents and consider bowel ischemia if the patient develops bloody diarrhea or has a low cardiac output state.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as needed to prevent acute kidney injury.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust transfusion therapy as needed to prevent bleeding.
8. Continue to treat the patient's depression with anti-depressant medications and consider adjusting the medication regimen as needed to prevent worsening of depression.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, diarrhea, renal failure, hypertension, anemia, and depression. A comprehensive plan of care is necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal medical management."
