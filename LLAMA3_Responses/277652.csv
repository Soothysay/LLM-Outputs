   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of hypertension and IVDU presents with
   tachycardia and hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication
   noncompliance.
   1. Hypertension
   Etiology of her hypertension appears most likely secondary to
   medication noncompliance, particularly given the risks of rebound
   hypertension with clonidine use. Additional possibilities include
   benzodiazepine withdrawal as pt reports that she was recently taken off
   of alprazolam and was given diazepam within the last week. Her blood
   pressure has significantly improved since transfer to the floor.
   - restart home meds
   - increase HCTZ to 25mg daily
   - consider adding third [**Doctor Last Name **] such as a CCB tomorrow if BP is still
   elevated
   - titrate off nitro gtt
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   2. Tachycardia
   Differential diagnosis for patient's tachycardia includes dehydration
   or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Regarding benzodiazepine withdrawal,
   patient was previously taking xanax and then her primary care stopped
   providing her xanax. She then went to the ED on [**2114-2-27**] where she was
   prescribed both percocet and valium. If she has taken valium over the
   last week, she has likely tapered off benzodiazepines herself with a
   long acting benzodiazepine. Given that her tachycardia worsened while
   being in the ED, this appears most consistent with a withdrawal
   syndrome.
   - send serum and urine tox screens
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue IVF
   3. IVDU
   Patient reports a relapse in heroin use in the last week.
   - Addictions consult once hemodynamically stable
   4. Oral Ulcer
   Unclear etiology for oral ulcer. Differential includes infectious or
   pre-malignant/malignant lesion.
   - swab lesion
   - consider ENT referral in the AM for further evaluation.
   5. Asthma
   Patient appears stable and appears well-controlled on current regimen.
   - continue advair, albuterol prn, and singulair prn
   6. Nausea and vomiting
   Symptoms appear to have resolved now. Etiology is unclear. Differential
   includes gastroenteritis, withdrawal. Abdominal exam benign.
   - antiemetics prn
   - continue to follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and medication noncompliance, presenting with tachycardia and hypertensive urgency. She has been weaned off the nitroglycerin drip and started on clonidine and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Her blood pressure has improved since transfer to the floor. The patient has a white lesion on the hard palate with erythematous surroundings, and her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebound hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to the sudden discontinuation of clonidine, which can lead to rebound hypertension.
2. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be related to benzodiazepine withdrawal, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's oral ulcer may be an infectious lesion, which can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to gastroenteritis or withdrawal, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's asthma may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, if not managed properly.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypertension and tachycardia are likely related to medication noncompliance and benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient's oral ulcer is unclear in etiology, and the patient's asthma appears stable. The patient's nausea and vomiting have resolved.

The plan is to restart the patient's home medications, increase the dose of HCTZ, and consider adding a third medication such as a calcium channel blocker if the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. The patient will be monitored on telemetry and will continue to receive IV fluids. The patient will also be sent for serum and urine toxicology screens. An addictions consult will be arranged once the patient is hemodynamically stable."

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and medication noncompliance. She presents with tachycardia and hypertensive urgency, which has improved since transfer to the floor but has now decreased to the 90s. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with medication holds and fluid boluses. The patient's tachycardia is attributed to dehydration or benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient has a history of IVDU and reports a relapse in heroin use in the last week. She also has an oral ulcer of unclear etiology, which may be infectious, pre-malignant, or malignant. The patient's asthma appears stable, and she is being managed with her current regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently too low, and there is a risk of rebound hypertension if clonidine is not managed properly.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen if benzodiazepine withdrawal is not managed, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. IVDU: The patient's relapse in heroin use increases the risk of overdose, infection, and other complications.
4. Oral Ulcer: The patient's oral ulcer may be infectious, pre-malignant, or malignant, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Dehydration: The patient's fluid status is being monitored, and there is a risk of dehydration if fluid boluses are not effective.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to gastroenteritis or withdrawal, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's asthma is stable, but there is a risk of exacerbation if her regimen is not managed properly.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of hypertension and IVDU presents with
   tachycardia and hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication
   noncompliance.
   1. Hypertension
   Etiology of her hypertension appears most likely secondary to
   medication noncompliance, particularly given the risks of rebound
   hypertension with clonidine use. Additional possibilities include
   benzodiazepine withdrawal as pt reports that she was recently taken off
   of alprazolam and was given diazepam within the last week. Her blood
   pressure has significantly improved since transfer to the floor, but
   has gotten too low, now in the 90s
   - hold clonidine for now
   - increase HCTZ to 25mg daily, already given in the AM, also hold for
   now
   - patient titrated off nitro gtt
   - f/u urine tox screens, serum tox screen negative
   - Give fluid boluses to augment blood pressure.
   - consider Yohimbine to counteract clonidine if BP does not improve
   with fluid boluses.
   2. Tachycardia
   Differential diagnosis for patient's tachycardia includes dehydration
   or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Regarding benzodiazepine withdrawal,
   patient was previously taking xanax and then her primary care stopped
   providing her xanax. She then went to the ED on [**2114-2-27**] where she was
   prescribed both percocet and valium. If she has taken valium over the
   last week, she has likely tapered off benzodiazepines herself with a
   long acting benzodiazepine. Given that her tachycardia worsened while
   being in the ED, this appears related to withdrawal syndrome.
   - serum tox negative and urine tox pending
   - monitor on telemetry
   - fluid boluses as above
   3. IVDU
   Patient reports a relapse in heroin use in the last week.
   - Addictions consult once hemodynamically stable
   4. Oral Ulcer
   Unclear etiology for oral ulcer. Differential includes infectious or
   pre-malignant/malignant lesion.  Patient has had tumor on tongue in the
   past with positive margins on biopsy, she has not followed this up.
   - swab lesion
   - call ENT, as they have seen her before.
   5. Asthma
   Patient appears stable and appears well-controlled on current regimen.
   - continue advair, albuterol prn, and singulair prn
   6. Nausea and vomiting
   Symptoms appear to have resolved now. Etiology is unclear. Differential
   includes gastroenteritis, withdrawal. Abdominal exam benign.
   - antiemetics prn
   - continue to follow
   - advance diet PRN

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of hypertension, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and medication noncompliance. She presents with hypertension, tachycardia, and oral ulcer. Her hypertension is likely secondary to medication noncompliance, particularly clonidine use. Her tachycardia is attributed to benzodiazepine withdrawal, dehydration, or a combination of both. The patient has a history of IVDU and reports a relapse in heroin use. She also has a history of oral ulcers and a tumor on her tongue. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her blood pressure has fluctuated between 90s and 175/109 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still fluctuating, and there is a risk of a hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
2. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient is at risk of severe benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if not managed with appropriate medication.
3. Dehydration: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be exacerbated by dehydration, which needs to be monitored and managed.
4. Infection: The patient's oral ulcer may be a sign of an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and managed promptly.
5. Malignancy: The patient's history of a tumor on her tongue and the presence of an oral ulcer may indicate a risk of malignant transformation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of asthma and the use of sedatives may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of IVDU and benzodiazepine withdrawal may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medication as necessary to prevent hypertensive crisis.
2. Manage the patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms with appropriate medication and monitoring.
3. Investigate the patient's oral ulcer and provide appropriate treatment if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hydration status and provide fluids as necessary to prevent dehydration.
5. Consider adding Yohimbine to counteract clonidine if the patient's blood pressure does not improve with fluid boluses.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status and provide supportive care as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a pain management specialist to manage her chronic pain.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care as necessary."

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.  I would add/emphasize
   that her blood pressure has come under better control and her
   hypotension has resolved.  This morning she has a moderate headache but
   detailed neurologic exam (motor, sensory, cerebellar, cranial nerves)
   is without focality.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o woman with hypertensive urgency (improved).
   Hypertensive Urgency
   Will need ongoing titration of her medications.  I am concerned that
   her
home medications
 may represent increased doses and numbers o
   fmedications without her always taking them.  She will need a roughly
   stable regimen prior to discharge, given reported trouble following up
   in past.  TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely.
   Nausea/Vomiting
   No resolved
   Oral lesion
   ENT believes this is an aphthous ulcer.  Recommends outpatient
   follow-up.
   History of tongue tumor
   ENT recommends outpatient follow-up.
   Headache
   Exam is very reassuring, in detail.  If headache does not improve, or
   if it occurs with recrudescence of headache, would consider
   intracranial imaging.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.  I would add/emphasize
   that her blood pressure has come under better control and her
   hypotension has resolved.  This morning she has a moderate headache but
   detailed neurologic exam (motor, sensory, cerebellar, cranial nerves)
   is without focality.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o woman with hypertensive urgency (improved).
   Hypertensive Urgency
   Will need ongoing titration of her medications.  I am concerned that
   her
home medications
 may represent increased doses and numbers o
   fmedications without her always taking them.  She will need a roughly
   stable regimen prior to discharge, given reported trouble following up
   in past.  TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely.
   Nausea/Vomiting
   No resolved
   Oral lesion
   ENT believes this is an aphthous ulcer.  Recommends outpatient
   follow-up.
   History of tongue tumor
   ENT recommends outpatient follow-up.
   Headache
   Exam is very reassuring, in detail.  If headache does not improve, or
   if it occurs with recrudescence of headache, would consider
   intracranial imaging.
   Other issues as detailed in ICU team note.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be provided:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypertension, likely due to essential hypertension. She had a transient episode of hypotension after taking her home medications, but this has since resolved. The patient is currently being treated with HCTZ and metoprolol, and her blood pressure is under better control.

The patient also has an oral lesion, which is likely an aphthous ulcer, and will require outpatient follow-up with an ENT specialist. She has a history of tongue tumors, and the ENT specialist recommends outpatient follow-up for this as well.

The patient is experiencing a moderate headache, but a detailed neurologic exam is without focal findings. Her nausea and vomiting have resolved.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 172/110 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to end-organ damage, such as kidney disease, heart failure, and stroke.
2. Recurrence of hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Infection of the oral lesion, which can lead to sepsis and systemic illness.
4. Recurrence of nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, which can lead to thyrotoxic crisis and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Uncontrolled hypercortisolism, which can lead to Cushing's syndrome and its associated complications.
7. Infection of the tongue tumors, which can lead to sepsis and systemic illness.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing titration of her medications, outpatient follow-up with an ENT specialist, and close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypertension. She has a history of non-compliance with her medications, which may have contributed to her current condition. She is being treated with HCTZ and metoprolol for her hypertension. She also has an aphthous ulcer in her mouth, which is being evaluated by an ENT specialist. She has a history of diarrhea, cough, and headache, which have resolved. She is currently receiving fluids and has a normal hemodynamic profile. She is also being monitored for hyperthyroidism and hypo/hypercortisolism, but the results are unremarkable.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and kidney damage.
2. Aphthous ulcer complications: The ulcer may become infected or spread to other areas of the mouth, leading to complications such as sepsis or difficulty eating and drinking.
3. Headache and myalgias: The patient's headache and myalgias may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and any imbalance may lead to complications such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, or respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of diarrhea and cough may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen if not properly treated.
6. Hyperthyroidism or hypo/hypercortisolism: The patient's lab results are unremarkable, but it is still important to monitor her for any signs of hyperthyroidism or hypo/hypercortisolism, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, tremors, or weakness.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure her safe transition to the floor."
