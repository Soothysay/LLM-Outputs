   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient underwent an EGD, however she began becoming agitated and
   desated so she had to be intubated so that the EGD could be finished.
   On EGD a firm area of ulceration which was thought to be a mass was
   visualized.  Given her elevated INR, no biopsy was taken.  There did
   not appear to be active bleeding.
   - She was left intubated overnight with plans to extubate her in the
   am.
   - Hct after admission decreased from 29.3 to 25 so she was transfused 1
   unit of PRBC.  Repeat INR was 1.2.

   INPATIENT
   EGD ([**2-11**]): Protruding Lesions: An ulcerated circumferential mass with
   stigmata of recent bleeding and of malignant appearance was found at
   the proximal second part of the duodenum just past the apex of the
   duodenal bulb. The mass was able to be traversed by the scope, but the
   lumen appeared to be narrowed by the lesion. 4 injections of [**1-27**] cc of
   Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier **] were applied for hemostasis with success.
   Impression: Blood in the duodenum
   Diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum
   Mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum (injection)
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
   Assessment and Plan

   the duodenum with dilated CBD

   Plan:
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt for suspected upper source, no octreotide as
   low probability of varices
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - active type and will keep 4 units active crossmatch tonight,
   transfuse to ~30
   - f/u GI, per ED, they plan to scope tonight
   .
   # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA. depending on findings on EGD, ERCP vs EUS
   vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this indeed arises
   from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.

   # atrial fibrillation:
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presented with upper GI bleeding and a mass in the duodenum with dilated CBD. She underwent an EGD, which revealed a firm area of ulceration thought to be a mass, but no biopsy was taken due to her elevated INR. She was intubated overnight and plans were made to extubate her in the morning. She was transfused 1 unit of PRBC due to a decrease in Hct from 29.3 to 25. She is currently receiving pantoprazole, propofol, and midazolam, and has a Code Full status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding has not been fully controlled, and she may continue to experience bleeding complications, including anemia, hypovolemic shock, and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and intubation increase her risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Malignancy: The patient's mass in the duodenum with dilated CBD may be a sign of underlying malignancy, which could lead to further complications, including metastasis and organ failure.
4. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's history of painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools is concerning for cholangiocarcinoma, which could lead to further complications, including liver failure and death.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications, including stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which could lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and inability to eat may lead to malnutrition, which could further complicate her condition and increase her risk of infections and other complications.

   EGD ([**2-11**]): Protruding Lesions: An ulcerated circumferential mass with
   stigmata of recent bleeding and of malignant appearance was found at
   the proximal second part of the duodenum just past the apex of the
   duodenal bulb. The mass was able to be traversed by the scope, but the
   lumen appeared to be narrowed by the lesion. 4 injections of [**1-27**] cc of
   Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier **] were applied for hemostasis with success.
   Impression: Blood in the duodenum
   Diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum

   the duodenum with dilated CBD
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - Continue pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt, no octreotide as no varices seen
   on EGD

   Consider placing a PICC.
   - active type and has 3 units active crossmatch currently, transfuse to

   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 87-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with upper GI bleeding and a mass at the duodenum. She underwent an EGD, which showed a firm area of ulceration thought to be a mass, but no biopsy was taken due to her elevated INR. The patient was intubated during the procedure and was left intubated overnight. Her Hct decreased from 29.3 to 25, and she received 1 unit of PRBC transfusion. She was also transfused 2 units of FFP to correct her INR.

The patient is currently awake and gestures that she wants the ETT removed. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin, which was stopped due to active bleeding. Her INR has been less than 2, and she is at risk for bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 40%. Her respiratory support includes a Vt of 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and elevated INR. Her platelet count is 166 K/uL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal limits. Her calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination shows a thin, elderly female with an ETT in place. Her eyes and conjunctiva are pale, and she has mild scleral icterus. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and her respiratory examination shows a few coarse upper airway sounds bilaterally.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's INR is still elevated, and she is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently adequate, but she may require more aggressive respiratory support if her condition deteriorates.
3. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she has a history of upper GI bleeding, which increases her risk for sepsis.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain and jaundice, are concerning for pancreatitis.
5. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's symptoms, including painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools, are concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to embolic events or worsening of her cardiac function.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her overall condition.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition and adjusting her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and the potential complications that can arise, and they should be involved in the decision-making process regarding her care."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient underwent an EGD, however she began becoming agitated and
   desated so she had to be intubated so that the EGD could be finished.
   On EGD a firm area of ulceration which was thought to be a mass was
   visualized.  Given her elevated INR, no biopsy was taken.  There did
   not appear to be active bleeding.
   - She was left intubated overnight with plans to extubate her in the
   am.
   - Hct after admission decreased from 29.3 to 25 so she was transfused 1
   unit of PRBC.  Repeat INR was 1.2.
   This am the patient is awake and gestures that she wants the ETT

   URINE CULTURE-PENDING
   INPATIENT
   EGD ([**2-11**]): Protruding Lesions: An ulcerated circumferential mass with
   stigmata of recent bleeding and of malignant appearance was found at
   the proximal second part of the duodenum just past the apex of the
   duodenal bulb. The mass was able to be traversed by the scope, but the
   lumen appeared to be narrowed by the lesion. 4 injections of [**1-27**] cc of
   Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier **] were applied for hemostasis with success.
   Impression: Blood in the duodenum
   Diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum
   Mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum (injection)
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD
   # Respiratory support: Patient intubated for the EGD secondary and
   continued on the ventilator overnight to allow sedation time to wear
   off.  This am she is alert and indicating that she wants the tube
   removed.
   - Will extubate her this am.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - Change pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - Patient only has 1 18-guage PIV and she has very difficult access.
   Consider placing a PICC.
   - active type and has 3 units active crossmatch currently, transfuse to
   ~30
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease.
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.1.
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, an 87-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with upper GI bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. She underwent an EGD, which showed a firm area of ulceration thought to be a mass. Due to her elevated INR, no biopsy was taken. The patient was intubated overnight and is now awake and indicating that she wants the tube removed.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on coumadin at home. She had an INR >2 at admission and received 2 units of FFP. Her current INR is 1.2. She also has hypertension and is on diltiazem.

The patient has a number of lab results, including:

* WBC: 17.6
* Hct: 25.5
* Plt: 166
* Cr: 0.8
* Glucose: 182
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.2/23.8/1.2, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Upper GI bleeding
* Mass in the duodenum
* Atrial fibrillation
* Hypertension
* Jaundice
* Chalk-colored stools
* Painless jaundice

The patient is currently intubated and is being treated with pantoprazole and propofol. She is also receiving transfusions of PRBC and has had 3 units of blood transfused since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding from the mass in the duodenum
* Infection from the intubation or EGD
* Pancreatitis or cholangitis from the mass in the duodenum
* Respiratory failure from the intubation or underlying lung disease
* Cardiac complications from the atrial fibrillation or hypertension
* Kidney injury from the bleeding or underlying kidney disease
* Hepatic injury from the bleeding or underlying liver disease
* Nutritional deficiencies from the NPO status

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Extubation once she is alert and stable
* Further workup for the mass in the duodenum, including ERCP, EUS, or MRCP
* Discussion with the patient and family about the findings on EGD and their wishes for diagnosis and treatment
* CXR to evaluate for metastatic disease
* Restart of diltiazem and consideration of a PICC line
* Continued monitoring of the patient's labs and vital signs."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated
   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   stent placement. Patient said she is leaning towards stent placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the
   surgery would not be able to entirely remove the mass nor is she a good
   candidate given her age and that chemo is systemically toxic though
   could explore options if she and family are interested.
   - called daughter and relayed above information - she plans on coming
   in on Monday to discuss
   - social work consult placed
   - likely plan for CT Monday (not yet ordered) to further evaluate lung
   nodules
   - need to call ERCP Monday to set up for this week (more urgently if
   spikes)
   - hct stable 32--->30--->25.1, got 1u pRBC overnight, repeat hct this

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD
   # Respiratory support: Patient intubated for the EGD secondary and
   continued on the ventilator overnight to allow sedation time to wear
   off.  This am she is alert and indicating that she wants the tube
   removed.
   - Will extubate her this am.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
   hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - Change pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - Patient only has 1 18-guage PIV and she has very difficult access.
   Consider placing a PICC.
   - active type and has 3 units active crossmatch currently, transfuse to
   ~30
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.1.
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding
   - Restart diltiazem.
   # HTN: Will restart dilt as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Condition:**

The patient, a 87-year-old female, is currently in the ICU after being intubated for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and having a mass at the duodenum with dilated common bile duct (CBD). She is being treated for hypotension and anemia due to the GI bleed. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin, which has been held due to active bleeding.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **GI Bleed:** The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. **Pancreatic or Biliary Cancer:** The mass at the duodenum with dilated CBD is suspicious for pancreatic or biliary cancer, which could lead to further complications such as metastasis, liver failure, and death.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and death.
4. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension could lead to organ failure, including renal failure, if not adequately managed.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia could lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. **Infection:** The patient's compromised immune system due to her age and underlying medical conditions makes her susceptible to infections, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization could lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, which could exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
8. **Chest Nodules:** The patient's chest X-ray showed a possible nodule, which could represent metastatic disease, and further evaluation with a chest CT is needed to determine the extent of her disease.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleed and hypotension with fluids and blood products as needed.
2. Consider placing a PICC line to facilitate access for further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
3. Discuss the findings of the EGD with the patient and her family to determine the best course of action for diagnosis and treatment.
4. Consider further imaging studies, such as ERCP, EUS, or MRCP, to determine the origin of the mass and potential for malignancy.
5. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with blood transfusions as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide enteral nutrition if necessary.
8. Consider further evaluation of the patient's chest nodules with a chest CT to determine the extent of her disease."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source:  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   Melena followed by hematemesis is c/w upper GI
   bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan
   demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection, density suspicious for
   blood, involving the duodenum with compression of the CBD with
   intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying malignancy may have
   eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally and out of the
   lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - discussed findings with patient and daughter
 patient expressed that
   she is leaning towards palliative stenting, daughter to come in today
   to discuss with team
   - coninute pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - check pm hct goal  >27
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   # Respiratory support: Extubated successful yyesterday morning. Patient
   was intubated for the EGD secondary and continued on the ventilator
   overnight to allow sedation time to wear off.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.1.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source:  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   Melena followed by hematemesis is c/w upper GI
   bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan
   demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection, density suspicious for
   blood, involving the duodenum with compression of the CBD with
   intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying malignancy may have
   eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally and out of the
   lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - discussed findings with patient and daughter
 patient expressed that
   she is leaning towards palliative stenting, daughter to come in today
   to discuss with team
   - coninute pantoprazole 40mg IV gtt to po bid
   - check pm hct goal  >27
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Will keep the patient NPO for now.
   - Hct is stable this am at 30.3. (Had gotten 3 units total since
   arriving at [**Location (un) 78**]).  Will check q8h Hct.
   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   # Respiratory support: Extubated successful yyesterday morning. Patient
   was intubated for the EGD secondary and continued on the ventilator
   overnight to allow sedation time to wear off.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - check CEA and CA [**96**]-9.
   - Will discuss the findings of the EGD once the patient is extubated
   and alert with her and her family to decide on how aggressive they want
   to be with diagnosis.
   - CXR showed a possible nodule, will likely need to have a chest CT for
   workup for metastatic disease
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.1.
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and a large mass in the duodenum. The patient was extubated successfully, and the EGD showed a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient is leaning towards palliative stenting, and the daughter is expected to come in today to discuss the findings with the team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient has ongoing bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient was intubated for the EGD, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially if the patient is not extubated properly.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially if the patient's anticoagulation therapy is not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient has a mass in the duodenum, which could be infected, and there is a risk of sepsis.
5. Pancreatic cancer: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a high likelihood of pancreatic cancer, which could lead to complications such as jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain.
6. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies also suggest a possibility of cholangiocarcinoma, which could lead to complications such as jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain.
7. Metastatic disease: The patient's lung nodules and possible nodule on the CXR suggest a possibility of metastatic disease, which could lead to complications such as respiratory failure, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient has a large mass in the duodenum, which could lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not managed properly.
9. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking anticoagulation therapy, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
10. Psychosocial complications: The patient has a poor prognosis, and there is a risk of psychosocial complications such as depression, anxiety, and distress.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage the potential complications to ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 87-year-old female, was extubated successfully and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. She has a history of upper GI bleeding, with melena and hematemesis on admission, and was found to have a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum on EGD. The mass is concerning for malignancy.

The patient has been receiving treatment for her bleeding, including pantoprazole and pRBC transfusions. Her Hct has stabilized at 29.8%, and she has received a total of 4 units of pRBC.

The patient's family has been informed of her diagnosis and treatment options, and they are leaning towards palliative stenting. The patient's daughter will be coming in to discuss the plan with the team.

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is on coumadin and has an INR of 1.1. She is also on diltiazem, which was held due to asymptomatic hypotension and bradycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Plt, as well as abnormal LFTs. Her CEA level is elevated at 18, and her CA-9 level is pending.

The patient's chest CT scan showed lung nodules suspicious for metastatic disease. A chest CT is planned for further evaluation.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor after family discussion regarding her plan.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleeding may continue, and further bleeding episodes may occur.
2. Infection: The patient's EGD procedure may have introduced bacteria into her bloodstream, increasing the risk of infection.
3. Malignancy: The patient's mass in the duodenum may be malignant, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the disease.
4. Metastatic disease: The patient's lung nodules may be metastatic, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the disease.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her lung nodules or other underlying conditions.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further complications, such as perforation or obstruction."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated
   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   [** 80**] placement. Patient said she is leaning towards [** 80**] placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the
   surgery would not be able to entirely remove the mass nor is she a good
   candidate given her age and that chemo is systemically toxic though
   could explore options if she and family are interested.
   - called daughter and relayed above information - she plans on coming
   in on Monday to discuss
   - social work consult placed
   - likely plan for CT Monday (not yet ordered) to further evaluate lung
   nodules
   - need to call ERCP Monday to set up for this week (more urgently if
   spikes)
   - hct stable 32--->30--->25.1, got 1u pRBC overnight, repeat hct this

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3505**] has extubated safely and is aware of current medical issues.
   She had a sense that a malignant diagnosis might be the problem given
   early satiety and weight loss. She denies abdominal pain or dyspnea.
   She is agreeable to palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement if that will temporize
   her symptoms. She wishes to discuss this with her family too. She
   needed one unit of pRBC
s for hct of 25.1
   Exam notable for mild icterusTm 97 BP 116/54 HR 70 RR of 16 with sats
   of 96% on 2lpm . she has marked kyphosis and end inspiratory crackles
   at bothbases. Labs notable for WBC 11.9K, HCT of 29.8, K+ of 3.2 .
   Agree with plan to update family and then request ERCP consultation for
   palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement. She will likely need intubation for this
   given difficulty with EGD. A chest CT scan will be performed to assess
   RUL nodules today. She will remain on IV PPI today and in the ICU till
   procedures completed. She remains a DNR by prior stated wishes.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - successfully extubated
   - patient told about mass and very high likelihood that it is cancer,
   also told about the lung nodules and that those may be metastases.
   Explained possibility of biopsy vs. palliative pancreatic/duodenal
   [** 80**] placement. Patient said she is leaning towards [** 80**] placement as
   she's 'had a good life' and would prefer to focus on comfort.  She
   asked about possibility of surgery or chemo - explained that the
   surgery would not be able to entirely remove the mass nor is she a good
   candidate given her age and that chemo is systemically toxic though
   could explore options if she and family are interested.
   - called daughter and relayed above information - she plans on coming
   in on Monday to discuss
   - social work consult placed
   - likely plan for CT Monday (not yet ordered) to further evaluate lung
   nodules
   - need to call ERCP Monday to set up for this week (more urgently if
   spikes)
   - hct stable 32--->30--->25.1, got 1u pRBC overnight, repeat hct this
   morning 29.8

   Protruding Lesions
   An ulcerated circumferential mass with stigmata of recent bleeding and
   of malignant appearance was found at the proximal second part of the
   duodenum just past the apex of the duodenal bulb. The mass was able to
   be traversed by the scope, but the lumen appeared to be narrowed by the
   lesion. 4 injections of [**1-27**] cc of Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier **] were applied for
   hemostasis with success.
   Excavated Lesions
   A single diverticulum with small opening was found in the second part
   of the duodenum. There was no active bleeding from the diverticulum.

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.

   - Will have discussion with the patient and the family about the
   findings on EGD and their wishes of how aggressive they want to be
   regarding diagnosis and treatment options before making further plans
   for diagnosis.
   - if plan is to [**Last Name (LF) 80**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] contact ERCP
   # Respiratory support: Extubated successful yyesterday morning. Patient
   was intubated for the EGD secondary and continued on the ventilator
   overnight to allow sedation time to wear off.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.
   - CEA elevated at 18 (normal 0-4)

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3505**] has extubated safely and is aware of current medical issues.
   She had a sense that a malignant diagnosis might be the problem given
   early satiety and weight loss. She denies abdominal pain or dyspnea.
   She is agreeable to palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement if that will temporize
   her symptoms. She wishes to discuss this with her family too. She
   needed one unit of pRBC
s for hct of 25.1
   Exam notable for mild icterusTm 97 BP 116/54 HR 70 RR of 16 with sats
   of 96% on 2lpm . she has marked kyphosis and end inspiratory crackles
   at bothbases. Labs notable for WBC 11.9K, HCT of 29.8, K+ of 3.2 .
   Agree with plan to update family and then request ERCP consultation for
   palliative [**Known lastname 80**] placement. She will likely need intubation for this
   given difficulty with EGD. A chest CT scan will be performed to assess
   RUL nodules today. She will remain on IV PPI today and in the ICU till
   procedures completed. She remains a DNR by prior stated wishes.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient has undergone one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight and has a stable hemoglobin level of 29.8%. She is currently extubated and receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient has been informed about the mass and the possibility of biopsy versus palliative pancreatic/duodenal stenting. She is leaning towards palliative stenting and has asked to discuss the plan with her family.

The patient has also been diagnosed with lung nodules, which may be metastases. A chest CT scan is planned to assess these nodules.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alkaline phosphatase (ALK-PHOS), and bilirubin. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and she has an elevated risk of bleeding.

The patient is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy, but this has been held due to active bleeding. She is also receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has already experienced bleeding from the mass in the duodenum, and further bleeding may occur if the mass is not treated.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if her respiratory function deteriorates.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and malabsorption may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamin B12 and iron.
6. Metastatic disease: The patient's lung nodules may be metastases from the primary tumor in the duodenum, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the disease.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Perform a chest CT scan to assess the lung nodules and determine the extent of the disease.
3. Consult with the patient and her family to discuss the plan for diagnosis and treatment.
4. Consider palliative pancreatic/duodenal stenting to temporize the patient's symptoms.
5. Continue to provide supportive care, including anticoagulation therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiac status closely and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Consider further evaluation, such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), to determine the origin of the mass and the extent of the disease."

   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD last night which showed a
   mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of chronic aspiration/infection, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to upper GI bleeding and a mass at the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on EGD. She has received 4 units of packed red blood cells and has a stable Hct of 29.8. The patient is leaning towards palliative stenting and has a family meeting scheduled to discuss the findings on EGD and treatment options.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to the mass at the duodenum and the presence of a large mass vs fluid collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD, intrahepatic duct dilatation.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration/infection and has a bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis on CT scan, which may be related to ongoing infectious or inflammatory process.
3. Malignancy: The patient has a mass concerning for malignancy on EGD and has an elevated CEA level, which may indicate the presence of metastatic disease.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to her age, underlying chronic conditions, and the presence of a mass vs fluid collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD, intrahepatic duct dilatation.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and has received anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and may be at risk of developing renal failure due to her underlying chronic conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
7. Hepatic Failure: The patient has an elevated bilirubin level and may be at risk of developing hepatic failure due to her underlying chronic conditions and the presence of a mass vs fluid collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD, intrahepatic duct dilatation.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her for any signs of complications and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 31.8 this
   morning.  She has received a total of 4 units of pRBC during her
   admission (last transfused the night of [**2-12**]).  Source is mass
   surrounding dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by
   hematemesis which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for
   lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid
   collection, density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with
   compression of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an
   underlying malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both
   intraluminally and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed
   a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - The findings were discussed with the patient and her family
 the
   patient expressed that she wants palliative stenting which is now
   planned for sometime in the next few days.
   - coninute pantoprazole 40 mg po bid
   - As her Hct has been stable over the past day, can check daily Hct.
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.  The prelim read on the chest CT did not show metastases.
   CEA elevated at 18 (normal 0-4).  The ERCP fellow evaluated her and
   felt she would not benefit from duodenal stenting as she wasn
   obstructed there, but that she would benefit from biliary stenting.
   - f/u CA [**96**]-9 level
   - as above palliative stenting via ERCP is planned for sometime in the
   next few days.
   - f/u final chest CT read
   - trend LFT
   # Positive UCx: The patient
s UCx returned with 10,000- 100,000 gram
   neg rods, however her UA showed only 0-2 WBC and had no leuks or
   nitrites.  Given the lack of evidence of infection on the UA, will not
   treat.
   - Resend UA/UCx.
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na decreased from 138 to 132 today.  She
   does not appear volume overloaded, so this is most likely SIADH vs
   slight volume overload.
   -  Will advance her diet, hold IVF and let her regulate her intake.  If
   she remains hyponatremic can check urine lytes and consider fluid
   restriction if they are consistent with SIADH.
   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.0. Received one dose of dilt yesterday with
   asymptomatic hypotension and brady to 50
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding
   - Continue her outpatient diltiazem.
   # HTN: Continue her outpatient Diltiazem 60 mg qid.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who was admitted with upper GI bleeding and a mass in the duodenum. She has undergone an EGD, which showed a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum concerning for malignancy. Her hemoglobin has been stable, and she has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during her admission. She has also had a CT scan, which demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection surrounding the duodenum with compression of the CBD and intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The patient has expressed a desire for palliative stenting, which is planned for the next few days.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has had a significant amount of bleeding, which may continue to be a concern.
2. Malignancy: The mass in the duodenum is concerning for malignancy, which may have eroded into a vessel, causing bleeding.
3. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's history of painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools is concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
4. Pancreatic cancer: The patient's symptoms are also concerning for pancreatic cancer.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have decreased, which may be due to SIADH or slight volume overload.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to be a concern, particularly if it is not well-controlled.
7. Hypotension: The patient's recent asymptomatic hypotension and brady may be a concern, particularly if it is not well-controlled.
8. DVT: The patient's recent bleed may have increased her risk of DVT.
9. VAP: The patient's recent bleed may have increased her risk of VAP.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's recent bleeding and hospitalization may have caused malnutrition, which may need to be addressed.

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - The findings were discussed with the patient and her family
 the
   patient expressed that she wants palliative stenting which is now
   planned for [**2-15**]

   - check pm hct goal  >27
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Hct is stable this am at 29.8, will recheck this afternoon, has
   gotten a total of 4 units pRBC
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.  The prelim read on the chest CT did not show metastases.
   CEA elevated at 18 (normal 0-4).  The ERCP fellow evaluated her and
   felt she would not benefit from duodenal stenting as she wasn
   obstructed there, but that she would benefit from biliary stenting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 29.8 this
   morning after 1 unit pRBC overnight.  Source is mass surrounding
   dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by hematemesis
   which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for lavage at
   [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid collection,
   density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with compression
   of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an underlying
   malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both intraluminally
   and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed a mass in the
   proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning for
   malignancy.
   - The findings were discussed with the patient and her family
 the
   patient expressed that she wants palliative stenting which is now
   planned for [**2-15**]
   - coninute pantoprazole 40 mg po bid
   - check pm hct goal  >27
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
   - Hct is stable this am at 29.8, will recheck this afternoon, has
   gotten a total of 4 units pRBC
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.  The prelim read on the chest CT did not show metastases.
   CEA elevated at 18 (normal 0-4).  The ERCP fellow evaluated her and
   felt she would not benefit from duodenal stenting as she wasn
   obstructed there, but that she would benefit from biliary stenting.
   - f/u CA [**96**]-9 level
   - as above palliative stenting via ERCP is planned for [**2-15**]
   - f/u final chest CT read

   # Positive UCx: The patient
s UCx returned with 10,000- 100,000 gram
   neg rods, however her UA showed only 0-2 WBC and had no leuks or
   nitrites.  Given the lack of evidence of infection on the UA, will not
   treat.
   - Resend UA/UCx.
   #Aatrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.0. Received one dose of dilt yesterday with

* Alkaline phosphatase: 854 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 1.6 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's radiological imaging shows:

* Chest CT: bronchiectasis, scattered tree-in-bud opacities, and nodular opacity in the right upper and left upper lobes, which is compatible with ongoing infectious or inflammatory process.
* Abdominal CT: severe biliary dilatation, which is known.

The patient's current diagnosis includes:

* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
* Mass in the duodenum
* Cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer
* Atrial fibrillation
* Chronic aspiration/infection
* Bronchiectasis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Further bleeding from the duodenal mass
* Infection or sepsis due to the presence of gram-negative rods in the urine culture
* Pancreatitis or cholangitis due to the suspected cancer
* Atrial fibrillation with possible embolic complications
* Respiratory failure due to bronchiectasis and chronic aspiration/infection
* Renal failure due to dehydration or sepsis
* Hepatic failure due to cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer

The patient's plan of care includes:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and mass at
   the duodenum with dilated CBD and a mass concerning for malignancy on
   EGD.
   # Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Hct stable at 31.8 this
   morning.  She has received a total of 4 units of pRBC during her
   admission (last transfused the night of [**2-12**]).  Source is mass
   surrounding dudodnum seen on EGD.   On admission had melena followed by
   hematemesis which is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for
   lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid
   collection, density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with
   compression of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an
   underlying malignancy may have eroded into a vessel, bleeding both
   intraluminally and out of the lumen.  She underwent an EGD which showed
   a mass in the proximal second part of the duodenum which was concerning
   for malignancy.
   - The findings were discussed with the patient and her family
 the
   patient expressed that she wants palliative stenting which is now
   planned for sometime in the next few days.
   - coninute pantoprazole 40 mg po bid
   - As her Hct has been stable over the past day, can check daily Hct.
   - Appreciate GI and surgery consults, will f/u recs.
    # Mass vs Fluid Collection surrounding the duodenum with CBD,
   intra/extra hepatic duct dilatation: Likely cause of her elevated alk
   phos. The history of painless jaundice and chalk colored stools is esp
   concerning for cholangioCA.  Could also represent pancreatic cancer.
   ERCP vs EUS vs MRCP may be helpful in delineating origin, ie, if this
   indeed arises from the biliary tree or simply from neighboring
   structures.  The prelim read on the chest CT did not show metastases.
   CEA elevated at 18 (normal 0-4).  The ERCP fellow evaluated her and
   felt she would not benefit from duodenal stenting as she wasn
   obstructed there, but that she would benefit from biliary stenting.
   - f/u CA [**96**]-9 level
   - as above palliative stenting via ERCP is planned for sometime in the
   next few days.
   - f/u final chest CT read
   - trend LFT
   # Positive UCx: The patient
s UCx returned with 10,000- 100,000 gram
   neg rods, however her UA showed only 0-2 WBC and had no leuks or
   nitrites.  Given the lack of evidence of infection on the UA, will not
   treat.
   - Resend UA/UCx.
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na decreased from 138 to 132 today.  She
   does not appear volume overloaded, so this is most likely SIADH vs
   slight volume overload.
   -  Will advance her diet, hold IVF and let her regulate her intake.  If
   she remains hyponatremic can check urine lytes and consider fluid
   restriction if they are consistent with SIADH.
   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient is on coumadin at home and by report had
   an INR > assay at [**Location (un) 78**] and received 2 units of FFP.  Here her INR
   has been <2, this am was 1.0. Received one dose of dilt yesterday with
   asymptomatic hypotension and brady to 50
   - hold anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding
   - Continue her outpatient diltiazem.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with upper GI bleeding, mass in the duodenum, and dilated CBD. She has a history of chronic aspiration/infection, and the preliminary chest CT report shows bronchiectasis, scattered opacities, and pleural effusions. She has received 4 units of packed red blood cells and is currently on pantoprazole 40 mg PO bid. The patient's hemoglobin level has been stable over the past day, and she has been started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. She has also been diagnosed with hyponatremia and is being managed with fluid restriction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleeding is a significant concern, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's history of chronic aspiration/infection and the presence of bronchiectasis and scattered opacities on the chest CT increase her risk of developing pneumonia or other infections.
3. Malignancy: The mass in the duodenum and dilated CBD are concerning for cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to stroke or thromboembolic complications if left untreated.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could lead to seizures, coma, or even death if left untreated.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level could indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO bid to manage upper GI bleeding.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse as necessary to maintain a stable hemoglobin level.
3. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation therapy and monitor for signs of stroke or thromboembolic complications.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and manage hyponatremia with fluid restriction and electrolyte supplementation as necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation of the mass in the duodenum and dilated CBD with ERCP, EUS, or MRCP to determine the origin of the mass and the best course of treatment.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and manage liver dysfunction with supportive care and treatment of underlying causes as necessary."

   lavage at [**Location (un) 78**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs fluid
   collection, density suspicious for blood, involving the duodenum with
   compression of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation; an

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic aspiration/infection, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.
* She was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum, which was concerning for malignancy.
* The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells during her admission and has been treated with pantoprazole for upper GI bleeding.
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, and an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level.
* The patient has a history of painless jaundice and chalk-colored stools, which is concerning for cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer.
* The patient has a planned ERCP procedure on [**2-15**] for palliative stenting.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding from the duodenal mass, which may lead to further blood loss and hypovolemic shock.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's chronic aspiration/infection and the presence of a mass in the duodenum.
* Progression of the patient's liver dysfunction, which may lead to further elevations in liver enzymes and potential liver failure.
* Development of hyponatremia due to the patient's SIADH or volume overload, which may lead to seizures or other neurological complications.
* Progression of the patient's atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
* Development of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to the patient's chronic aspiration/infection and the presence of a mass in the duodenum.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a mass in the duodenum with dilated common bile duct. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for her conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. Her platelet count is 166,000/μL, and her white blood cell count is 17.6 x 10^9/L. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 151 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 151 IU/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, and she has been receiving anticoagulation therapy with coumadin. However, due to the gastrointestinal bleeding, her anticoagulation therapy has been reversed, and she is being monitored for bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes continued treatment for her upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including proton pump inhibitor therapy and serial hemoglobin checks. She will also continue to receive anticoagulation therapy for her atrial fibrillation once the bleeding has resolved. The patient's code status is do not intubate, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor once her condition stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for further bleeding complications due to her ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and the reversal of her anticoagulation therapy.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of invasive medical devices.
3. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which could worsen her condition and increase her risk of complications.
4. Renal damage: The patient's oliguria may indicate kidney damage, which could worsen her condition and increase her risk of complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygen requirements increase.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presented with upper GI bleeding and a duodenal mass with dilated CBD. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, ibuprofen, aspirin, estrogens, and fosamax. She has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, diltiazem, trazodone, colace, and senna. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving fluids and has had a significant amount of bleeding, with a total output of 700 mL and a balance of 415 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 17.6 K/uL, platelet count of 166 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 182 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with an ALT level of 151 U/L and an AST level of 89 U/L.

The patient's plan includes continuing pantoprazole, holding anticoagulation due to bleeding, and serial Hct checks. She is also being considered for ERCP and palliative stenting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has had significant bleeding and may continue to bleed, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potential cardiac complications.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies and may be at risk for infection, particularly with antibiotics.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which could indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which could indicate kidney dysfunction or damage.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for respiratory complications, particularly with fluid overload.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, particularly with bleeding and fluid overload.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of profound kyphosis and may be at risk for neurological complications, particularly with spinal cord compression.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a duodenal mass and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, particularly with bleeding and obstruction."
