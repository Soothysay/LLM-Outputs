   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given, double coverage with ciprofloxacin 400
   q24 until gram negatives speciated
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Per renal, will check Gent level after HD. If </=1.3, will re-dose
   Gent 60mg IV x 1.
   - Also, renal recs advise keeping HD catheter in, as pt with limited
   availability for alternate HD access. Will consider removing if not
   other source found for bacteremia, and symptoms persist.
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breats u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Will have breast surgery consulted
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain this morning substernal pressure,
   but no signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases
   with inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology.
   - Will repeat EKG this afternoon.
   - Follow serial CE
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and now BP elevated in 170s, and
   episode of BP in 200s last pm.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and  titrate Captopril up
   (currently 6.25mg TID) as tolerated.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Receiving HD today per
   renal.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD today, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presented with uncontrolled hypertension, gram-negative bacteremia, and various symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, substernal chest pressure, and breast tenderness. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure range of 150-210/80-115 mmHg, and a heart rate of 70-84 bpm.

Medical Complications:

1. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure due to the bacteremia. The source of the infection is unclear, but possible sources include the dialysis catheter, peritoneal catheter, or intra-abdominal sites.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Chest pain: The patient's substernal chest pressure may be related to pleuritic etiology or venous clots, which could be a sign of pulmonary embolism or pleurisy.
4. Breast tenderness: The patient's breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots, which could be a sign of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Peritoneal dialysis issues: The patient's peritoneal dialysis effluent has been drained with difficulty, which could be a sign of peritoneal catheter occlusion or peritonitis.
6. Infections: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient has a high risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics: The patient should receive antibiotics to treat the gram-negative bacteremia, and the antibiotics should be adjusted based on the results of the blood cultures.
2. Monitor vital signs: The patient's vital signs should be closely monitored to ensure that her blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation remain stable.
3. Investigate chest pain: The patient's chest pain should be further investigated to determine the underlying cause, and the patient should receive pain management as needed.
4. Manage breast tenderness: The patient's breast tenderness should be managed to prevent further complications, and the patient should receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
5. Review peritoneal dialysis: The patient's peritoneal dialysis should be reviewed to determine the cause of the difficulty in draining the effluent, and the patient should receive prophylaxis for peritonitis.
6. Monitor for infections: The patient should be monitored for signs of infections, and the patient's blood cultures should be repeated as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fatigue. Overnight, they experienced an episode of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which resolved with the administration of Zofran. The patient also had a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 190-210 mmHg, which was treated with Hydralazine and Captopril. The patient underwent a cycle of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and effluent was sent for cell count and culture. The patient has a dialysis catheter in place and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 70-84 bpm, and blood pressure of 162/91 mmHg. The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and has an SpO2 of 90%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine, as well as abnormal liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's C. difficile test is pending, and they have a history of diarrhea, which increases the risk of infection. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver enzymes may indicate a systemic infection.
2. Hypertension: The patient's SBP is still elevated, and they require ongoing antihypertensive therapy to manage their blood pressure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid overnight, and their fluid balance is positive. This may lead to fluid overload and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney injury or worsening kidney function.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction or injury.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 90%, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is still labile, and they require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots.  No
   evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of
   infection given chronicity.
   - Peritioneal dialysate for cell count and cultures
   - continue Gentamicin, double coverage with ciprofloxacin until gram
   negatives speciated
   - Follow gentamicin levels.
   - Surveillance cultures from dialysis catheter and peripheral blood
   cultures
   .
   # Hypertension - Resume atenolol and also started captopril 6.25mg TID,
   uptitrate as tolerated.
   .
   # ESRD - Resume outpatient PD and HD per schedule.  Continue lanthanum,
   sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   .
   # Psych - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:
   .
   # Access: HD catheter and peripheral
   .
   # PPx:  On Warfarin.  Given Vitamin K in case dialysis catheter needs
   to be changed, so will need to start heparin gtt once INR < 2.0.
   .
   # Code:  Full code
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU overnight, then likely call out to [**Doctor Last Name 2504**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3827**] if BP
   stable.

   Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots.  No
   evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of
   infection given chronicity.
   - Peritioneal dialysate for cell count and cultures
   - continue Gentamicin, double coverage with ciprofloxacin until gram
   negatives speciated
   - Follow gentamicin levels.
   - Surveillance cultures from dialysis catheter and peripheral blood
   cultures
   .
   # Hypertension - Resume atenolol and also started captopril 6.25mg TID,
   uptitrate as tolerated.

Summary:

The patient, a 55-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD) and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD), presents with uncontrolled hypertension and Gram-negative bacteremia. She has been experiencing fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with a recent episode of severe hypertension (SBP 190-210s/100-115 mmHg) and headache. She has been treated with Hydralazine and Captopril to control her blood pressure. The patient underwent a cycle of PD last night, and effluent was sent for cell count and culture.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure due to the presence of Gram-negative bacteria in her bloodstream.
2. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and cardiac failure.
3. Dialysis catheter-related complications: The patient's dialysis catheter may be a source of infection, and there is a risk of developing catheter-related sepsis, peritonitis, or other complications.
4. Peritoneal dialysate leakage: The patient's peritoneal dialysate leakage may lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, or other complications.
5. Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's underlying chronic kidney disease may progress, leading to further complications such as uremia, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient may develop secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections, which may worsen her condition.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and Gram-negative bacteremia may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including bacteremia, fever, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and a history of vascular thrombosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypertension, which has improved since reinstatement of home medications and addition of captopril
* Fever, which is likely related to the bacteremia
* Bacteremia, with gram-negative rods growing in blood cultures
* Chronic renal failure, with a recent start of dialysis
* Chest pain, which is worrisome for ischemia, although the ECG is unchanged

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL
* Elevated white blood cell count, with 287 K/uL
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating chronic renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Cardiomegaly on the chest X-ray, with no infiltrates or effusions
* Normal sinus rhythm on the electrocardiogram, with no acute ischemic changes

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue present antibiotics, considering replacement of the dialysis catheter
* Monitor blood pressure closely, with consideration of reinstituting antihypertensive medications
* Check enzymes for evidence of myocardial infarction
* Continue dialysis and monitor electrolyte levels
* Start heparin to prevent thrombosis
* Maintain glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to bacteremia
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, due to hypertension and bacteremia
* Renal failure, which can worsen with continued bacteremia and sepsis
* Vascular complications, such as thrombosis or embolism, due to the patient's history of vascular thrombosis and bacteremia
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting, due to bacteremia and sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity. No
   signs of pulmonary infection clinically.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given ([**6-22**]), double coverage with
   ciprofloxacin 400 q24 ([**6-22**]) until gram negatives speciated. One set of
   cultures show pansensitive.
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Gent level after HD was 2.4. If as >1.3, will hold off on re-dosing
   Gent 60mg IV.
   - Will have HD catheter replaced over wire tomorrow by IR
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breast u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Pending breast surgery consult
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain [**6-23**], substernal pressure, but no
   signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases with
   inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology. Chest
   pain continued overnight to today, described now more like heartburn.
   Improves after Maalox Repeat EKG this a.m. showed no change.  [**Month (only) 60**] be GI
   related.
   - Will repeat EKG as necessary
   - Follow-up on final set of CE
s this a.m.
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Will start PPI daily (hx of PPI use, but d/c
ed in distant for
   unclear reasons)
   - Maalox also for PRN heartburn
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and BP early in stay  elevated in
   170s, and episode of BP in 200s in p.m. [**6-22**]. BP improved after HD and
   regular dosing of BP meds.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and Captopril 6.25 tid, titrate up
   as necessary.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Received HD 7/30 per renal
   as pt unable to do regular PD while line clotted.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD yesterday, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:  Renal diet
   .
   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
s (right hand
   PIV removed, new PIV placed in left hand)
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin.
   - Heparin gtt started [**6-23**] to prevent further IJ thromboses, given
   extensive hx of similar clots. Will adjust as necessary to maintain
   therapeutic levels. Transition to Warfarin if no HD catheter removal
   anticipated prior to discharge.
   - PPI daily.
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Code:  Full code
   .
   # Dispo:  will likely call out to floor today, as symptoms much
   improved and pt hemodynamically stable on current antibiotic regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Will start PPI daily (hx of PPI use, but d/c
ed in distant for
   unclear reasons)
   - Maalox also for PRN heartburn
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and BP early in stay  elevated in
   170s, and episode of BP in 200s in p.m. [**6-22**]. BP improved after HD and
   regular dosing of BP meds.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and Captopril 6.25 tid, titrate up
   as necessary.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Received HD 7/30 per renal
   as pt unable to do regular PD while line clotted.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD yesterday, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:  Renal diet
   .
   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
s (right hand
   PIV removed, new PIV placed in left hand)
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin.
   - Heparin gtt started [**6-23**] to prevent further IJ thromboses, given
   extensive hx of similar clots. Will adjust as necessary to maintain
   therapeutic levels. Transition to Warfarin if no HD catheter removal
   anticipated prior to discharge.
   - PPI daily.
   - Pneumoboots

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD) and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD), hypertension, and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient presents with uncontrolled hypertension, right shoulder pain, chest pain, and left shoulder pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a gram-negative bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a CXR showing RLL opacity, which could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema or focal developing infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of venous clots and is at risk for pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or stroke.
5. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is on HD, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and anemia.
6. Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
7. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain could be related to a cardiac or pulmonary cause, or it could be related to a gastrointestinal cause such as esophagitis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
8. Breast pain: The patient's breast pain could be related to venous clots or it could be related to a different cause such as breast cancer.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her gram-negative bacteremia, hypertension, and chest pain. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is likely to be transferred to the floor once her symptoms improve and she is hemodynamically stable on her current antibiotic regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of fatigue. Overnight, the patient experienced right shoulder pain, which was resolved with Oxycodone. Additionally, the patient reported chest pain, substernal pressure, and described it as feeling like ""heartburn"" or gas, which was improved with Maalox. The patient also complained of left shoulder pain, right hand edema and pain, and discomfort from the peritoneal dialysis (PD) line.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 144/109 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also stable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T levels, indicating possible inflammation, kidney damage, and cardiac injury. Other laboratory results, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolyte levels, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rotator cuff tear: The patient's right shoulder pain may indicate a rotator cuff tear, which requires further evaluation and management.
2. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain, substernal pressure, and ""heartburn"" or gas-like symptoms may indicate cardiac ischemia, pericarditis, or esophageal dysfunction, which requires further evaluation and management.
3. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) line complications: The patient's discomfort from the PD line may indicate complications such as peritonitis, PD catheter malfunction, or inadequate dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and troponin-T levels may indicate a systemic infection, which requires further evaluation and management.
5. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac injury, which requires further evaluation and management.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage, which requires further evaluation and management.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and requires prophylactic measures such as compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, and/or anticoagulation therapy.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration and requires prophylactic measures such as histamine-2 (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors.
9. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and requires prophylactic measures such as semirecumbent positioning, oral care, and/or antibiotic therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given ([**6-22**]), double coverage with
   ciprofloxacin 400 q24 ([**6-22**]) until gram negatives speciated
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Gent level after HD was 2.4. If as >1.3, will hold off on re-dosing
   Gent 60mg IV.
   - Also, renal recs advise keeping HD catheter in, as pt with limited
   availability for alternate HD access. Will consider removing if not
   other source found for bacteremia, and symptoms persist.
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breats u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Pending breast surgery consult
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain [**6-23**], substernal pressure, but no
   signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases with
   inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology. Chest
   pain continued overnight to today, described now more like heartburn.
   Improves after Maalox Repeat EKG this a.m. showed no change.  [**Month (only) 60**] be GI
   related.
   - Will repeat EKG as necessary
   - Follow-up on final set of CE
s this a.m.
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Maalox for possible heartburn-type pain
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and now BP elevated in 170s, and
   episode of BP in 200s in p.m. [**6-22**]. BP improved over yesterday after HD
   and regular dosing of BP meds.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and Captopril 6.25 tid, titrate up
   as necessary.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Received HD 7/30 per renal
   as pt unable to do regular PD while line clotted.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD yesterday, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram

   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin

   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin. Heparing gtt started [**6-23**] to prevent
   further IJ thromboses, given extensive hx of similar clots. Will adjust
   as necessary to maintain therapeutic levels. ?Transition to Warfarin if
   no HD catheter removal anticipated prior to discharge.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), hypertension, and gram-negative bacteremia. She has a history of rotator cuff tear, breast tenderness, and chronic pain. She is currently experiencing right shoulder pain, left shoulder pain, and substernal chest pain, which is suspected to be related to a pleuritic etiology. She has also reported feeling tubing of the PD line on the inside of her abdomen and right hand edema and pain on the dorsum of the IV site.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it is essential to continue monitoring and adjusting her medications to achieve optimal control.
2. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture, and it is crucial to identify the source of the infection and treat it promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Pleuritic chest pain: The patient's chest pain is suspected to be related to a pleuritic etiology, and it is essential to continue monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary.
4. Right shoulder pain: The patient's right shoulder pain is likely related to her rotator cuff tear, and it is essential to continue monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary.
5. Left shoulder pain: The patient's left shoulder pain is new and requires further evaluation to determine its cause and appropriate treatment.
6. Breast tenderness: The patient's breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots. It is essential to continue monitoring her symptoms and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled, and it is essential to continue monitoring and adjusting her medications to achieve optimal control.
8. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD is a significant comorbidity, and it is essential to continue monitoring her kidney function and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary.
9. Infection: The patient's gram-negative bacteremia requires prompt treatment and monitoring to prevent further complications.
10. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's elevated risk of pulmonary embolism due to her ESRD and immobility requires close monitoring and prophylactic measures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medications as necessary to achieve optimal control.
2. Identify and treat the source of the gram-negative bacteremia promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's chest pain and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to manage her symptoms.
4. Evaluate the patient's left shoulder pain and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to determine its cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's breast tenderness and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to manage her symptoms.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to manage her ESRD.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent pulmonary embolism, such as anticoagulation therapy and early mobilization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) through a tunneled catheter, who presented with bacteremia likely caused by a line infection. She has hypertension and recurrent chest pain, which has been relieved with Maalox. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/87 mmHg and a heart rate of 66 bpm. Her respiratory support is minimal, with an SpO2 of 97%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for the presence of a tunneled catheter in her abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line infection: The patient's bacteremia is likely caused by a line infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can increase her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
3. Chest pain: The patient's recurrent chest pain may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a pulmonary embolism or a myocardial infarction.
4. Kidney disease: The patient's ESRD can lead to chronic kidney disease, which can increase her risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
5. Dialysis catheter complications: The patient's tunneled dialysis catheter can become infected or occluded, leading to complications such as sepsis, dialysis access failure, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Antimicrobial resistance: The patient's bacteremia is caused by a GNR (Gram-negative rod), which can develop antimicrobial resistance, making it difficult to treat.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's ESRD can increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Plan:

1. Continue gentamicin for presumed line infection.
2. Stop ciprofloxacin and consider double-covering with another antibiotic.
3. Defer to renal whether the line needs to be changed.
4. Continue atenolol and caproptil for blood pressure control.
5. Declot the patient's pd catheter using tPA.
6. Continue heparin gtt for clots.
7. Restart ppi for presumed GERD and further evaluate as an outpatient.
8. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
9. Consider transferring the patient to the floor for further evaluation and management."
