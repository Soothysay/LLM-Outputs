You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old man admitted to the MICU with a chief complaint of intracranial hemorrhage. He has a significant cardiac history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a pacemaker. He presented with a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, with multiple foci of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and new right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's condition has worsened compared to the previous CT scan. He is receiving vitamin K, profiline, and fresh frozen plasma, and neurosurgery is planned. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, but he is at risk for syncope and cardiac arrhythmias. He has a history of chronic kidney disease and is being treated with darbepoetin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's worsening subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage put him at risk for increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to brain herniation and death.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and high risk of syncope increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury from the hemorrhage put him at risk for renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central nervous system (CNS) injury increase his risk for infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infection.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and history of chronic kidney disease increase his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for oxygen therapy and potential for respiratory failure from the hemorrhage and potential for aspiration put him at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's worsening neurological status and potential for further hemorrhage or edema put him at risk for neurological deterioration, which can lead to permanent disability or death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   clinical concern for fracture, dedicated maxillofacial CT scan
   suggested.
   CT (~6a): ""little change from 11 hrs prior in multicompartmental
   intracranial hemorrhage""
   Assessment and Plan
   87-year-old man with substantial cardiac history (CAD, Afib on
   warfarin, pacemaker vs. ICD) now presents with traumatic SAH.
   SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
   - received vitamin K, profiline, and FFP
   - neurosurgery following
   - prelim read of CT after about 11 hours was there was no change; will
   d/w neurosurg
   - BP is well controlled without specific therapy
   - continue dilantin prophylactically
   - will discuss with neurosurgery regarding best approach to monitoring
   and therpay
   SYNCOPE (POSSIBLE)
   - not completely clear if this was syncope or a mechanical fall but
   proceding under assumption that it was.  Certainly EKG and device
   suggests high risk.
   - echo today
   - telemetry
   - infectious workup
   - ask EP to interrogate device
   ARF vs. CKD
   - on darbepoeitin chronically, so suspect there is chronic kidney
   disease as well
   - will attempt to get old records
   CAD
   - hold on aspirin for now until SAH cleared
   AFIB
   - off anticoag for now
   Will attempt to get old records
   Other issues as per ICU team note.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can arise:

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old man with a substantial cardiac history, including CAD, Afib on warfarin, and a pacemaker. He presented with traumatic SAH and has been admitted to the MICU. The patient's condition has worsened, with new right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma. He is currently receiving vitamin K, profiline, and FFP, and will undergo neurosurgery. The patient is also being monitored for syncope, ARF, and CKD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's worsening SAH and new intraparenchymal hemorrhage increase the risk of ICP, which can lead to brain herniation, coma, and death.
2. Seizures: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage increase the risk of seizures, which can be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history, including CAD and Afib, increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status, including the need for oxygen therapy, increases the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator dependence and mortality.
5. Sepsis: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and possible ARF increase the risk of renal failure, which can lead to end-stage renal disease and mortality.
8. Infectious Complications: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma increase the risk of infectious complications, such as meningitis and abscesses, which can lead to morbidity and mortality."

   HEAD CT:
   Slight interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
   right
   temporoparietal region. Slight increase in the amount of blood layering
   dependently in the lateral ventricles. Otherwise, no interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range); need repeat
   albumin to further determine level
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -touch base with neurosurgery to determine need for Q2 neurochecks
   -neurosurgery recs suggest no coumadin for at least 30 days; risk of
   embolus per month is low.  Needs follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**]
   ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**]) in 4 weeks, will need noncontrast head CT beforehand.
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   8) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now
   9) PPx: Pneumoboots, Oral PPI
   10) Code: Full
   11) Dispo: pending neuro stability

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range); need repeat
   albumin to further determine level
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -touch base with neurosurgery to determine need for Q2 neurochecks
   -neurosurgery recs suggest no coumadin for at least 30 days; risk of
   embolus per month is low.  Needs follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**]
   ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**]) in 4 weeks, will need noncontrast head CT beforehand.

   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with known multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation (AF) on chronic anticoagulation, who presented after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient remains neurologically intact, but the exact mechanism of the fall is unclear.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. **Re-bleeding**: The patient's SAH has increased in size, and there is a risk of re-bleeding, which can lead to further neurological damage or even death.
2. **Cardiac complications**: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF). The use of beta blockers may be necessary to control heart rate and blood pressure, but this may need to be balanced against the risk of bleeding.
3. **Coagulopathy**: The patient's INR is currently at goal, but there is a risk of bleeding due to the reversal of coagulation. The patient will need to be monitored closely for signs of bleeding.
4. **Infection**: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterococcus, which may require antibiotic treatment. There is also a risk of pneumonia or other infections due to the patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions.
5. **Kidney injury**: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate kidney injury. The patient will need to be monitored for signs of worsening kidney function.
6. **Nutritional deficiencies**: The patient's diet is restricted due to the risk of bleeding, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not addressed.
7. **Pulmonary complications**: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the risk of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
8. **Neurological complications**: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate due to the risk of re-bleeding, infection, or other complications.
9. **Cardiac arrhythmias**: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) may worsen or develop other cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to further complications.
10. **Cognitive decline**: The patient's cognitive function may decline due to the risk of bleeding, infection, or other complications.

The patient's care plan should prioritize monitoring for these potential complications and addressing them promptly if they arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   2) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3.  Now reversed to 1.2 s/p 2 units FFP
   -will continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   3) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   4) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   5) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   6) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   2) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3.  Now reversed to 1.2 s/p 2 units FFP

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic anticoagulation. He presented to the hospital after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. He is receiving cardiac medications, including lopressor and dilantin, and is being monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level, indicating possible cardiac injury. His creatinine level is slightly elevated, and he is receiving darbepoetin, which may indicate chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure or bleeding. He is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of AF and chronic anticoagulation, combined with his current SAH, increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac arrest.
2. Neurologic complications: The patient's SAH and possible concussion/head trauma may increase his risk of neurologic complications, such as seizures, intracranial bleeding, or cerebral edema.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of CKD may increase his risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's SAH and possible respiratory depression may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of chronic anticoagulation and possible bleeding may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
6. Infection: The patient's SAH and possible respiratory depression may increase his risk of infection, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of chronic anticoagulation and possible bleeding may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage, hematoma, or bleeding into the brain.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and neurologic examination. Further evaluation and management of his cardiac, neurologic, renal, and respiratory systems are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   -cardiology was consulted regarding his weird bypass of AoV. They said:
   re afib (would bblock if HR >120, aiming for bp per neurosurg). ok to
   not be on coumadin for afib. Re bypass graft ask [**Hospital1 49**] why it was placed,
   but regardless, would not anticoagulate for now. Monitor for emboli to
   legs as this is where they would go from the conduit. also give lasix
   for chf.
   -cards wanted op report from [**Hospital1 **] which is now in his chart under osh
   records. the op procedure was left thoracotomy and left ventricular
   apex-to-descending aortic valve conduit.
   -started lopressor 12.5 tid for goal HR <120s and goal SBP 100-140,
   could titrate up prn or switch to carvedilol (his home med). I liked
   that lopressor was a little shorter acting for now.
   -neurosurg would like head CT in am before their rounds rather than
   this evening. will need to talk to neurosurg at some point soon about
   when to restart coumadin.
   -called micro lab to confirm they are testing sensitivities on
   enterococcus from urine, which they are
   -per daughter, pt on O2 at baseline and incontinent at home. may need

   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   HEAD CT:
   Slight interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
   right
   temporoparietal region. Slight increase in the amount of blood layering
   dependently in the lateral ventricles. Otherwise, no interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   8) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now
   9) PPx: Pneumoboots, Oral PPI
   10) Code: Full
   11) Dispo: pending neuro stability

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has a slight interval increase in size of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region, which may lead to further bleeding, hydrocephalus, or brain edema.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's HR is 104 bpm, which is above the target range of <120 bpm. This may lead to tachycardia, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is currently at goal, but the physician plans to hold coumadin in the setting of SAH. This may lead to increased risk of bleeding.
4. Hypotension: The patient had a brief episode of hypotension to 80's in the ED, which responded well to small amounts of IV fluids. However, the patient's current BP is 123/78 mmHg, which may indicate ongoing hypotension.
5. CKD: The patient's creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney dysfunction. The patient's darbepoetin use and potential prerenal azotemia may exacerbate this condition.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's INR is currently at goal, but the physician plans to hold coumadin in the setting of SAH. This may lead to increased risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 96%, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
8. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is currently intact, but the patient's SAH and potential vasospasm may lead to neurological deterioration.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status is unclear, and the patient's LV hypokinesis may indicate cardiac dysfunction. The patient's tachycardia and potential vasospasm may exacerbate this condition.

The patient's medications, including the hold on coumadin, may need to be adjusted to manage these potential complications. The patient's laboratory results, including the creatinine level, may need to be monitored closely to assess kidney function. The patient's neurological status and cardiac function will need to be closely monitored to assess for any signs of deterioration."
