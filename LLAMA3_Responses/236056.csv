   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION - Patient is unclear on what medications he is on,
   but reports taking diltiazem in spite of having been told to stop
   this.  He also reports feeling weak and lightheaded since discharge.
   Most likely etiology of his bradycardia and syncope is nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   overdose.  Other possibilities include vasovagal episode or
   hypoglycemia (although admission FS was 461), arrhythmia, and
   dehydration.  Seizure unlikely given story and cardiac medications.
   Ischemia unlikely, especially with negative enzymes.  Currently on
   dopamine gtt.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated.  Goal MAP > 65, HR > 50
   - Hold beta-blocker and CCB while bradycardic
   - Orthostatic vitals
   - PT consult
   - Monitor on telemetry
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Rate control with metoprolol as needed, will hold for now given
   dopamine requirement
   - Plan for ablation, will decide on date.
   - continue coumadin
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP - No evidence of CHF on recent echo.  Has trace crackles on exam
   and chronic appearing lower extremity edema.  S/P 3L IVF at [**Hospital 1097**]
   hosp.
   - Watch O2 requirement
   - consider CXR
   BIPOLAR DISORDER - Patient on Geodon as outpatient. Concern that may be
   contributing to his bradycardia (known side effect of the medication).
   Will continue to hold for now.
   - consider psych c/s in AM
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine on discharge of 1.4, now
   2.6.  Likely related to decreased perfusion in setting of hypotension.
   Also may represent dehydration or ACEI overdose.  Did not improve with
   3L of IVF at [**Hospital1 1097**].
   - urine lytes and UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if not improving
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol
   .
   HYPERKALEMIA - resolved at OSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] reflect renal dysfunction, but
   does not appear to be severe.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fib, and type 2 diabetes. He presented to the ICU with a syncopal episode, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient is unclear on his medication regimen, but reports taking diltiazem despite being advised to stop.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 95/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His cardiac rhythm is atrial flutter. He has a history of atrial flutter/fib, which was diagnosed on his last admission and was being anticoagulated with plans for ablation in three weeks.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5, hemoglobin of 30.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 163 K/uL. His creatinine has increased from 1.4 to 2.6 mg/dL, likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Nodal overdose: The patient's bradycardia and syncope may be caused by nodal overdose, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and recent syncopal episode make hypoglycemia a possible complication.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient's atrial flutter/fib could worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
4. Dehydration: The patient's increased creatinine and decreased urine output suggest dehydration, which could worsen his condition.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's increased creatinine and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 94% and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make respiratory failure a possible complication.
7. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and history of pneumonia make sepsis a possible complication.

The patient's plan of care includes weaning dopamine as tolerated, holding beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, and monitoring on telemetry. The patient will also undergo a barium swallow to evaluate for possible esophageal pathology and will be continued on coumadin for anticoagulation."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION - Patient is unclear on what medications he is on,
   but reports taking diltiazem in spite of having been told to stop
   this.  He also reports feeling weak and lightheaded since discharge.
   Most likely etiology of his bradycardia and syncope is nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   overdose.  Other possibilities include vasovagal episode or
   hypoglycemia (although admission FS was 461), arrhythmia, and
   dehydration.  Seizure unlikely given story and cardiac medications.
   Ischemia unlikely, especially with negative enzymes.  Currently off
   dopamine gtt.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] restart beta-blocker slowly as needed for HR control.
   - Goal to ablate on this admission.  Will do TEE under sedation and
   discuss with EP regarding ablation.
   - Orthostatic vitals
   - PT consult
   - Monitor on telemetry
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Rate control with metoprolol as needed, will hold for now given
   dopamine requirement
   - Plan for ablation this week.
   - continue coumadin
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP - No evidence of CHF on recent echo.  Has trace crackles on exam
   and chronic appearing lower extremity edema.  S/P 3L IVF at [**Hospital 1097**]
   hosp.  Has mild O2 req and outside CXR shows volume o/l.
   - 40 mg IV lasix
   BIPOLAR DISORDER - Patient on Geodon as outpatient. Concern that may be
   contributing to his bradycardia (known side effect of the medication).
   Will continue to hold for now.
   - consider psych c/s in AM
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine on discharge of 1.4, now
   2.6.  Likely related to decreased perfusion in setting of hypotension.
   Also may represent dehydration or ACEI overdose.  Did not improve with
   3L of IVF at [**Hospital1 1097**].
   - urine lytes and UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if not improving
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fib, and type 2 diabetes, who presents to the ICU after a syncopal episode with bradycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic (98 bpm), blood pressure (95/73 mmHg), and oxygen saturation (94%).
* Heart rhythm: Atrial flutter.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery.
* Neurological examination: CN2-12 grossly intact, strength 5/5.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
	+ Hematocrit: 30.9%
	+ Platelet count: 163 K/uL
	+ White blood cell count: 9.5 K/uL
	+ Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mEq/L
	+ Sodium: 135 mEq/L
	+ Potassium: 4.6 mEq/L
	+ Glucose: 177 mg/dL
* Medical history:
	+ Previous admission with atrial flutter/fib and plan for ablation.
	+ History of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
	+ Current medications: Geodon, metoprolol, simvastatin, allopurinol, and pantoprazole.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to nodal overdose, vasovagal episode, hypoglycemia, arrhythmia, or dehydration.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to decreased perfusion, dehydration, or ACEI overdose.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.4 to 2.6 mg/dL, which may be related to decreased perfusion, dehydration, or ACEI overdose.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may be related to renal dysfunction or other medical conditions.
5. Gout: The patient's allopurinol medication may need to be adjusted or stopped due to the risk of hyperkalemia.
6. BPH: The patient's terazosin medication may need to be held due to hypotension.
7. Bipolar disorder: The patient's Geodon medication may need to be adjusted or stopped due to the risk of bradycardia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Restart beta-blocker slowly as needed for HR control.
2. Monitor on telemetry.
3. Plan for ablation this week.
4. Continue coumadin.
5. Barium swallow to evaluate for possible esophageal pathology.
6. Consider psych consult in the morning.
7. Monitor urine lytes and UA.
8. Consider renal ultrasound if not improving.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION
 Secondary to AV node blockade by incorrect med
   regimen for Aflutter.
   - Currently off dopamine gtt.
   - Started BB slowly but did not respond until got 25 + 12 +25 of
   Metoprolol. Will change standing dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]>
   -  TEE neg for vegetations, plan to ablate once INR low enough. NPO
   today and d/w EP.
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Barium swallow and TEE normal, plan for ablation once INR low enough.
   - BB for rate control as needed.
   - Coumadin held, Heparin started for ablation
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP
 S/P 3L IVF at OSH, now very negative after 2 doses of IV Lasix
   40mg.  Cr stable so seems to have tolerated well.
   BIPOLAR DISORDER -  Restarted Geodon as etiology of bradycardia is
   likely AV node blockade.
   - Received PM dose and tolerated well.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine baseline 1.4, peaked at
   2.6, now 2.1.  Has not improved in last 24 hrs, ? because
   overdiuresing. Would favor allowing pt to balance himself out.
   DIABETES TYPE 2:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fib, and type 2 diabetes who presented to the ICU with a syncopal episode, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient was found to have an atrial flutter and was started on heparin drip, off coumadin, and was given multiple doses of metoprolol for rate control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 118/91 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for 2+ pitting edema to the ankles.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 30.8%
* Platelet count: 167 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 105 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Atrial flutter/fib
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Type 2 diabetes
* Bipolar disorder
* Gout
* BPH

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Ablation for atrial flutter/fib once INR is low enough
* Barium swallow to evaluate for possible esophageal pathology
* Coumadin held, Heparin started for ablation
* Restarted Geodon for bipolar disorder
* Holding terazosin due to hypotension
* Continuing allopurinol at a lower dose due to renal failure
* Diabetic/cardiac diet
* PIVs for access
* PPI and Hep drip for prophylaxis
* Full code status
* Called out to the floor but no beds available

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued hypotension and bradycardia
* Worsening of atrial flutter/fib
* Acute kidney injury
* Hypoglycemia due to diabetes
* Psychiatric complications due to bipolar disorder
* Gout flare-ups
* BPH symptoms
* Renal failure exacerbation due to overdiuresis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 69-inch elderly male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of unknown. He has undergone a transesophageal echo at 12:00 PM on 11/7/2196, with medication administration of fentanyl 50mcq and versed 1.5mg. He has a history of allergies to Ciprofloxacin, Sulfa, Penicillins, and Nut Flavor, and is receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 118/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He has a regular atrial flutter rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure of 9 cm, regular rhythm with a tachycardic rate, and bilateral crackles and mild wheezes at the bases of the lungs. He has 2+ pitting edema at the ankles and distal pulses are 1+.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 186 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen is 105 mg/dL, creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL, and glucose is 177 mg/dL. Other laboratory results include a prothrombin time of 24.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time of 85.7 seconds, and international normalized ratio of 2.4.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a total fluid intake of 1,687 mL, with 431 mL of that being IV fluid. His urine output is 5,150 mL, and he has received a total of 5,150 mL of blood products.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral crackles and mild wheezes at the bases of the lungs may indicate underlying respiratory disease, which could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter rhythm may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias if not properly managed.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid intake and urine output may indicate fluid overload, which could lead to cardiac failure, respiratory failure, or other complications if not properly managed.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is 186 K/uL, which may indicate a risk of bleeding complications if the patient undergoes invasive procedures or has a traumatic injury.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL may indicate underlying kidney disease, which could lead to renal failure if not properly managed.

In summary, the patient is an elderly male with a history of allergies and underlying medical conditions, who is currently receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium and other ICU medications. He has stable vital signs, but is at risk for respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, fluid overload, bleeding complications, and renal failure."
