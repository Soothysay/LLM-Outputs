   initiation of coumadin, who presents with BRBPR, and a significant drop
   in hematocrit
   #. GI bleed: Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, but no known liver disease.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31,
   now stable Hct but continued melanotic stool.  INR now 1.2, given Vit K
   but no FFP.  Lactate normalized.
   - Colonoscopy today
   - Maintain access with two large bore PIVs
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - q4H Hct
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding

   - continue IV PPI
   -Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70%.  Given DNI code status, cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG, HR stable overnight on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for a gastrointestinal bleed, suspected to be from the lower GI tract, with a possible source of bleeding in the hepatic flexure or duodenum. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was recently initiated on coumadin. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells, with her hematocrit increasing from 16 to 31. She is currently stable, but continues to have melanotic stools. She has also been diagnosed with respiratory distress, which was improved with the administration of lasix. The patient has a history of chronic diastolic dysfunction and has been prescribed beta blockers, which are currently being held due to the acute bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's bleeding has been stabilized, but there is still a risk of further bleeding, particularly if the source of bleeding is not identified and treated.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if she continues to have fluid overload or if her bleeding is not controlled.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent episode of Mobitz type II heart block increase her risk of developing further arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of an acute bleed.
4. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of demand ischemia, which may worsen if the patient's bleeding is not controlled.
5. Infection: The patient's GI bleed and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Organ failure: The patient's chronic diastolic dysfunction and acute bleed may increase her risk of developing organ failure, particularly in the kidneys or liver.
7. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's continued bleeding and fluid overload increase her risk of developing hemorrhagic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's bleeding, respiratory status, and cardiac function, and to address any further complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a PMH of atrial fibrillation and recent initiation of coumadin, who presents with BRBPR and a significant drop in hematocrit. She has a suspected GI bleed, with initial brisk presentation and continued melena. A tagged RBC scan suggests bleeding in the RUQ, either at the hepatic flexure or duodenum. She has transaminitis with ascites on CT, but no known liver disease. She has received 6 units of pRBC with an Hct of 16-31, and is now stable but with continued melena. Her INR is 1.2, and she has been given Vitamin K but not FFP. Her lactate has normalized.

The patient has respiratory distress, with tachypnea and SOB during blood transfusion, which improved with lasix 10mg. She has abnormal LFTs, with elevated levels of ALT, AST, and Alk Phos, which may be due to congestion, shock liver, or acute inflammation. She has a transient episode of Mobitz type II heart block, which has resolved. She has EKG changes, including a new STD in anterior-lateral leads, with troponins 0.02-0.08, which may be due to demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue, leading to further blood loss, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by fluid overload and chronic diastolic dysfunction.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's abnormal EKG changes and transient heart block may indicate cardiac complications, such as demand ischemia, which could lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal LFTs may indicate liver failure or dysfunction, which could lead to further complications, such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and sepsis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's suspected GI bleed and abnormal LFTs may increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may exacerbate her symptoms and increase the risk of complications, such as heart failure and cognitive impairment.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to hyperglycemia, which could increase the risk of complications, such as ketoacidosis and nephropathy.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to further complications, such as cardiac failure, stroke, and nephropathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleed and respiratory status closely.
2. Administer lasix 10mg every 2 units of pRBC or symptomatically to manage fluid overload.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU), if her cardiac complications worsen.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider transferring her to a liver transplant center if her liver failure worsens.
5. Consider administering FFP if the patient's INR remains elevated.
6. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels closely and adjust her insulin sensitivity accordingly.
7. Consider consulting a cardiologist to manage the patient's cardiac complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust her levothyroxine dose as needed.
9. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to manage the patient's suspected GI bleed."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, now with changes
   this am concerning for acute stroke, currently getting  CTA head/neck
   with brain perfusion.
   #. Stroke: Very concerning findings this am with aphasia, R
   hemiparesis. Unclear etiology. Pt not recorded as having gone into our
   out of AFib and threw a clot.
   --F/u CTA that pt is getting emergently right now
   --F/u with Neuro who is on board
   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   but no known liver disease.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now
   stable Hct and no further melanotic/red stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit
   K but no FFP.  Lactate normalized.
   - Continue q4 Hcts
   - Maintain access with two large bore PIVs
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch --> send for T&S this am
   - Has 4U crossmatched
   - q4H Hct
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   -Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili--With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   --F/u EKG this am
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Concern for demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   --F/u EKG this am
   #. Chronic diastolic dysfunction: No active issues, will monitor volume
   status during resuscitation.  BB on hold in the setting of acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.
   --Will need to call pharmacy as daughters not aware of pt's med list

   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   #. Diabetes type II: ISS, elevated bs to 300s
   - adjust ISS
   #. HTN: Holding antihypertensives as above
   #. FEN: NPO
   #. PPX:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, now with changes
   this am concerning for acute stroke, currently getting  CTA head/neck
   with brain perfusion.
   #. Stroke: Very concerning findings this am with aphasia, R
   hemiparesis. Unclear etiology. Pt not recorded as having gone into our
   out of AFib and threw a clot.
   --F/u CTA that pt is getting emergently right now
   --F/u with Neuro who is on board
   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   but no known liver disease.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now
   stable Hct and no further melanotic/red stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit
   K but no FFP.  Lactate normalized.

   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and recent initiation of coumadin. The patient's bleeding was not able to be localized during colonoscopy, and she was found to have a dilated CBD measuring 15mm on CT scan.

The patient has developed concerning findings this morning, including aphasia, right hemiparesis, and weeping, which are indicative of a possible acute stroke. The patient's Hct was stable through yesterday, but has now decreased to 32.3. The patient's lactate level has normalized, and her transaminases are elevated.

The patient has also developed respiratory distress, which was managed with lasix and improved breathing. The patient's arrhythmia episode has resolved, but the patient's EKG shows new STD in anterior-lateral leads, and troponins are elevated.

The patient's chronic diastolic dysfunction is being monitored, and beta blockers are being held in the setting of acute bleeding. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being monitored, and amiodarone is not on the patient's medication list. The patient's hypothyroidism and diabetes type II are being managed, and the patient's hypertension is being held.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient's emergency contact is the daughter, who is also the patient's HCP. The patient's disposition is ICU, with follow-up with stroke and gastroenterology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Acute stroke with potential for permanent neurological damage or death
* Gastrointestinal bleeding with potential for continued bleeding, anemia, and organ damage
* Respiratory distress with potential for respiratory failure and death
* Arrhythmia with potential for cardiac arrest and death
* Chronic diastolic dysfunction with potential for further cardiac damage and death
* Hypothyroidism with potential for further thyroid dysfunction and death
* Diabetes type II with potential for further metabolic complications and death
* Hypertension with potential for further cardiovascular complications and death

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care for any potential stroke
* Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with fluids, blood transfusions, and medication
* Provide respiratory support and manage the patient's respiratory distress
* Monitor the patient's arrhythmia and provide anti-arrhythmic medication as needed
* Monitor the patient's chronic diastolic dysfunction and provide supportive care as needed
* Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and diabetes type II and provide medication as needed
* Monitor the patient's hypertension and provide medication as needed
* Consider performing an MRI to further evaluate the patient's stroke
* Consider performing an ERCP to further evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
* Consider performing a CT scan to further evaluate the patient's chronic diastolic dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and transaminitis/ascites.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB). She has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation with recent initiation of coumadin. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which was unable to localize the bleeding source, and was found to have blood throughout the colon. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, and she has been receiving blood transfusions. She was also found to have transaminitis, ascites, and a dilated CBD measuring 15mm on CT scan.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/68 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. She has a small right-sided pleural effusion and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC of 7.6-9.9 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with an ALT of 123 IU/L and an AST of 91 IU/L. Her creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen level is 27 mg/dL. Her troponin level is 0.08 ng/mL, and her lactate level is 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is receiving ICU care. She is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and she is at risk for further bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is a concern, as it may be related to her GI bleed or other underlying medical conditions.
3. Ascites: The patient's ascites is a complication of her GI bleed and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Dilated CBD: The patient's dilated CBD is a concern, as it may be related to her GI bleed or other underlying medical conditions.
5. Pleural effusion: The patient's small right-sided pleural effusion is a complication of her GI bleed and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is at risk for further respiratory distress if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac status is uncertain, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications if not managed properly.
8. Stroke: The patient's stroke is a concern, as it may be related to her GI bleed or other underlying medical conditions.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of her GI bleed and ascites.
10. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, and she is at risk for further hemodynamic instability if not managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, now with changes
   this am concerning for acute stroke, currently getting  CTA head/neck
   with brain perfusion.
   #. Stroke: Very concerning findings this am with aphasia, R
   hemiparesis. Unclear etiology but pt possibly had PAF and threw a mural
   thrombus into cerebral vasculature. However, pt not recorded as having
   gone into AF, and f/u EKG this am in SR.
   --F/u CTA that pt is getting emergently right now
   --F/u with Neuro who is on board
   --Started on Hep gtt without initial bolus
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   --Bubble study today
   #. GI bleed: Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to
   follow Hcts and make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to
   go to IR for likely embolization. Hcts were stable through yesterday.
   Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial brisk
   presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests hepatic
   flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites on CT,
   so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and transaminitis/ascites.
   S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable Hct and no further
   melanotic/red stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.  Lactate
   normalized.
   - Continue q4 Hcts
   - Maintain access with two large bore [**Name (NI) 1416**]
 pt also to get power PICC
   today
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch --> send for T&S this am
   - Has 4U crossmatched
   - q4H Hct
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   -Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili--With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   --F/u EKG this am
 No evidence of any arrhythmia, is in sinus.
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Concern for demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   --F/u EKG this am
 No concerning ST changes this am.
   #. Chronic diastolic dysfunction: No active issues, will monitor volume
   status during resuscitation.  BB on hold in the setting of acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.
   --Will need to call pharmacy as daughters not aware of pt's med list

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who presented with BRBPR, GIB, and was unable to assess the bleeding source. She had a stroke with aphasia and right hemiparesis, and was started on heparin gtt without an initial bolus. The patient also had a GI bleed, which is unclear in origin, and was given 6 units of PRBC with a Hct of 16-31, which is now stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Stroke: The patient's stroke is a significant concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology and extent of the damage. Potential complications include cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or further ischemic events.
2. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source and extent of the bleeding. Potential complications include hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of fluid overload. Potential complications include pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Arrhythmia: The patient's arrhythmia is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and extent of the arrhythmia. Potential complications include cardiac arrest, stroke, or heart failure.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the condition. Potential complications include hypothyroidism-related symptoms such as fatigue, cold intolerance, or dry skin.
6. Diabetes type II: The patient's diabetes type II is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the condition. Potential complications include hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis.
7. HTN: The patient's HTN is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the condition. Potential complications include cardiac failure, stroke, or renal failure.
8. Chronic diastolic dysfunction: The patient's chronic diastolic dysfunction is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the condition. Potential complications include cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, or arrhythmia.

Based on the patient's conditions and potential complications, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored in the ICU, with frequent assessments of her stroke, GI bleed, fluid status, arrhythmia, and other conditions. Further evaluation and treatment should be guided by the patient's clinical status and laboratory results."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili--With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG now in sinus, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.
   --Will need to call pharmacy as daughters not aware of pt's med list

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili--With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG now in sinus, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a code stroke, presenting with flaccid paralysis of the right side, aphasia, and a negative CT head and CTA. She was found to have mild to moderate atherosclerotic disease without high-grade stenoses on CT head/neck. She also had a GI bleed, with two maroon stools in 24 hours, and was found to have transaminitis and ascites on CT. She was stabilized with 6 units of packed red blood cells and was started on heparin for TIA. She also had respiratory distress, arrhythmia, and EKG changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is a significant concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of the bleeding. The patient's INR is 1.1, and she has received Vitamin K, but no FFP. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require angiography if the bleeding is brisk.
2. Stroke: The patient's stroke is a significant concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the damage. She has been started on heparin, and her neurology team is following her closely.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely related to fluid overload, and she is at risk for further respiratory compromise. She has been given lasix, and her fluid status will need to be closely monitored.
4. Arrhythmia: The patient's arrhythmia is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the arrhythmia. She has been started on heparin, and her cardiology team is following her closely.
5. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG changes are a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the changes. She has been started on heparin, and her cardiology team is following her closely.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is a concern, and her thyroid hormone levels will need to be closely monitored.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is a concern, and her blood sugar levels will need to be closely monitored.
8. HTN: The patient's HTN is a concern, and her blood pressure will need to be closely monitored.
9. FEN: The patient's FEN is a concern, and her nutrition will need to be closely monitored.
10. DVT ppx: The patient's DVT ppx is a concern, and she will need to be closely monitored for signs of DVT.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and further evaluation are needed to determine the best course of treatment."

   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: re repeat colonoscopy given chornic anemia
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI

   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   # Knee Pain: apparent effusion.  Concern for hemarthrosis given on
   heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided paralysis.
   - hold heparin to tap knee to eval for hemarthrosis
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: re repeat colonoscopy given chornic anemia
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   # Knee Pain: apparent effusion.  Concern for hemarthrosis given on
   heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided paralysis.
   - hold heparin to tap knee to eval for hemarthrosis
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG now in sinus, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.

Based on the progress note, the patient, a 74-year-old female, has been admitted to the ICU with a code stroke, which has resolved with some residual symptoms. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes type II.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/56 mmHg.
* Neurological status: improved from the stroke, with some residual symptoms.
* Gastrointestinal status: she has had two maroon stools in 24 hours, and a suspected lower GI bleed is being investigated.
* Respiratory status: she has tachypnea and SOB during blood transfusion, which has been managed with lasix.
* Cardiac status: she has had an episode of Mobitz type II heart block, which has resolved.
* Laboratory results: her Hct is stable, and her INR is 1.1. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated transaminases and bilirubin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Re-bleeding from the suspected lower GI bleed
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to fluid overload
* Prolonged or worsening of the patient's respiratory distress
* Further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure
* Development of sepsis or other infections
* Prolonged or worsening of the patient's neurological symptoms

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued monitoring of her neurological and gastrointestinal status
* Further investigation of the suspected lower GI bleed
* Management of her respiratory distress with lasix and oxygen therapy
* Cardiac monitoring and management of any arrhythmias
* Management of her liver function test abnormalities
* Consideration of MRCP to assess the ampulla for any potential mass
* Further evaluation of the patient's thyroid function and autoimmune hepatitis panel

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she has a power of attorney for healthcare decision-making."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck.
   #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --F/u neuro recs re anticoagulation
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: re repeat colonoscopy given chornic anemia
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen, has 4 units crossed
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider MRCP once pt stable
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel
   # Knee Pain: apparent effusion.  Concern for hemarthrosis given on
   heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided paralysis.
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with tachypnea and SOB during blood
   transfusion, given lasix 10mg x3 in between transfusions with improved
   breathing.  Likely component of fluid overload as demonstrated on CXR
   from chronic diastolic dysfunction, however last ECHO from [**8-19**] with EF
   >70% however could have significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 767**] DNI code status,
   cautious with fluids.
   - If requires futher resuscitation, give 10mg lasix for every 2 units
   prbc or symptomatically.
   #. Arrhythmia: Patient with a transient epidsode of what sounds like
   Mobitz type II heart block, now resolved.  No evidence of heart block
   on rechecked EKG now in sinus, HR stable overnight on tele.
   -  Beta blockers on hold for GI bleed.
   - If this is an ongoing issue, will need to involve cardiology for
   possible pacemaker placement.
   #. EKG Changes: EKG showing new STD in anterior-lateral leads,
   troponins 0.02 with GFR ~50 up to 0.08, CK-MB normal. No CP/SOB.
   Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of an acute bleed.
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Amiodarone not on medication list, will confirm
   with pharmacy.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type II diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented with a brief loss of consciousness, right-sided paralysis, and aphasia, which was suspected to be a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck was negative for thrombus.

The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, with two maroon stools in the past 24 hours. The source of the bleeding is unclear, but a tagged red blood cell scan suggests that it may be coming from the lower gastrointestinal tract. The patient has also developed transaminitis and ascites on CT scan, which is concerning.

The patient has been treated with heparin for the TIA and has had a power PICC line placed. She has also had six units of packed red blood cells transfused, with a hemoglobin level of 31. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1, and she has been given vitamin K but not fresh frozen plasma.

The patient has also developed a knee effusion, which may be related to hemarthrosis due to her heparin therapy. She has been experiencing tachypnea and shortness of breath during blood transfusions, which has been treated with lasix.

The patient has had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was not on her medication list. She has also developed an elevated troponin level, which may be related to demand ischemia.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). Her emergency contact is her daughter, who is also her healthcare power of attorney.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require angiography or surgery.
2. Development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her heparin therapy.
3. Hemarthrosis or bleeding into the knee joint due to her heparin therapy.
4. Respiratory distress or failure due to fluid overload or chronic diastolic dysfunction.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias or heart block due to her atrial fibrillation or other underlying cardiac conditions.
6. Infection or sepsis due to her ascites or other underlying medical conditions.
7. Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to her underlying medical conditions or medications.
8. Neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack, due to her underlying medical conditions or medications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her bleeding, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory status. She should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding or infection, and her code status should be respected."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck, with R knee effusion
    #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --Continue neuro-recommended heparin gtt despite some BRBPR yesterday
   --Hold on restarting Coumadin until more definitive plan to address GI
   bleed is in place.
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   --If active bleeding or Hct drop will need to immediately stop Heparin
   gtt
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: repeat colonoscopy given repeated bleed yesterday --> could
   possibly start prep while in house, soon, as hasn't been on regular
   diet since admission
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   #. R knee effusion--Apparent effusion. Concern for hemarthrosis given
   on heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided
   paralysis. Yesterday u/s showing pre-patellar fluid collection
   yesterday, given heat packs and Tylenol yesterday with some
   improvement, still seen to have effusion this am though. Still no
   erythema and not tender to palpation.
   - Continue clinical exams and if seen to get larger or more painful,
   will need stop heparin and reconsider tap.
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider pushing for MRCP today, however now transaminases are
   improving on their own and Tbili is decreasing as well
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel --> AMA and [**Doctor First Name **]
   still pending. No evidence of HepB or C infection, has positive surface
   Ab so either vaccinated or infected but now immune.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, Ms. [**Known Lastname 9015**], is a 74-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), bradypnea, and hypotension. The patient had a recent initiation of coumadin, which was stopped due to a stroke within one week of starting the medication.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 141/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has been receiving heparin infusion for thromboprophylaxis, and her hematocrit (Hct) has been stable. However, she has had two melanotic stools in 24 hours, and her platelet count is 249,000/μL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28.3%
* Platelet count: 249,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 9.2 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 29 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and her recent imaging studies show a possible bleed in the lower gastrointestinal tract. She has also had a stroke, which has resolved, and is currently receiving heparin infusion for thromboprophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, and further bleeding may occur.
2. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving heparin infusion, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Stroke: The patient has had a recent stroke, and further strokes may occur if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is 28.3%, which may indicate anemia. Further bleeding may exacerbate this condition.
5. Infection: The patient's recent imaging studies show a possible bleed in the lower gastrointestinal tract, which may increase the risk of infection.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may require further monitoring and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin infusion for thromboprophylaxis, but monitor the patient's bleeding closely.
2. Consider restarting coumadin once the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is under control.
3. Monitor the patient's hematocrit and platelet count closely.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging studies if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further endoscopy or colonoscopy if necessary.
6. Consider further treatment for the patient's hypothyroidism, diabetes, and hypertension.
7. Monitor the patient's infection risk and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
8. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's stroke and potential underlying causes."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9015**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f atrial fibrillation with recent
   initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, s/p colonoscopy
   unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from, s/p TIA [**10-12**] with
   negative CT head/neck, with R knee effusion
    #. Stroke: S/p R-sided paralysis and aphasia, now symptomatically
   improved with negative CT head/neck for thrombus, negative ECHO for
   thrombus.  On heparin gtt.   Neuro following, consider restarting
   coumadin.  ECHO negative for thrombus, likely TIA since symptoms
   resolved
   --Continue neuro-recommended heparin gtt despite some BRBPR yesterday
   --Restart Coumadin today with Heparin bridge
   --Q2 hrs neuro checks
   --If active bleeding or Hct drop will need to immediately stop Heparin
   gtt
   #. GI bleed: On heparin for TIA, with 2 marroon stools in 24hrs.
   Unclear source as of now, the plan was to continue to follow Hcts and
   make sure she stabilizes, if brisk bleed would need to angiography.
   Hcts stable. Suspected site is from the lower GI tract, given initial
   brisk presentation and continued melena.  Tagged RBC scan suggests
   hepatic flexture vs duodenum.  She does have transaminitis with ascites
   on CT, so it
s concerning that she has RUQ bleed and
   transaminitis/ascites.  S/p 6 units pRBC with Hct 16->31, now stable
   Hct and 2  melanotic stools.  INR now 1.1, given Vit K but no FFP.
   Lactate normalized.
   - Hct q8hr
   - To angio if brisk bleeding
   - GI recs: repeat colonoscopy given chronic anemia --> could possibly
   start prep while in house, soon, as hasn't been on regular diet since
   admission
   - Access 2 large bore PIVs  and  power PICC
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse for HCT <21 or active bleeding
   - surgery following
   - continue IV PPI
   - Holding antihypertensives, ASA, and warfarin
   #. R knee effusion--Apparent effusion. Concern for hemarthrosis given
   on heparin gtt for TIA vs unknown trauma in setting of R sided
   paralysis. Yesterday u/s showing pre-patellar fluid collection
   yesterday, given heat packs and Tylenol yesterday with some
   improvement, still seen to have effusion this am though. Still no
   erythema and not tender to palpation.
   - Continue clinical exams and if seen to get larger or more painful,
   will need stop heparin and reconsider tap.
   # Elevated transaminases and Tbili: With CBD dilatation on CT scan to
   15mm. ERCP fellow is on board and has recommended stabilizing the pt
   from a GIB perspective and then consider MRCP to assess whether a mass
   at the ampulla could be causing the bleed. This was before the possible
   CVA this am, and this will need to be further investigated once pt more
   stable.
   --Consider pushing for MRCP today, however now transaminases are
   improving on their own and Tbili is decreasing as well
   --F/u hepatitis panels and autoimmune hepatitis panel --> AMA and [**Doctor First Name **]
   still pending. No evidence of HepB or C infection, has positive surface
   Ab so either vaccinated or infected but now immune.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was recently initiated on coumadin and presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and a transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was found to have a stroke, which has resolved symptomatically. She is currently receiving heparin infusions and is being monitored closely for bleeding.

The patient's recent lab results show:

* Hct: 27.7%
* WBC: 9.2
* Platelets: 249
* Creatinine: 0.7
* Glucose: 92
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* LDH: 371 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her recent stroke and the use of heparin infusions. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is essential.
* Infection: The patient's recent TIA and stroke increase her risk for infection. Close monitoring of her temperature and white blood cell count is essential.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if her thyroid medication is not adjusted properly.
* Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen if her blood sugar levels are not controlled properly.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may worsen if her bleeding is not controlled properly.
* Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen if her cardiac medications are not adjusted properly.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may drop further due to her recent stroke and the use of heparin infusions.
* Kidney damage: The patient's kidney function may worsen if her blood pressure is not controlled properly.

Recommendations:

* Continue close monitoring of the patient's bleeding, infection, and electrolyte levels.
* Adjust the patient's thyroid medication and diabetes medications as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's heart failure and adjust her cardiac medications as necessary.
* Consider restarting coumadin once the patient's bleeding has stabilized.
* Consider performing an MRCP to assess the patient's pancreaticobiliary tree and rule out any potential causes of her bleeding.
* Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her blood pressure as necessary.
* Consider performing a tagged RBC scan to assess the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, is a high-risk surgical patient with a history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with bleeding from the rectum, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and a right knee effusion. She was recently initiated on coumadin and had a trans-arterial embolization (TAE) procedure. The patient's current condition is stable, with no active bleeding or melena in the past 24 hours. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable, and she is scheduled for a colonoscopy today. The patient is receiving heparin infusions, which will be bridged to coumadin once the colonoscopy is completed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to her history of GIB and the use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), due to her history of atrial fibrillation and the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a central venous catheter (PICC line) and the use of antibiotics.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and requires ongoing treatment with levothyroxine.
5. Diabetes: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and requires ongoing treatment with insulin and oral medications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Right knee effusion: The patient has a right knee effusion and is at risk for further complications, such as infection or bleeding.
8. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal LFTs, which may indicate liver disease or damage.
9. Positive blood culture: The patient has a positive blood culture, which may indicate sepsis or infection.
10. Unknown hepatitis status: The patient's hepatitis status is unknown, which may pose a risk for transmission of hepatitis to healthcare workers.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Continue heparin infusions to prevent thromboembolic events.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a PMH of atrial fibrillation, recent initiation of coumadin, who presented with BRBPR, GIB, and s/p colonoscopy unable to assess where the bleeding was coming from. She has a history of TIA, R knee effusion, and is currently on heparin gtt (held for colonoscopy). She is being bridged to coumadin and is being monitored for active bleeding or Hct drop.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no melena in 24 hours and stable Hct. She is scheduled for a colonoscopy today and will have Hct q8hr. She has a R knee effusion, which is improving with heat packs and Tylenol.

The patient has abnormal LFTs, which are improving, and has a CBD dilatation on CT scan to 15mm. She is being considered for ERCP to assess whether a mass at the ampulla could be causing the bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Active bleeding: The patient's Hct is stable, but there is a risk of active bleeding, which could lead to further decline in Hct and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient is on heparin gtt, which carries a risk of developing HIT, a life-threatening condition characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her atrial fibrillation and recent initiation of coumadin.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk of developing PE due to her atrial fibrillation and recent initiation of coumadin.
5. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of GIB, which could recur, leading to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with bleeding from the rectum (BRBPR), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and a right knee effusion. She was admitted to the ICU and received heparin therapy, which was held for a colonoscopy. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been stable, and she has not had any further melena. She has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, diabetes type II, and a possible autoimmune hepatitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 167/73 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. Her neurological examination is normal, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient has undergone several laboratory tests, including complete blood counts, liver function tests, and coagulation studies. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Her coagulation studies show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), but a normal international normalized ratio (INR).

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from the rectum and gastrointestinal tract, and she is still receiving heparin therapy. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially if her Hct levels drop or if she has an active bleeding episode.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has a prolonged PT and aPTT, which may indicate a risk of thrombosis. However, her INR is normal, which suggests that her coagulation profile is not significantly abnormal.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction. This could be caused by her autoimmune hepatitis or another underlying condition.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may increase her risk of developing an infection. She also has a prolonged hospital stay, which may increase her risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving heparin therapy, which may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for bleeding, thrombosis, hepatic dysfunction, infection, and cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."
