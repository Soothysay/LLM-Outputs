   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac output,
   however EKG shows stable LBBB, with negative Scarbosa criteria.
   Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfusion goal of HCT>27 given h/o CAD
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
 negative thus far
   - wean off propofol in preparation for SBT
   - wean off neosynephrine
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - Touch base with surgery team
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - check HCT Q8H, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Pt seemed to tolerate PEEP of 0 which seemed to suggest acute
   dCHF not a significant factor on respiratory status.
   - decrease FiO2 now, decrease sedation and change over to PSV as
   tolerated
   - wean off propofol
   - SBT today with goal for extubation
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Pt with significant volume overload
   on CXR after 3L LR and 2 units PRBCs.
   -Since no significant affect on respiratory status, will hold off on
   diuresis for now given weaning neo today
   -Consider diuresis tonight or tomorrow if more stable and will discuss
   with surgery first
   .
   # PAF: Currently sinus with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. Has not been
   anticoagulated in past for unclear reasons, ? [**1-10**] GIB.
   - amio gtt at 0.5mg/hr since not taking POs
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma, who was transferred to the ICU for post-operative hypotension after undergoing an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy. She has been diagnosed with hypotension, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to intraoperative blood loss, sedation, and possible sepsis or intraoperative infection. If not managed promptly, it may lead to organ hypoperfusion, shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to blood loss during surgery and known malignancy. If not managed, it may lead to further hypovolemia, decreased oxygen delivery, and increased risk of organ failure.
3. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased pulmonary congestion, decreased cardiac output, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased respiratory distress, decreased oxygenation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's potential sepsis may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased risk of organ failure, septic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Intraoperative Infection/Perforation: The patient's potential intraoperative infection or perforation may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased risk of sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure prompt management and prevention of complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac
   output.  Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfuse 2 units [**Hospital Unit Name **] now, repeat post-transfusion HCT
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
   - if remains hypotensive after fluid repletion and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] change
   propofol to fentanyl/versed to decrease hypotension but would ideally
   want to extubate in the morning so would not want long acting sedation
   - continue neo, titrate to MAP>65
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - consider TTE in am
   - empiric unasyn for now for possible infection
   - trend CvO2 sat, lactate
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - transfuse 2 units [**First Name3 (LF) **] now,
   - check HCT q8, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Currently on SIMV Vt 500 RR 12, FiO2 80% with ABG 7.39/49/220

   tolerated
   - SBT in am with goal for extubation
   .
   # PAF: Currently sinus with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. Has not been
   anticoagulated in past for unclear reasons, ? [**1-10**] GIB.
   - amio gtt at 0.5mg/hr since not taking POs
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA. She was transferred to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/40 mmHg. Her central venous oxygen saturation is 74-74%. She has anemia, likely due to blood loss from surgery and known malignancy. She also has hypothyroidism and is receiving levothyroxine.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to intraoperative blood loss and sedation. She is being treated with fluid repletion and dobutamine weaning to avoid increased risk of arrhythmia. She will be empirically treated for possible sepsis.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss from surgery and known malignancy. She is being transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and will be monitored for HCT levels.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to hemodynamic instability, but is being weaned off sedation and will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial in the morning.
4. PAF: The patient has a sinus rhythm with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. She has not been anticoagulated in the past for unclear reasons, and may be at risk for GIB.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism will be continued with levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and respiratory failure may be due to sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. GIB: The patient's PAF and lack of anticoagulation may increase her risk of GIB, which could lead to bleeding and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, which could increase her risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other complications.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and cardiac instability may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and cardiac failure.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's anemia and hypotension may increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.6°C
* Heart rate: 75 bpm
* Blood pressure: 117/40 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 74%

The patient has a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon adenoCA. She is currently receiving amiodarone, propofol, and pantoprazole infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 126 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mEq/L
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 165 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation, with consideration of intraop myocardial ischemia, sepsis, or intraop infection/perforation.
* Anemia: likely related to blood loss from surgery and known malignancy, with consideration of hemodilution due to IV fluid administration.
* Respiratory failure: patient remains intubated due to hemodynamic instability, with plans to decrease FiO2 and sedation, and change to PSV as tolerated.
* PAF: patient has a sinus rhythm with LBBB on PO amio, with consideration of anticoagulation due to unclear reasons.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's history of surgery and potential intraop infection, sepsis is a possible complication.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is currently unstable, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: the patient's history of CAD and dCHF, combined with her current hypotension and potential intraop myocardial ischemia, increases her risk of cardiac complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient's history of colon adenoCA and potential intraop bleeding increases her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: the patient's history of hypertension and potential intraop kidney damage increases her risk of renal failure.
* Electrolyte imbalance: the patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to electrolyte imbalance if not addressed.
* Infection: the patient's history of surgery and potential intraop infection increases her risk of infection.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual with a complex medical history and current instability. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-operative partial bowel resection patient who was extubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. The patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath, and an ECG was performed, but the results are inconclusive for ischemia due to a left bundle branch block.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 393 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.06 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, which may indicate hypoxemia, especially given the patient's respiratory compromise.
2. Heart failure: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and the ECG shows a left bundle branch block, which may indicate cardiac injury or heart failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL, which is below the normal range, and may indicate anemia.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function test results are not available, but the patient has a history of cancer, which may increase the risk of hypothyroidism.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of VAP.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, but the risk of DVT is still present.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the surgical procedure and the use of corticosteroids.
8. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and a prolonged prothrombin time, which may indicate infection.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent a partial bowel resection for colon adenocarcinoma. She was transferred to the ICU for post-operative hypotension. She has a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon cancer. The patient is currently extubated and receiving oxygen therapy with a face mask at 70% FiO2. She has developed worsened atelectasis and left-sided effusion on CXR. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her lab results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels. She is receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's development of worsened atelectasis and left-sided effusion on CXR increases her risk of pneumonia.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF and acute diastolic heart failure, along with her current elevated blood pressure, increases her risk of further heart failure exacerbation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to lose blood or if her blood loss is not adequately replaced.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output increase her risk of acute kidney injury progression.
5. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen or convert to ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening atelectasis and left-sided effusion may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased albumin levels increase her risk of sepsis.
8. Cancer Recurrence: The patient's history of colon cancer and her current anemia and elevated troponin levels may indicate cancer recurrence or metastasis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies.
2. Administer antibiotics for possible pneumonia and continue to monitor for signs of infection.
3. Optimize the patient's heart failure management, including diuresis and vasopressor therapy as needed.
4. Consider transfusing blood products to address the patient's anemia.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy to prevent further blood loss.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adjusting her anticoagulation therapy or administering cardioversion if necessary.
8. Consider performing a bronchoscopy or other imaging studies to evaluate the patient's respiratory status.
9. Consider performing a bone marrow biopsy or other diagnostic tests to evaluate the patient's anemia and cancer status.
10. Consider involving a palliative care team to address the patient's symptoms and quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent a partial bowel resection for colon adenocarcinoma. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension. She was extubated but is still receiving supplemental oxygen via face mask at 70% FiO2. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg. She has a history of chronic conditions, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is still receiving supplemental oxygen and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may increase her risk of hypoxemia.
2. HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient's chest x-ray shows worsened atelectasis and left-sided effusion, which may indicate a high risk of HAP.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently experiencing hypotension, which may worsen her heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of blood loss and is at risk of developing anemia.
5. AFib (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient is currently receiving amiodarone to control her AFib, but this medication may have side effects.
6. Thyroid Dysfunction: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and may require further thyroid function tests to monitor her thyroid status.
7. Cancer: The patient has a history of colon adenocarcinoma and may require further treatment or monitoring for recurrence.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation levels.
2. Consider starting antibiotics to treat potential HAP.
3. Monitor the patient's volume status and diurese prn to prevent heart failure.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's AFib and adjust her medication as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust her medication as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cancer and consider further treatment or monitoring for recurrence."
