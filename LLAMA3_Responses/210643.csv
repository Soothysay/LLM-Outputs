   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin (Day #2) per ID recs (concern for atypical
   infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Will talk with BMT regarding the risks/benefits of holding chemo
   while evaluating pulmonary process, as fever/symptoms may be secondary
   to the leukemia itself vs. pulmonary infection.
   - Will touch base with BMT regarding transfusion thresholds
   (?hematocrit>25, plts>20). Current hct =  21.7, plt = 13.
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Tmax of 103.6 over yesterday.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days.
   -          Consider U/S RUQ to eval for infiltrative process, given
   pt
s dx of leukemia.
   -          Will touch base with BMT.
   .
   # HIV: Continue HAART therapy.
   - stable on atripla treatment
   .
   # HTN: HR elevated over most of yesterday (range 100-130s), BP in
   90s-110s. Pt also has had decreased urine output.
   -          Will try a fluid challenge to see if  UOP and HR will
   respond favorably.
   -          For now, will continue home Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Will consider
   increasing if HR still not effectively controlled after fluid
   challenge.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and being treated for possible AML M6 vs infectious process. He was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea and hypoxia. His condition has been unstable, with fever spikes, increasing tachypnea, and episodes of incontinence. He has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, but his condition remains unchanged. His laboratory results show pancytopenia, elevated LFTs, and hyperlipidemia. He is on HAART therapy and has a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and neutropenia may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's chest CT shows diffuse bilateral micronodular opacities, which could be indicative of an atypical infection, such as pulmonary tularemia.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest CT could also be indicative of pneumonia, which could be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
5. Leukemia: The patient's pancytopenia and bone marrow biopsy results suggest a diagnosis of AML M6, which could be progressing and worsening his condition.
6. Infections: The patient's neutropenia and fever make him susceptible to infections, which could be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
7. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's pancytopenia, elevated LFTs, and hyperlipidemia could indicate organ dysfunction, which could lead to organ failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hypoxia. They have been experiencing increasing tachypnea, fever spikes, and episodes of incontinence. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 103.6°F, heart rate of 129 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/61 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's chest X-ray and CTA chest show diffuse bilateral micronodular opacities, suggestive of atypical infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever spikes, tachypnea, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis. This could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray and CTA chest show diffuse bilateral micronodular opacities, which could be indicative of pneumonia. This could lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia could be indicative of ARDS, which could lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia could be indicative of renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and require dialysis.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's episodes of incontinence could be indicative of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction.
7. Central Nervous System (CNS) Complications: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia could be indicative of CNS complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

Based on the patient's unstable vital signs and laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide aggressive treatment to prevent further complications."

   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin per ID recs (concern for atypical infection like
   pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP treatment
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 3905**] anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - may need chemo defer to BMT
   - will transfuse to keep hematocrit>25, plts>20
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .

   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin per ID recs (concern for atypical infection like
   pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP treatment
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 3905**] anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - may need chemo defer to BMT
   - will transfuse to keep hematocrit>25, plts>20
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and on the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process. The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and hypoxia.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with increasing tachypnea (RR 40s) and fever spikes. He has also experienced episodes of incontinence. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.6°F, heart rate of 129 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/61 mmHg.

The patient has a diagnosis of atypical infection, with diffuse bilateral micronodular opacities on chest CT, and is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medication. He is also receiving supplemental oxygen and has been started on doxycycline for possible atypical infection.

The patient has pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 1.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 16 K/uL. He is also neutropenic and has a fever of 103.6°F.

The patient's medical history is significant for HIV, and he is currently on HAART therapy. He also has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and neutropenia make him susceptible to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's atypical infection may progress to pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
4. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient's atypical infection may lead to complications such as abscesses, empyemas, or bronchitis.
6. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's elevated LDH and low haptoglobin suggest hemolytic anemia, which may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Bone marrow failure: The patient's bone marrow biopsy suggests AML M6, which may lead to bone marrow failure and increased risk of bleeding and infection.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple medical complications, including atypical infection, pancytopenia, and neutropenic fever. He requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Variable respiratory rates and oxygenation through the past 24 hours.
   During my exam, I reduced his supplemental O2 to 3L via nasal cannula.
   O2 sats holding at 95-96%. With coaching, respiratory rate a bit
   slower, although he remains tachypneic. Probably represents some
   anxiety and some stimulation of pulmonary receptors from underlying
   pneumonia, which dose appear to have progressed slightly on CT scan. No
   evidence of pulmonary embolism. Cultures remain negative thus far.
   Fevers persist.
   Hct near transfusion threshold. Given variable oxygenation, I would
   favor transfusion for increased oxygen carrying capacity.
   Start H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and pneumoboots for DVT
   prophylaxis.
   Patient appears somewhat volume depleted. Give additional IV fluids via
   boluses.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory distress

   3) Pancytopenia
   4) AML
   Variable respiratory rates and oxygenation through the past 24 hours.
   During my exam, I reduced his supplemental O2 to 3L via nasal cannula.
   O2 sats holding at 95-96%. With coaching, respiratory rate a bit
   slower, although he remains tachypneic. Probably represents some
   anxiety and some stimulation of pulmonary receptors from underlying
   pneumonia, which dose appear to have progressed slightly on CT scan. No
   evidence of pulmonary embolism. Cultures remain negative thus far.
   Fevers persist.
   Hct near transfusion threshold. Given variable oxygenation, I would
   favor transfusion for increased oxygen carrying capacity.
   Start H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and pneumoboots for DVT
   prophylaxis.
   Patient appears somewhat volume depleted. Give additional IV fluids via
   boluses.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has deteriorated overnight with increased supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and a sudden change in respiratory rate.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 103.6°C (fever)
* Heart rate: 105 bpm (tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 104/65 mmHg (hypotension)
* Respiratory rate: 42 breaths per minute (tachypnea)
* Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, thin, and anxious
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and no rub
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, and bilateral crackles
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Extremities: No cyanosis or clubbing
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and oriented to person, place, and time

Laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL (anemia)
* White blood cell count: 1.8 K/uL (leukopenia)
* Platelet count: 16 K/uL (thrombocytopenia)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL (elevated)
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL (elevated)
* Electrolytes: Abnormal (potassium 4.0 mEq/L, sodium 138 mEq/L, and chloride 21.7%)

Imaging studies show:

* CTA: No pulmonary embolism
* Slight progression of ground glass opacities on CT scan

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is tachypneic, and oxygen saturation is holding at 95-96% despite increased supplemental oxygen.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral crackles, and cultures remain negative.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count are all low.
4. AML: The patient has a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: Reduce supplemental oxygen to 3L via nasal cannula.
2. Fluid management: Give additional IV fluids via boluses to address volume depletion.
3. Blood transfusion: Transfuse blood to increase oxygen carrying capacity.
4. Prophylaxis: Start H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
5. Nutrition: Provide regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient is at risk for further complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate the presence of sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and low white blood cell count make them susceptible to infection.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver and kidney function may deteriorate, leading to organ dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hypoxia, febrile neutropenia
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday afternoon, pt decided to proceed with Chemo. He was amenable
   to intubation if necessary. Cytarabine was initiated last night.
   Pt required transfusion this a.m. of 1u PRBC (hct 20) and 2 bags plt
   (plt 9).
   Pt continued to spike fevers over yesterday.
   On exam this a.m., pt continued to be tachypneic with RR in 40s. Mental
   status less clear, possibly encephalopathic. Pt was unable to verbalize
   where he was and name, possibly [**3-1**] tachypnea.
   [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, pt was not taking PO meds (would hold meds in mouth without
   swallowing.)

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.
   .
   # Code: Full. Family meeting today to discuss possible plan for
   intubation today with patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M6, currently admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, hypoxia, and febrile neutropenia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tachypnea (RR 34-40 breaths/min)
* Tachycardia (HR 129 bpm)
* Hypoxia (SpO2 100%)
* Fever (103.3°C)
* Blood pressure (118/79 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukopenia (WBC 1.8 K/uL)
* Thrombocytopenia (plt 9 K/uL)
* Anemia (Hct 20%)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
* Hyperglycemia (glucose 121 mg/dL)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)

The patient's medications include:

* Cytarabine (initiated last night)
* Caspofungin (switched to Microfungin due to liver function test abnormalities)
* Cefepime (discontinued and replaced with Meropenem)
* Doxycycline (high-dose)
* Vanc (added to cover gram-positive bacteria)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue supplemental oxygen
* Intubate if work of breathing continues to increase
* Continue high-dose Doxycycline
* Start Meropenem and Vanc
* Change Caspofungin to Microfungin
* Hold off on PCP prophylaxis
* Consider adding lactulose for encephalopathy
* Monitor liver function tests and adjust medications as necessary
* Continue HIV medications (Atripla)
* Monitor and manage blood pressure
* Consider NG tube for feeding due to neutropenic diet and mucositis
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to tachypnea and hypoxia
* Sepsis due to febrile neutropenia
* Liver failure due to elevated liver enzymes
* Renal failure due to hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalance
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to mucositis and neutropenic diet
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to tachycardia and electrolyte imbalance
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Increased risk of infection due to neutropenia and immunosuppression

The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting has been scheduled to discuss possible intubation today."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a febrile neutropenic individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including caspofungin and cefipime, and has been managed with various ICU medications, including furosemide and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 103.3°F (39.6°C) at 12:00 AM, with a current temperature of 100.3°F (37.9°C)
* Heart rate: 129 bpm (105-140 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/79 mmHg (87-134/97 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute (29-48 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula and face tent

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 1.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 16
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 30 mmHg
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is significant for sinus tachycardia and a blood pressure of 118/79 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Septic shock due to febrile neutropenia
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxia
* Cardiovascular instability due to sinus tachycardia and hypotension
* Renal failure due to decreased perfusion and potential antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity
* Infection-related complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Hemodynamic instability due to fluid overload and potential cardiac compromise

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications and adjust management accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin (Day #2) per ID recs (concern for atypical
   infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Will talk with BMT regarding the risks/benefits of holding chemo
   while evaluating pulmonary process, as fever/symptoms may be secondary
   to the leukemia itself vs. pulmonary infection.
   - Will touch base with BMT regarding transfusion thresholds
   (?hematocrit>25, plts>20). Current hct =  21.7, plt = 13.
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Tmax of 103.6 over yesterday.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days.
   -          Consider U/S RUQ to eval for infiltrative process, given
   pt
s dx of leukemia.
   -          Will touch base with BMT.
   .
   # HIV: Continue HAART therapy.
   - stable on atripla treatment
   .
   # HTN: HR elevated over most of yesterday (range 100-130s), BP in
   90s-110s. Pt also has had decreased urine output.
   -          Will try a fluid challenge to see if  UOP and HR will
   respond favorably.
   -          For now, will continue home Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Will consider
   increasing if HR still not effectively controlled after fluid
   challenge.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cont zetia
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, replete as necessary
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. Will add H2 blocker today.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: the patient became tachypneic on a.m. of admission, but
   maintained his sats well. His repeat ABG showed a primary respiratory
   alkalosis with a slight increase in his A-a gradient. The patient felt
   that he was becoming very anxious and given that he responded to ativan
   very well and his CXR is unchanged from prior, his decrease in PO2 may
   very well have been from hyperventilation and increased dead space
   ventilation. CTA ruled out PE, but does support an atypical infectious
   process in his lungs. Pt continues to be tachypneic, despite
   anti-anxiety medication and reassurance, currently requiring 6LNC.
   - continue supplemental O2
   - Continue Doxycyclin (Day #2) per ID recs (concern for atypical
   infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin
   - Do not restart PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypoxia: evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   atypical infection. ID recommends restarting doxycyclin.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Continue cefepime, caspofungin, Doxycyclin
   .
   # Pancytopenia: bone marrow biopsy is concerning for AML M6 type. His
   very extensive infectious disease workup has so far been negative,
   including a negative PCR for ParvoB19. He appears to be hemolyzing
   given elevated LDH and low haptoglobin, although this is likely
   compounded by myelodysplasia.
   - further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Will talk with BMT regarding the risks/benefits of holding chemo
   while evaluating pulmonary process, as fever/symptoms may be secondary
   to the leukemia itself vs. pulmonary infection.
   - Will touch base with BMT regarding transfusion thresholds
   (?hematocrit>25, plts>20). Current hct =  21.7, plt = 13.
   - f/u ID recs, restarted doxycycline as above
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Tmax of 103.6 over yesterday.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days.
   -          Consider U/S RUQ to eval for infiltrative process, given
   pt
s dx of leukemia.
   -          Will touch base with BMT.
   .
   # HIV: Continue HAART therapy.
   - stable on atripla treatment
   .
   # HTN: HR elevated over most of yesterday (range 100-130s), BP in
   90s-110s. Pt also has had decreased urine output.
   -          Will try a fluid challenge to see if  UOP and HR will
   respond favorably.
   -          For now, will continue home Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Will consider
   increasing if HR still not effectively controlled after fluid
   challenge.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Cont zetia
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, replete as necessary
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. Will add H2 blocker today.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HIV, transferred to the ICU for tachypnea and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with possible AML M6 vs. infectious process and is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient has developed pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and elevated liver function tests. He is also experiencing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and decreased urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may be due to a pulmonary infection, which could progress to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and elevated liver function tests suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not recognized and treated early.
3. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's elevated LDH and low haptoglobin suggest the possibility of hemolytic anemia, which could be caused by his underlying leukemia or an infectious process.
4. Leukemia Progression: The patient's pancytopenia and bone marrow biopsy findings suggest that his leukemia may be progressing, which could lead to worsening anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine suggest the possibility of renal dysfunction, which could be caused by his underlying leukemia or an infectious process.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure, particularly if his underlying leukemia is progressing.
7. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's atypical infectious process and negative PCR for ParvoB19 suggest the possibility of other infections, such as pulmonary tularemia, which could lead to complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or organ dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of pneumonia, hypoxemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and pancytopenia. The patient is receiving treatment for AML, and blood transfusions have been administered for anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 103.3°F (39.6°C)
* Heart rate: 142 bpm (normal range: 119-142 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/57 mmHg (normal range: 95-135/65-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 42 breaths per minute (normal range: 29-48 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98% (normal range: 95-100%)
* CVP: 5 mmHg (normal range: 2-8 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 1.8 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 16 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Lactic acid: 2.9 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)
* LDH: 3936 IU/L (normal range: 100-400 IU/L)

The patient's imaging studies reveal:

* RUQ ultrasound: fatty infiltration of the liver
* CXR: increased alveolar nodular opacities bilaterally

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Pneumonia
* Hypoxemia
* Respiratory distress
* AML
* Pancytopenia
* Coagulopathy
* CXR shows progression of bilateral alveolar opacities
* Antibiotics continue, with modifications per ID recommendations given rising LFT's and persistent pancytopenia
* Chemo started for AML
* Blood counts remain low, and transfusions have been administered
* Lactic acid is rising, which may relate to infection or progressive liver failure
* Patient is less alert, with concern for hepatic encephalopathy
* Begin lactulose if possible, as NG tube or rectal administration is risky due to thrombocytopenia and neutropenia
* Unable to eat, and TPN may be considered
* ICU care includes prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia and AML
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxemia and pneumonia
* Liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy due to fatty infiltration and rising LFT's
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Infection or sepsis due to indwelling lines and catheters
* Malnutrition or starvation due to inability to eat and potential need for TPN
* Cardiac complications due to hypotension and hypoxemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxia, dyspnea, and febrile neutropenia. They were intubated yesterday afternoon and required multiple blood product transfusions, including 3u pRBCs, 3u FFP, and 2 bags of platelets.

The patient's condition has continued to deteriorate, with worsening renal function, respiratory function, and blood pressure. They have required increasing amounts of oxygen support, with FiO2 increasing to 60%. The patient's arterial line was inserted at 10:00 PM, and they are receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and vasopressors.

Laboratory results indicate worsening renal function, with creatinine increasing to 2.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) rising to 45 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 1.5 K/uL, and their platelet count is 9. They have a severe anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 41 mmHg, and pO2 of 51 mmHg. They have a significant oxygen requirement, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 85.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile neutropenia and worsening renal function suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory function and ABG results are concerning for ARDS.
3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and increasing creatinine levels suggest the possibility of renal failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and requirement for multiple blood product transfusions increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and worsening respiratory function increase the risk of pneumonia.
7. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's worsening renal function, respiratory function, and cardiovascular instability suggest the possibility of sepsis-related organ dysfunction.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular status. Further evaluation and management should focus on addressing the underlying causes of the patient's deterioration and preventing potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.
   .
   # Code: Full. Family meeting today to discuss possible plan for
   intubation today with patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3904**] is a 57 year old male with history of HIV since [**2099**] on
   the BMT service for possible AML M6 vs infectious process, now
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] s/p bronchoscopy for tachypnea.
   .
   # Tachypnea: pt continues to be tachypneic. Likely related to his
   underlying malignancy vs. pulmonary infiltrative process. Requiring
   increased O2 daily. Pt expressed desire to be intubated if necessary.
   - continue supplemental O2. [**Month (only) 60**] intubate later today if work of
   breathing continues to increase.
   - Continue high-dose Doxycyclin (Day #3) per ID recs (concern for
   atypical infection like pulmonary tularemia)
   - Per ID recs, will d/c Cefepime and start Meropenem (Day #5) for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - Will add Vanc per ID recs to cover gram +
   - Will change Caspofungin to Microfungin per ID recs to decrease
   effects on LFTs
   - Holding off on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  (negative for PCP on BAL)
   - RTC anxiolytics
   - ID following
   .
   # AML M6 c/b Pancytopenia: likely poor prognosis per BMT. Pt is a poor
   candidate for BMT with his HIV status. Additionally, current chemo
   regimen available to pt is 2^nd line, with significant side effects. In
   family mtg, pt wanted to proceed with chemo.
   - Pending further analysis of bone marrow findings are pending
   - Pt started a dose of chemo with Cytarabine last night. Will touch
   base with BMT regarding additional dosing.
   - BMT following
   - Given mental status change and encephalopathy, will consider adding
   Lactulose (?non- PO form available).
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: pt continues to be afebrile with spikes to 103.
   -          Continue treatment as above, Tylenol PRN.
   .
   #Elevated LFTs: pt has had up-trending LFTS over past few days. LDH
   spiked to [**Numeric Identifier 3932**] this a.m. Can be related to recent initiation of chemo
   last night.
   -          RUQ u/s obtained yesterday to eval for obstructive process
   given leukemia. Results negative for masses/ infiltrative process.
   -          BMT following. Will touch base regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   -          Will check q6 tumor lysis labs.
   .
   # HIV: Stable on HAART therapy.
   - Continue Atripla. Will touch base with ID regarding adjustment of
   medications given transaminitis.
   .
   # BP control: currently stable. Continue home lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   # Hyperlipidemia: Zetia d/c
ed given elevated LFTs.
   .
   # FEN: neutropenic diet, but pt not taking much PO. Consider NGT for
   feeding (?mucositis given leukemia? Will check with BMT.) replete lytes
   as necessary.
   .
   # PPX: venodynes. H2 blocker IV.
   .
   # Lines: PIV, RSC CVL
   .
   # Dispo: Continue ICU monitoring as HR and respiratory status still
   unstable.
   .
   # Code: Full. Family meeting today to discuss possible plan for
   intubation today with patient.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxia
* Dyspnea
* Febrile neutropenia
* Pancytopenia (likely poor prognosis)
* Elevated LFTs (possibly related to recent initiation of chemotherapy)
* Hyperlipidemia (Zetia discontinued due to elevated LFTs)
* HIV (stable on HAART therapy)

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Caspofungin
* Cefipime
* Doxycycline
* Meropenem
