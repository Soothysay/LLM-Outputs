   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed who presents today from outpatient
   appointment with ARF and hct of 17.5 likely due to lower GI bleed.  Is
   moderately hypotensive from baseline in 120s to 80s-100s systolics.
   Oxygenating well on room air.
   # Hypotension: hypotension likely from hypovolemia, although could be
   multifactorial with beta blockage in the setting of renal failure.  Has
   GI bleed with melena and hct of 17.5, although her baseline is around
   22.  Also had a recent fall with bruising on her back and may have lost
   some blood into hematomas.  Has had nausea, vomiting and poor PO
   intake.  Grossly is extravascularly fluid overload with severe LE
   edema.  Difficult to fluid resucitate due to hx of heart failure.
   - transfuse 2 units PRBCs
   - hct q6hrs
   - goal Hct >23
   - hold BB and diuretics for now
   - consider CVL if MAPs consistently <60
   - consider diuresis to see if poor forward flow is the cause of her
   hypotension
   - echo in AM assess for function
   # GI bleed: likely due to known telangectasias seen on prior
   colonoscopy.  Had hemeoccult negative gastric lavage and negative upper
   endoscopy in [**Month (only) 1088**] so will not scope tonight.
   - continue to support Hct for >23
   - protonix 40 mg q12hrs
   - 3 PIVs
   - f/u GI recs
   - if briskly bleeding consider RBC scan and IR angiography
   - consider scope
   # Anemia: as above, likely from GI losses and possible small loses into
   hematomas.
   - transfuse for Hct <23
   - hold Fe for now as NPO
   # Ulcerative colitis: does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no cramping abdominal pain.
   - hold mesalamine for now as is strickly NPO
   - f/u GI recs
   - no indication for steroids or immunesuppressants now
   # Diastolic CHF: has severe diastolic CHF and history of needing
   midodrine and aggressive diuresis.  On exam and based on history seems
   to be more likely intravascularly depleted in the setting of total body
   overload.  Due to her hypotension are limited in our ability to
   diurese.
   - hold diuretics for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   - mostly right sided, so will follow LFTs
   - consider CVL and pressors/diuresis if needed
   # ARF: acute on chronic renal failure, likely in the setting of
   worsening heart failure and poor forward flow.  Seen in outpatient
   renal today, had renal US that was normal.  Electrolytes stable, no
   evidence of uremia on exam.
   - check urine lytes, osms, eos
   - follow urine output
   - trend creatinine
   # Afib: stable, slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated secondary
   to GI bleeding
   - hold BB in setting of hypotension
   # S/p Fall: mechanical, tripped on nightgown.  Has hematoma and warmth
   on L leg knee.  Doesn't appear infected, no white count, and per
   patient is decreasing in size.
   - continue to monitor exams
   # Edema: stable per patient but severe LE edema limiting walking.  Are

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed. She was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and anemia, likely due to lower GI bleed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.8°C (96.4°F) and 35.4°C (95.8°F) over the past 24 hours
* Heart rate: 109 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/58 mmHg, with a baseline of 120s-100s systolic
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 94%

The patient has a history of severe diastolic CHF and is moderately hypotensive from baseline. She has grossly extravascular fluid overload with severe LE edema, making it difficult to fluid resuscitate. She is also at risk for hypovolemia, which may be contributing to her hypotension.

The patient has a GI bleed with melena and a hematocrit of 17.5, which is likely due to known telangectasias seen on prior colonoscopy. She is being transfused with PRBCs to maintain a hematocrit of >23%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 6.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 21.7%
* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 190 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 115 mg/dL
* Glucose: 101 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Transfusing 2 units of PRBCs
* Holding beta blockers and diuretics for now
* Considering CVL if MAPs consistently <60
* Considering diuresis to see if poor forward flow is the cause of her hypotension
* Echo in the morning to assess for cardiac function

The patient's GI bleed is likely due to known telangectasias seen on prior colonoscopy. She has a history of ulcerative colitis, but it does not appear to be in a flare.

The patient's anemia is likely due to GI losses and possible small losses into hematomas.

The patient's ARF is acute on chronic renal failure, likely in the setting of worsening heart failure and poor forward flow. She has been seen in outpatient renal and had a normal renal US. Electrolytes are stable, and there is no evidence of uremia on exam.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is stable, with a slow ventricular response. She is not anticoagulated secondary to GI bleeding.

The patient has a history of falls and has a hematoma and warmth on her left leg knee. She does not appear to have an infection, and the hematoma is decreasing in size.

The patient has severe LE edema, which is limiting her walking. She is holding diuresis as written above.

The patient is NPO, and her pain control is being managed with morphine IV PRN.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further GI bleeding
* Worsening anemia
* Development of uremia
* Infection of the hematoma
* Progressive heart failure
* Respiratory compromise due to severe LE edema
* Development of electrolyte imbalances
* Further falls and injury"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed, who presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and hypotension. She has a large left lower extremity (LLE) hematoma, severe LE edema, and is moderately hypotensive. The patient has a history of telangectasias seen on prior colonoscopy, and the GI bleed is likely due to these telangectasias. She is being treated with dopamine, morphine, and protonix.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hypovolemic Shock:** The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and organ dysfunction if not addressed promptly.
2. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and if not managed properly, can lead to further blood loss, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. **Renal Failure:** The patient's ARF is likely exacerbated by her heart failure and poor forward flow, and if not managed properly, can lead to further renal dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's severe LE edema and hypotension increase the risk of pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. **Infection:** The patient's LLE hematoma and potential contamination of the wound increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of diastolic CHF increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. **Anemia:** The patient's ongoing GI bleed and potential blood loss from the LLE hematoma can lead to further anemia, which can exacerbate her hypotension and other medical complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Continue supportive care:** Continue to provide supportive care, including dopamine, morphine, and protonix, to manage the patient's hypotension, GI bleeding, and anemia.
2. **Monitor closely:** Monitor the patient's vital signs, electrolytes, and renal function closely to detect any changes or complications.
3. **Consider diuresis:** Consider diuresis to manage the patient's pulmonary edema and potential cardiac complications.

   moderately hypotensive from baseline in 120s to 80s-100s systolics.
   Oxygenating well on room air.
   # Hypotension: hypotension likely from hypovolemia, although could be
   multifactorial with beta blockage in the setting of renal failure.  Has
   GI bleed with melena and hct of 17.5, although her baseline is around
   22.  Also had a recent fall with bruising on her back and may have lost
   some blood into hematomas.  Has had nausea, vomiting and poor PO
   intake.  Grossly is extravascularly fluid overload with severe LE
   edema.  Difficult to fluid resucitate due to hx of heart failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed, who presents with acute renal failure and anemia. The patient is moderately hypotensive, with systolic blood pressures ranging from 80s to 100s mmHg. She is oxygenating well on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 6.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 19.3%
* Platelet count: 206 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.3 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 29 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.6 mEq/L
* Chloride: 97 mEq/L
* Calcium: 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 7.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Severe lower extremity (LE) edema
* Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response
* Hypotension
* Nausea and vomiting
* Poor oral intake

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypotension: likely due to hypovolemia, although could be multifactorial with beta blockade in the setting of renal failure
* Anemia: likely from GI losses and possible small losses into hematomas
* Acute renal failure: likely in the setting of worsening heart failure and poor forward flow
* Diastolic CHF: severe diastolic CHF and history of needing midodrine and aggressive diuresis
* Ulcerative colitis: does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in diarrhea, no cramping abdominal pain
* GI bleed: likely due to known telangectasias seen on prior colonoscopy
* Fall: mechanical, tripped on nightgown, with hematoma and warmth on the left leg knee
* Edema: severe LE edema limiting walking

The patient's plan includes:

* Transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs)
* Holding beta blockers and diuretics for now
* Considering central venous catheterization (CVC) if mean arterial pressures (MAPs) consistently <60
* Considering diuresis to see if poor forward flow is the cause of her hypotension
* Echo in the morning to assess cardiac function
* Continuing to support Hct for >23%
* Holding iron supplements for now as the patient is NPO
* Continuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and 3 PIVs for GI bleed
* Following up with GI recommendations
* Considering scope if briskly bleeding
* Holding mesalamine for now as the patient is strictly NPO
* Monitoring respiratory status
* Considering CVL and pressors/diuresis if needed
* Following up with renal recommendations
* Trending creatinine and electrolytes
* Monitoring urine output and electrolytes

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F with hx of severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed who presents today from outpatient
   appointment with ARF and hct of 17.5 likely due to lower GI bleed.  Is
   moderately hypotensive from baseline in 120s to 80s-100s systolics.
   Oxygenating well on room air.
   # Hypotension: hypotension likely from hypovolemia, although could be
   multifactorial with beta blockage in the setting of renal failure.  Has
   GI bleed with melena and hct of 17.5, although her baseline is around
   22.  Also had a recent fall with bruising on her back and may have lost
   some blood into hematomas.  Has had nausea, vomiting and poor PO
   intake.  Grossly is extravascularly fluid overload with severe LE
   edema.  Difficult to fluid resucitate due to hx of heart failure.

   - hct q6hrs
   - goal Hct >23
   - hold BB and diuretics for now
   - consider CVL if MAPs consistently <60
   - consider diuresis to see if poor forward flow is the cause of her
   hypotension

   # GI bleed: likely due to known telangectasias seen on prior
   colonoscopy.  Had hemeoccult negative gastric lavage and negative upper
   endoscopy in [**Month (only) 1088**] so will not scope tonight.

   - consider scope
   # Anemia: as above, likely from GI losses and possible small loses into
   hematomas.
   - transfuse for Hct <23
   - hold Fe for now as NPO
   # Ulcerative colitis: does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no cramping abdominal pain.
   - hold mesalamine for now as is strickly NPO
   - f/u GI recs
   - no indication for steroids or immunesuppressants now
   # Diastolic CHF: has severe diastolic CHF and history of needing
   midodrine and aggressive diuresis.  On exam and based on history seems
   to be more likely intravascularly depleted in the setting of total body
   overload.  Due to her hypotension are limited in our ability to
   diurese.
   - hold diuretics for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   - mostly right sided, so will follow LFTs
   - consider CVL and pressors/diuresis if needed
   # ARF: acute on chronic renal failure, likely in the setting of
   worsening heart failure and poor forward flow.  Seen in outpatient
   renal today, had renal US that was normal.  Electrolytes stable, no
   evidence of uremia on exam.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed. She was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and hypotension. She has been receiving dopamine infusion and has received 3 units of PRBCs. Her vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.4°C (95.8°F)
* Heart rate: 109 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient has severe lower extremity edema, and her laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 17.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 21.7%
* White blood cell count: 5.3 K/μL
* Platelet count: 206 K/μL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 101 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right lower extremity edema: 3+
* Left lower extremity edema: 3+
* L leg with swollen and warm knee, hematoma
* Cool skin

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs
* Goal hemoglobin >23
* Holding beta blockers and diuretics for now
* Consider central venous line if MAPs consistently <60
* Consider diuresis to assess for poor forward flow
* Echo in the morning to assess cardiac function
* Protonix 40 mg q12hrs for GI bleed
* F/u GI recommendations
* Consider RBC scan and IR angiography if bleeding is brisk
* Consider scope

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypotension due to hypovolemia or beta blockade
* GI bleed due to telangiectasias or other causes
* Anemia due to GI losses and possible small losses into hematomas
* Diastolic CHF exacerbation due to fluid overload and poor forward flow
* ARF due to worsening heart failure and poor forward flow
* Infection due to hematoma or other sources
* Respiratory failure due to fluid overload and poor lung function
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and fluid overload

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yF with hx of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization
   for LGIB who presented here from an OP appointment with ARF and Hct of
   17.5 and melenotic, guiac positive stools.
   #) Anemia/Blood loss--two sources, lower GI (multiple bleeding
   angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy [**2109-1-30**]) or hematoma from
   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture. Baseline Hct 22. Now
   off pressors
   - Continue transfusing for Hct goal >23
   - Giving lasix with transfusions given heart failure
   - F/u AM Hct (post-transfusion)
   - Hct q6h
   - Follow-up with GI/scope plans
   - If continues to re-bleed with hypotension, consider CT scan of legs
   (and possibly abdomen) to assess for hematoma and/or RBC scan and
   angiography
   - F/u social work consult
   - F/u serial lactates
   - Arterial line placed
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider PA catheter
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.8 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils.
   - Continue blood resuscitation as above
   - Medication review to determine any offender
   - Follow urine output carefully
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine while patient is NPO
   - F/u with GI
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture
   - Continue to monitor right knee and if ongoing signs of blood loss
   will consider CT of legs
   - Social Work consult
   - Pain control: tylenol for now; avoid morphine when BP is tenuous.
   #) FEN: NPO, no IVF, replete electrolytes
   #) Ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, anemia, and melenotic, guiac-positive stools. She has undergone multiple transfusions and is currently receiving treatment for blood loss and anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, and platelet count of 99 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a very small pericardial effusion around the atria. Her electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.

The patient's plan includes continuing transfusions to achieve a hemoglobin level greater than 23, administering lasix with transfusions given her heart failure, and following up with gastrointestinal and scope plans. She is also being monitored for signs of bleeding and hypotension, and consideration is being given to placing a pulmonary artery catheter.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is still low, and she may continue to bleed, which could lead to further anemia and hypovolemic shock.
2. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is severe, and she may experience further decompensation, which could lead to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and death.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is severe, and she may experience further worsening of her condition, which could lead to right ventricular failure and death.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in nature, and she may experience further worsening of her condition, which could lead to chronic kidney disease and death.
5. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis is stable, but she may experience further exacerbation of her condition, which could lead to severe colitis, sepsis, and death.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is slow, but she may experience further worsening of her condition, which could lead to stroke, cardiogenic shock, and death.
7. Hematoma: The patient's right knee hematoma may continue to bleed, which could lead to further anemia and hypovolemic shock.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly given her immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central venous catheter and arterial line."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yF with hx of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization
   for LGIB who presented here from an OP appointment with ARF and Hct of
   17.5 and melenotic, guiac positive stools.
   #) Anemia/Blood loss--two sources, lower GI (multiple bleeding
   angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy [**2109-1-30**]) or hematoma from
   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture. Baseline Hct 22. Now
   off pressors
   - Continue transfusing for Hct goal >23
   - Giving lasix with transfusions given heart failure
   - F/u AM Hct (post-transfusion)
   - Hct q6h
   - Follow-up with GI/scope plans
   - Will order CT scan of torso  and lower extremities to eval for RP
   bleed , fracture, hematoma, or other source of blood loss
   - F/u social work consult
   - F/u serial lactates
   - Arterial line placed
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider PA catheter
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.8 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils.
   - Continue blood resuscitation as above
   - Medication review to determine any offender
   - Follow urine output carefully
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine while patient is NPO
   - F/u with GI
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture
   - Continue to monitor right knee and if ongoing signs of blood loss
   will consider CT of legs
   - Social Work consult
   - Pain control: tylenol for now; avoid morphine when BP is tenuous.
   #) Pain control
   - Will give lidoderm patch for now
   - Will hold opiates, but can consider if BP tolerates
   #) FEN:  no IVF, replete electrolytes, will advance diet as tolerated
   #) Ppx
pneumoboots. Holding heparin due to bleed
   #) Access: CVL in R IJ, Arterial Line
   #) Communication: Patient and son [**Name (NI) 789**]
   #) Code: Full
   #) Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, AFib, and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, anemia, and lower GI bleeding. The patient has undergone multiple transfusions, and her Hct is currently 21.9%. She has been weaned off pressors and is receiving lasix with transfusions due to heart failure. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is at risk for pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Hypertension and Right Ventricular Failure:** The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided CHF puts her at risk for worsening pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, which could lead to further decompensation of her heart failure.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which could worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of mortality.
3. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's ongoing GI bleeding could lead to further blood loss, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. **Right Knee Hematoma:** The patient's right knee hematoma may continue to bleed, leading to further blood loss and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. **Pain Control:** The patient's pain management is a concern, as morphine may not be tolerated due to her hypotension. Alternative pain management strategies will be necessary to ensure her comfort and prevent further complications.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly her low potassium levels, may worsen her cardiac function and increase her risk of arrhythmias.
7. **Infection:** The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing GI bleeding increase her risk of infection, which could lead to further complications and mortality.
8. **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** The patient's AFib may worsen, leading to further cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, including pulmonary hypertension, AKI, GI bleeding, right knee hematoma, pain control issues, electrolyte imbalance, infection, and cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these complications will be necessary to ensure the patient's safety and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yF with hx of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization
   for LGIB who presented here from an OP appointment with ARF and Hct of
   17.5 and melenotic, guiac positive stools.
   #) Anemia/Blood loss--two sources, lower GI (multiple bleeding
   angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy [**2109-1-30**]) or hematoma from
   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
   CT shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleed.
   Baseline Hct 22. Hct stable at 23.1
   - Continue Q8h hematocrit checks
   - Follow-up with GI/scope plans--plan to scope when patient is GI
   - F/u serial lactates
   - Wean off pressors
   - Arterial line placed
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure. Patient is total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings
   and respiratory status.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider PA catheter
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.4 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils. Mesalamine known to
   cause long-term or acute on chronic interstitial nephritis is 1% of
   cases; if this is relevant to her, then the improvement in her renal
   function may also be due to withholding the drug in the setting of
   being NPO.
   - Continue to support volume status as above
   - Will touch base with renal and GI re: mesalamine
   - Goal urine output: 40cc's hour
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture. CT
   prelim read shows large hematoma.
   - Continue to monitor left knee
   - F/u final CT read
   - Social Work consulted; patient feels safe at home and reportedly
   husband has moved out.
   - Pain control: tylenol and lidocaine patch for now; avoid morphine
   when BP is tenuous.
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine for now, will check with GI and renal if okay to
   continue (?possible cause of AIN)
   - Per GI, while patient is not having bowel movements conduct serial
   abdominal exams and in indicated serial KUBs
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) Pain control
   - Will give lidoderm patch for now
   - Will hold opiates, but can consider if BP tolerates
   #) FEN:  no IVF, replete electrolytes, can advance diet today.
   #) Ppx
pneumoboots. Holding heparin due to bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Arterial line placed
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure. Patient is total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings
   and respiratory status.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider PA catheter
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.4 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils. Mesalamine known to
   cause long-term or acute on chronic interstitial nephritis is 1% of
   cases; if this is relevant to her, then the improvement in her renal
   function may also be due to withholding the drug in the setting of
   being NPO.
   - Continue to support volume status as above
   - Will touch base with renal and GI re: mesalamine
   - Goal urine output: 40cc's hour
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture. CT
   prelim read shows large hematoma.
   - Continue to monitor left knee
   - F/u final CT read
   - Social Work consulted; patient feels safe at home and reportedly
   husband has moved out.
   - Pain control: tylenol and lidocaine patch for now; avoid morphine
   when BP is tenuous.
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine for now, will check with GI and renal if okay to
   continue (?possible cause of AIN)
   - Per GI, while patient is not having bowel movements conduct serial
   abdominal exams and in indicated serial KUBs
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) Pain control
   - Will give lidoderm patch for now
   - Will hold opiates, but can consider if BP tolerates

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, anemia, and a hematoma in her left knee. She had a recent hospitalization for LGIB and presented with ARF and melenotic, guiac-positive stools. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 133/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine, and eosinophilia in her urine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is low. This may be due to pre-renal failure, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a hematoma in her left knee and a history of GI bleeding. She is at risk for further bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulants.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CHF and pulmonary hypertension. She is at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is at risk for infection, especially with the use of immunosuppressive medications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of malnutrition, and her laboratory results show low albumin and total protein levels. This may increase her risk for infection and other complications.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and is at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, especially with the use of immunosuppressive medications and the presence of a central line and arterial line.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Consider further evaluation of the patient's kidney function, including a renal ultrasound and a urine analysis.
3. Consider the use of anticoagulants, such as heparin, to prevent further bleeding.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including her heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes.
5. Consider the use of antibiotics to prevent infection, especially in the setting of a central line and arterial line.
6. Consider the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide adequate nutrition and prevent malnutrition.
7. Consider the use of respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), to prevent respiratory complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yF with hx of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization
   for LGIB who presented here from an OP appointment with ARF and Hct of
   17.5 and melenotic, guiac positive stools.
   #) Anemia/Blood loss--two sources, lower GI (multiple bleeding
   angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy [**2109-1-30**]) or hematoma from
   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
   CT shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleed.
   Baseline Hct 22. Hct stable at 23.1
   - Continue Q8h hematocrit checks. Goal transfusion above 23
   - Follow-up with GI/scope plans--plan to scope when patient is stable
   - F/u serial lactates
   - Weaned off pressors now
   - Continue MAP >60 goal
   - Can d/c a-line, d/c central line
   .
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure. Patient is total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Will start spironolactone 25 qD today
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings
   and respiratory status.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.4 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils. Mesalamine known to
   cause long-term or acute on chronic interstitial nephritis is 1% of
   cases; if this is relevant to her, then the improvement in her renal
   function may also be due to withholding the drug in the setting of
   being NPO.
   - Continue to support volume status as above
   - Will touch base with renal and GI re: mesalamine
   - Will hold Asacol for now
   - Goal urine output: 40cc's hour
   .
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture. CT
   prelim read shows large hematoma.
   - Continue to monitor left knee
   - F/u final CT read
   - Social Work consulted; patient feels safe at home and reportedly
   husband has moved out.
   - Pain control: tylenol and lidocaine patch for now; avoid morphine
   when BP is tenuous.
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine for now, will check with GI and renal if okay to
   continue (?possible cause of AIN)
   - Per GI, while patient is not having bowel movements conduct serial
   abdominal exams and in indicated serial KUBs
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) Pain control
   - Will give lidoderm patch for now
   - Will hold opiates, but can consider if BP tolerates
   - Will restart Gabapentin today

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ulcerative colitis. She presented to the ICU with acute renal failure, anemia, and melena. She was found to have a large hematoma on her left knee and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 133/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Her imaging studies, including a chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan, show no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleeding.

The patient's plan includes continuing to monitor her respiratory status, starting spironolactone 25 mg daily, and considering diuretics during transfusion based on central venous pressure (CVP) readings and respiratory status. The patient will also be followed up with GI and scope plans, and serial lactate levels will be checked.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and her recent fall.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to be a major concern, given her history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to be a major concern, given her history of chronic kidney disease and her recent fall.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's recent fall and hematoma on her left knee may put her at risk for further bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's recent fall and her history of ulcerative colitis may put her at risk for infection.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's recent fall and her history of chronic kidney disease may put her at risk for malnutrition.
7. Pain management: The patient's recent fall and her history of chronic kidney disease may put her at risk for pain management issues.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's recent fall and her history of chronic kidney disease may put her at risk for electrolyte imbalance.
9. Blood transfusion reaction: The patient's recent fall and her history of chronic kidney disease may put her at risk for a blood transfusion reaction.
10. Sepsis: The patient's recent fall and her history of chronic kidney disease may put her at risk for sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging:
   Abd/Chest/Pelvis: no retroperitoneal hematoma, extensive subQ edema and
   bilateral pleural effusions, trace ascites, biliary sludge
   Lower extremity (prelim): L hematoma
   Assessment and Plan
   63yF with hx of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis with recent hospitalization
   for LGIB who presented here from an OP appointment with ARF and Hct of
   17.5 and melenotic, guiac positive stools.
   #) Anemia/Blood loss--two sources, lower GI (multiple bleeding
   angioectasias noted on previous colonoscopy [**2109-1-30**]) or hematoma from
   fall. Plain films show no evidence of fracture and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
   CT shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other bleed.
   Baseline Hct 22. Hct stable at 23.1
   - Continue Q8h hematocrit checks. Goal transfusion above 23
   - Follow-up with GI/scope plans--plan to scope when patient is stable
   - F/u serial lactates
   - Weaned off pressors now
   - Continue MAP >60 goal
   - Can d/c a-line, d/c central line
   .
   #) Diastolic, right-sided CHF with pulmonary hypertension. Echo report
   shows no major changes compared to prior studies. Elevated CVP likely
   owing to underlying severe right-heart failure. Patient is total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - Will start spironolactone 25 qD today
   - Consideration of diuretics during transfusion based on CVP readings
   and respiratory status.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure
acute on chronic with Creatinine of 2.4 although
   baseline is 1.5-2.0. FeNA is 0.1. Likely pre-renal in the setting of GI
   bleed, but urine was positive for eosinophils. Mesalamine known to
   cause long-term or acute on chronic interstitial nephritis is 1% of
   cases; if this is relevant to her, then the improvement in her renal
   function may also be due to withholding the drug in the setting of
   being NPO.
   - Continue to support volume status as above
   - Will touch base with renal and GI re: mesalamine
   - Will hold Asacol for now
   - Goal urine output: 40cc's hour
   .
   #) S/p Fall with R knee hematoma. Plain films without fracture. CT
   prelim read shows large hematoma.
   - Continue to monitor left knee
   - F/u final CT read
   - Social Work consulted; patient feels safe at home and reportedly
   husband has moved out.
   - Pain control: tylenol and lidocaine patch for now; avoid morphine
   when BP is tenuous.
   #) Ulcerative colitis
stable; no diarrhea or abdominal pain
   - Holding mesalamine for now, will check with GI and renal if okay to
   continue (?possible cause of AIN)
   - Per GI, while patient is not having bowel movements conduct serial
   abdominal exams and in indicated serial KUBs
   #) Atrial fibrillation: slow, ventricular response
   - Holding beta-blockers in setting of hypotension. Will monitor BP and
   resume beta-blockers if patient
s pressure can tolerate and no clinical
   evidence of ongoing blood loss.
   #) Pain control
   - Will give lidoderm patch for now
   - Will hold opiates, but can consider if BP tolerates
   - Will restart Gabapentin today
   #) FEN:  no IVF, replete electrolytes, can advance diet today.
   #) Ppx
pneumoboots. Holding heparin due to bleed
   #) Access: CVL in R IJ, Arterial Line
   #) Communication: Patient and son [**Name (NI) 789**]
   #) Code: Full
   #) Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe right-sided and diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, afib, and ulcerative colitis who presented to the ICU with acute renal failure (ARF) and hematochezia. She was admitted from an outpatient appointment with a Hct of 17.5 and melenotic, guiac-positive stools. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently on a goal MAP of >60. She has a CVP of 23 mmHg and is total body volume overloaded but likely intravascularly dry.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia and blood loss from two sources: lower GI bleeding and a hematoma from a fall. She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is likely pre-renal in the setting of GI bleed. The patient's creatinine level is 2.4, although her baseline is 1.5-2.0. The FeNA is 0.1, and the urine was positive for eosinophils.

The patient's pain control is being managed with tylenol and lidocaine patch, and she is being monitored for left knee hematoma. She is also being monitored for atrial fibrillation, which is slow and ventricular response. The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, and she is being advanced to a diet today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's CVP is elevated, and she is total body volume overloaded, which may lead to hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from two sources, and she may continue to bleed, which could worsen her anemia and blood loss.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, but she may still be at risk for electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen her cardiac and renal function.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and may be at risk for infection, which could worsen her condition.
7. Thrombosis: The patient has a central line and arterial line, and she may be at risk for thrombosis, which could worsen her condition.
8. Fall risk: The patient has a history of falls and may be at risk for further falls, which could worsen her condition."
