   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q6h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider early renal consult for ?need for HD to get through acute
   period if developing anuric ATN.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Right IJ, peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q6h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider early renal consult for ?need for HD to get through acute
   period if developing anuric ATN.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, leading to hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from acute RP bleed. The patient has undergone coiling of the pseudoaneurysm to stop the hemorrhage.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 100 bpm (89-134 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/62 mmHg (82-156/99 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute (8-24 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has a history of oliguria, with urine output ranging from 15-50 mL/hour, and is currently being transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's hematocrit has drifted down to 24.7%.

The patient has also developed hypoxic respiratory failure, which is being managed with minimal ventilator settings. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from the acute bleed and shock, ARDS, and PE.

The patient has a low urine output, which is likely related to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal factors, ATN, or mass compression of the kidney, ureter, and vessels. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis from shock and AKI.

The patient has a leukocytosis, which is likely reactive from acute stressors.

The patient's current medications include:

* Fentanyl (concentrate) 175 mcg/hour
* Propofol 80 mcg/kg/min
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Calcium supplements

The patient's plan includes:

* Maintenance of excellent IV access
* Monitoring of CVP, goal CVP 8-12
* Trending of Hct every 6 hours
* Transfusion of Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding
* Monitoring of INR < 1.5, Plts > 50, and f'gen > 100
* Consideration of early renal consult for potential need for hemodialysis
* Consideration of bicarb and mucomyst for AKI

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hypothermia
* Leukocytosis
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ failure

The patient's current condition is stable, but the patient's potential for complications is high due to the presence of multiple medical conditions and the need for ongoing medical management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Right IJ, peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney and IVC compression, presenting with hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from an acute bleed. She underwent coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage, with no evidence of residual bleed. The patient's labs are improving, with a decrease in metabolic acidosis and lactate, and pressor requirements/BPs are also improving. However, she still has poor urine output, which is a concern.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's acute bleed and shock are ongoing concerns, and further bleeding may occur.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure due to acute bleed and shock, and may require ongoing respiratory support.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's low urine output and oliguria may indicate ARF, which could be due to prerenal, ischemic, or tubular causes.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may persist due to ongoing shock, renal failure, or other causes.
5. Hypothermia: The patient was initially hypothermic but has been normothermic since being taken off the Bair hugger.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's reactive leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response to acute stressors.
7. Retroperitoneal Mass: The patient's retroperitoneal mass may be a hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection, schwannoma, or Castleman disease, and a tissue diagnosis may be deferred until she is more medically stable.
8. Bowel Necrosis: The patient's coiling procedure may have compromised blood supply to the duodenum, leading to potential bowel necrosis.
9. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis may persist due to ongoing shock, hypoperfusion, or other causes.
10. Infection: The patient's low threshold for antibiotics and the presence of a retroperitoneal mass make infection a potential concern.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will be closely monitored for signs of ongoing hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ARF, metabolic acidosis, and other complications. She will receive ongoing fluid resuscitation, pressor support, and respiratory support as needed. Further imaging studies, including CT and MRI, may be necessary to determine the extent of the retroperitoneal mass and any potential complications. The patient will also require ongoing management of her electrolytes, acid-base status, and glucose levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been in the ICU for an unknown duration, with a chief complaint of oliguric kidney failure. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/62 mmHg. His respiratory support is being managed with a ventilator, and he is receiving oxygen therapy. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 124 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. His creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is still receiving mechanical ventilation. He may require further adjustments to his ventilator settings or additional respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's oliguric kidney failure and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to address this potential complication.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, and his blood pressure is slightly elevated. He may require further fluid management to prevent fluid overload.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly low, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric kidney failure may progress to renal failure if not addressed promptly.
6. Bloodstream infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for a potential bloodstream infection.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and may require prophylactic treatment.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and may require prophylactic treatment.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his mechanical ventilation and may require further evaluation and treatment.
10. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, and he may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent hyperglycemia."

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also [**Last Name (LF) 12449**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - Repeat hct 29.6 at 9am (Hct 24.7 at 2am)
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Note thyroid nodules on problem list as above; updated D/C ppwk
   - TSH added on returned 1.9
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also [**Last Name (LF) 12449**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - Repeat hct 29.6 at 9am (Hct 24.7 at 2am)
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Note thyroid nodules on problem list as above; updated D/C ppwk
   - TSH added on returned 1.9
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with retroperitoneal bleeding, acute pancreatitis, and abdominal pain. She has a history of trauma, pancreatitis, and duodenal ulceration/inflammation. The patient was previously intubated and is now on invasive ventilation. She has been experiencing pain, nausea, and agitation, and has been receiving morphine and dilaudid to manage her symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/81 mmHg.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Retroperitoneal bleeding: The patient has a large pseudoaneurysm in the retroperitoneal space, which is causing compression of the mesenteric vessels and acute renal compromise.
2. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of pancreatitis on imaging studies, which is likely contributing to her abdominal pain and nausea.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing severe abdominal pain, which is likely related to the retroperitoneal bleeding and pancreatitis.
4. Nausea and agitation: The patient is experiencing nausea and agitation, which is likely related to her pain and the medications she is receiving.
5. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient has developed hypertension and tachycardia, which is likely related to her pain and the medications she is receiving.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's retroperitoneal bleeding could worsen, leading to further complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis could worsen, leading to further complications such as sepsis and organ failure.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing an infection, particularly in the retroperitoneal space.
4. Kidney damage: The patient's acute renal compromise could worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring: The patient's vital signs and laboratory results will be closely monitored to assess her response to treatment.
2. Pain management: The patient's pain will be managed with a combination of medications, including morphine and dilaudid.
3. Nutrition: The patient will receive total parenteral nutrition to support her nutritional needs.
4. Blood pressure management: The patient's blood pressure will be closely monitored and managed with medication as needed.
5. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive respiratory support with invasive ventilation.
6. Infection prevention: The patient will receive antibiotics to prevent infection, and her wound will be closely monitored for signs of infection.
7. Renal support: The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and she will receive fluid and electrolyte management as needed.
8. Surgical intervention: The patient may require surgical intervention to repair her retroperitoneal bleeding and pancreatitis."

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also nauseous, will try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, leading to hypotension and hemorrhagic shock. The patient underwent coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage, and the labs are improving, including metabolic acidosis, lactate, and pressor requirements/BPs.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to the retroperitoneal mass and the recent coiling procedure. Close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and fluid resuscitation is essential.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure due to the acute bleed and shock. Extubation was successful, and the patient is now oxygenating and ventilating well on room air. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
3. Retroperitoneal mass: The differential diagnosis includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection, schwannoma, or Castleman disease. Further imaging and tissue diagnosis are needed to determine the cause of the mass.
4. Low urine output: The patient's urine output is low, likely due to acute renal failure (ARF) or prerenal azotemia. Close monitoring of CVPs, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a combination of lactic acidosis from shock and possible renal failure-related acidosis. Management of shock, oliguria, and electrolyte imbalance is essential.
6. Hypothermia: The patient was initially hypothermic, but is now normothermic. Continuous monitoring of temperature and blood pressure is necessary to prevent further hypothermia.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has reactive leukocytosis due to acute stressors. Close monitoring of white blood cell count and differential is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from the retroperitoneal mass and may be at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of abdominal exam, lactates, and films for free air is necessary.

The patient's medications include:

* Morphine sulfate
* Fentanyl
* Propofol
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Metoprolol
* Atropine
* Calcium gluconate

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.7%
* White blood cell count: 11.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 124 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
* Sodium: 145 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.6 mEq/L
* Chloride: 28.2%
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 1.9

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT abdomen/pelvis: extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm
* Abdominal ultrasound: completed but not read
* Chest X-ray: no evidence of pneumonia

The patient's clinical status is stable, but the patient requires close monitoring and management of the potential medical complications listed above."

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours. Hemodynamically stable.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access
 good PIV access now; will plan to pull
   old CVL from OSH.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   - No longer necessary to trend bladder pressures
   - Change to PO Dilaudid for pain control
   - F/U CT in [**3-21**] weeks
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD eventually to rule out
   acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   - F/U abdominal US done this morning
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.  Resolved.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO - ADAT, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed
   recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PO PPI
   # Access: Right IJ (may pull today), peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

   CT Abdomen ([**4-19**])
   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation
   posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
   Etiology of
   this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to prior trauma,
   pancreatitis or
   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident
   Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and the patient
   was
   referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression
   by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be evaluated
   during
   angiography.
   3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm,
   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours. Hemodynamically stable.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access
 good PIV access now; will plan to pull
   old CVL from OSH.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   - No longer necessary to trend bladder pressures
   - Change to PO Dilaudid for pain control
   - F/U CT in [**3-21**] weeks
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD eventually to rule out
   acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   - F/U abdominal US done this morning
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.  Resolved.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO - ADAT, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed
   recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PO PPI
   # Access: Right IJ (may pull today), peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of the right kidney and IVC compression, who presented with hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from an acute RP bleed. The patient has undergone coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage, and labs are improving, with a decrease in metabolic acidosis, lactate, and pressor requirements/BPs.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed:

1. Shock: The patient is at risk of developing shock due to the ongoing bleeding and compression of the IVC. The patient's CVP should be monitored, and INR should be kept < 1.5 to prevent further bleeding.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of acute bleed and shock. The patient is now oxygenating and ventilating well on room air, but should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress.
3. Retroperitoneal Mass: The differential for an enhancing retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman disease. A tissue diagnosis of the mass is deferred until the patient is more medically stable.
4. Low Urine Output: The patient has low urine output, which may be due to new ARF, prerenal failure, or compression of the kidney/vessels/ureter. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening kidney function, and fluid resuscitation should be continued.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a combination of lactic acidosis from shock and possible renal failure-related acidosis. The patient's metabolic acidosis should be closely monitored and managed with bicarbonate therapy if necessary.
6. Hypothermia: The patient was initially hypothermic, but has been normothermic since being taken off the Bair hugger. The patient should be monitored for any signs of hypothermia, and blood and urine cultures should be sent.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has reactive leukocytosis from acute stressors, which has resolved.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Coiling by interventional radiology to stop the hemorrhage
2. Maintenance of excellent IV access
3. Monitoring of CVP, goal CVP 8-12
4. Trending of Hct Q8-12h
5. Transfusion of Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding
6. Monitoring of respiratory status s/p extubation
7. Further history from family re:?chronic or acute pancreatitis
8. RUQ ultrasound
9. EGD to rule out acute or chronic duodenal ulcer
10. F/U abdominal US
11. Consideration of bicarb/mucomyst for metabolic acidosis
12. Renal function and UOP improvement trended and followed closely
13. Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability
14. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
15. Communication with husband and family regarding the patient's condition and plan of care."
