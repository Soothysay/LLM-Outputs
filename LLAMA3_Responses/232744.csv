   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.  CT
   scan with left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement
   with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic
   gutter.  UA positive for infection.  No evidence for other abdominal
   infection, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She received vancomycin
   and unasyn in the ED, however UCx from [**11-13**] showed E. coli resistent
   to Unasyn, Bactrim.  Will treat with Cipro, Vanco until further
   sensitivities are obtained.
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Possible adrenal insufficiency.  Stress dose steroids.  Was given
   hydrocortisone on admission to ICU.  Will change to dexamethasone and
   check cosyntropin test
   - Levophed to maintain MAP to goal >60.  If second [**Doctor Last Name **] required will
   choose Vasopressin, however if sVO2 is low consider dobutamine.
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Low svO2 on bedside monitoring.  Concern for cardiac contribution to
   current picture - check echocardiogram and trend cardiac enzymes.
   - Central access obtained and confirmed on CXR.  Early goal directed
   therapy with IVF as tolerated.
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Monitor fever curve and treat with
   acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   - Check amylase, lipase to rule out pancreatitis
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Occurred in ED during fever, rigors.  No
   underlying lung pathology although now CXR is fluid overloaded.
   Intubated in the ED for airway protection given altered mental status.
   Hypotensive on propofol.
   - Wean vent as above overnight.
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - Versed/Fentanyl for sedation.  Hold further propofol.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.
   - Check RSBI in the morning.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive, ie improving from a septic
   standpoint, will diurese and extubate as soon as possible.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology
   - Hydrate as above.  Trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   - As patient is septic will give insulin gtt with q1H finger sticks.
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.  Will restart standing
   insulin 70U once improved hemodynamically.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue outpatient regimen.
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.

   #FEN
   - NPO as diet overnight.  If not able to extubate, amylase/lipase ok
   will start TF
   - IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD who presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, pending further sensitivities.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 102.6°F, Tcurrent 99.7°F, HR 98 bpm, BP 131/70 mmHg, RR 22 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 20.2 K/uL, Hct 30.2%, Plt 198 K/uL, Cr 1.3 mg/dL, TropT 0.28 ng/mL, TCO2 17 mmHg, Glucose 218 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-nourished and overweight, with an endotracheal tube and OG tube in place. Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 heart sound, with a diminished radial pulse and pedal pulses. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds, with symmetric expansion and resonance. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and skin examination reveals a cool temperature with no rash.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or cardiac dysfunction.
* Adrenal insufficiency, given the patient's history of sepsis and the use of hydrocortisone and stress dose steroids.
* Pancreatitis, given the patient's history of DM2 and the elevated amylase and lipase levels.
* DVT or pulmonary embolism, given the patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and the use of heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
* Aspiration pneumonia, given the patient's history of sepsis and the use of sedation and intubation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics pending further sensitivities.
* Monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings.
* Managing the patient's sepsis with stress dose steroids, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation.
* Weaning the patient off ventilatory support and extubating as soon as possible.
* Managing the patient's diabetes with insulin gtt and q1H finger sticks.
* Continuing outpatient regimen for hypercholesterolemia and GERD.
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and monitoring for VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 58-year-old female, is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Tachycardia: 98 beats per minute (bpm)
* Tachypnea: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Hypotension: 131/70 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Intubated and ventilated with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute
* Cardiac rhythm: Sinus tachycardia
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count: 20.2 K/uL
	+ Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 198 K/uL
	+ Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 17 mg/dL
	+ Serum glucose: 238 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 0.28 ng/mL
	+ Lactic acid: 3.5 mmol/L
* Imaging studies:
	+ CT scan: Left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement with a small amount of free fluid in the left paracolic gutter
	+ Chest X-ray:? new retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Discontinuation of vancomycin due to growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in urine and blood
* Continuation of ciprofloxacin for GNR coverage
* Monitoring of micro data: urine, blood, and stool cultures
* Discontinuation of steroids
* Maintenance of central venous pressure (CVP) between 12 mmHg
* Trending of lactate and bands on complete blood count (CBC)
* Monitoring of fever curve and treatment with acetaminophen
* Holding of oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan and HCTZ
* Intubation and ventilation until acidosis improves
* Consideration of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today if acidosis improves
* Hydration and trend of creatinine
* Restart of standing insulin 70U later today if fasting serum glucose (FS) normalizes
* Continue outpatient regimen for hypercholesterolemia
* Continue PPI for GERD
* NPO as diet overnight, and if unable to extubate, start tube feeds
* IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12
* Repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
* Repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Bowel meds

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* DVT and pulmonary embolism
* VAP and pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pancreatitis
* Septic shock

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the medical plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure, likely due to pyelonephritis/urosepsis. She has received 10L of IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors. She is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.6°F, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She has a GNR bacteremia and a retrocardiac opacity on imaging.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and respiratory failure may lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
2. Antibiotic-resistant infection: The patient's GNR bacteremia may be resistant to antibiotics, making treatment challenging and increasing the risk of treatment failure.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's elevated troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram suggest cardiac involvement, which may lead to further cardiovascular instability.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic nongap acidosis may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further complications.
6. Hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia: The patient's severe hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia may exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac dysfunction.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor oral intake and prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and poor circulation may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
9. DVT and pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism.
10. ICU-acquired weakness: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and sedation may lead to ICU-acquired weakness, which may impact her ability to wean from the ventilator."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

She has metabolic nongap acidosis with an anion gap of 12, and respiratory alkalosis to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. She also has severe hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia due to poor PO intake, insulin administration, and positive pressure ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and urosepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and positive pressure ventilation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin and negative CKMB can indicate cardiac injury, and the use of insulin and positive pressure ventilation can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's septic shock and urosepsis can lead to acute kidney injury, and her pre-existing kidney disease can increase the risk of chronic kidney disease.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's poor PO intake, insulin administration, and positive pressure ventilation can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and poor oxygenation can increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, brain edema, and cerebral vasospasm.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her sepsis, respiratory failure, and other potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.  CT
   scan with left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement
   with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic
   gutter.  UA positive for infection.  No evidence for other abdominal
   infection. Now growing GNRs in urine and blood. CXR with ? new
   retrocardiac opacity but likely atelectasis.
   - Discontinue vanco as growing GNRs.
   - Continue with Cipro for GNR coverage
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - D/C steroids
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Monitor fever curve and treat with
   acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Occurred in ED during fever, rigors.  Minimal
   fluid overload on cxr. Now with metabolic acidosis. Will keep intubated
   until acidosis improves. Consider SBT later today if acidosis
   improving.
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - Versed/Fentanyl for sedation.  Hold further propofol as patient
   became hypotensive.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   .
   # Elevated CK:
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Creatinine trending
   down.
   - Hydrate as above.  Trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   .
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.
   - Will restart standing insulin 70U later today if FS normalize.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue outpatient regimen.
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #FEN
   - NPO as diet overnight.  If not able to extubate, start tube feeds
   - IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12
   - replete lytes PRN
   .
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, subclavian line
   .
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
   - replete lytes PRN
   - bowel meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD, who was admitted with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis. She has been treated with antibiotics and has shown some improvement, but still has a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is intubated due to respiratory distress and has a history of altered mental status. Her creatinine levels are elevated, and she has acute renal failure. She also has anemia and is being treated with blood products. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is receiving various medications and treatments to manage her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue to worsen if not properly managed. She requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment with antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue if not properly managed. She requires close monitoring of her respiratory status, and treatment with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely to continue if not properly managed. She requires close monitoring of her renal function, and treatment with fluids and medications to manage her electrolyte imbalance.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue if not properly managed. She requires close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels, and treatment with blood products and medications to manage her anemia.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular system is at risk of complications due to her sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She requires close monitoring of her cardiac status, and treatment with medications and fluids to manage her blood pressure and cardiac function.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is at risk of complications due to her sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She requires close monitoring of her neurological status, and treatment with medications and fluids to manage her symptoms.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a secondary infection due to her sepsis and respiratory failure. She requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment with antibiotics.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal system is at risk of complications due to her sepsis and respiratory failure. She requires close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status, and treatment with medications and fluids to manage her symptoms.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, anemia, cardiovascular complications, neurological complications, infection, and gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   fluid overload on cxr. Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered. Required versed and fentanyl overnight. Will
   attempt  AM wake up and extubation
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT and possible extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative
   - avoid benzos
   - consider dexmedetomidine for sedation

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis. She has been treated with antibiotics, including cefepime and ciprofloxacin, and has shown some improvement in her condition. However, she still has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and her mental status is altered.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate acute kidney injury. This could be due to prerenal causes, such as hypovolemia, or intrinsic kidney damage.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with increasing oxygen requirements and decreasing lung compliance. She may require mechanical ventilation.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be due to septic encephalopathy, sedatives, or other causes. This could lead to delirium, confusion, and decreased level of consciousness.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is increasing, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis, a condition that can lead to muscle damage and kidney failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, are abnormal, which may lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's infection may be spreading to other parts of her body, including the lungs, liver, and brain, which could lead to further complications.
8. Poor wound healing: The patient's sepsis and altered immune function may impair her ability to heal from wounds, which could lead to delayed healing and increased risk of complications.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's sepsis and altered immune function may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sepsis and altered immune function may lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify potential complications early and initiate appropriate interventions to prevent and manage them."

   Assessment and Plan
   Urosepsis, initially hypotensive, briefly required pressor to maintain
   MAP > 60, normotensive since 9hrs after arrival. Pending speciation of
   GNR.
   Resp failure. Intubated in setting of acute septic shock, mental status
   changes. Doing well on PEEP 0, PS 5. Excellent mechanics. Extubation
   hinging on mental status.
   Mental status issues. Awake but inattentive, does not follow commands,
   mildly agitated. Responds poorly to propofol. Diff dx of delerium:
   deleriogenic sedatives (versed), sepsis, possible ingestion prior to
   admission (outpt med list does not suggest culprit). Plan Haldol now
   and fentanyl boluses if necessary and trial of extubation in a couple
   of hours.
   Urosepsis. Cefipime/cipro.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and urosepsis who was admitted to the ICU in shock. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C) with a spike last night, which was treated with cefipime
* Heart rate: 113 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 147/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 17 mmHg, total fluid intake 2,092 mL, total fluid output 1,032 mL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: overweight/obese
* Eyes/conjunctiva: sclera edema
* Cardiovascular: normal heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory: clear breath sounds, minimal thin secretions
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, obese
* Extremities: absent pulses in both lower extremities
* Neurologic: not attentive, does not follow commands, mildly agitated

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 24.9
* Hct: 30.2
* Plt: 209
* Cr: 1.1
* TropT: 0.36
* TCO2: 14
* Glucose: 180 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/38.8/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 3539/27/0.25, Amylase/Lipase: 27/11, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Urosepsis, initially hypotensive, but now normotensive
* Respiratory failure, intubated due to acute septic shock and mental status changes
* Mental status issues, awake but inattentive, does not follow commands, mildly agitated
* Plan: Haldol and fentanyl boluses as needed, trial of extubation in a couple of hours

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure
* Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or cardiac arrest
* Neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as stress ulceration or bowel obstruction
* Infection-related complications, such as bacteremia or endocarditis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Urosepsis, initially hypotensive, briefly required pressor to maintain
   MAP > 60, normotensive since 9hrs after arrival. Pending speciation of
   GNR.
   Resp failure. Intubated in setting of acute septic shock, mental status
   changes. Doing well on PEEP 0, PS 5. Excellent mechanics. Extubation
   hinging on mental status.
   Mental status issues. Awake but inattentive, does not follow commands,
   mildly agitated. Responds poorly to propofol. Diff dx of delerium:
   deleriogenic sedatives (versed), sepsis, possible ingestion prior to
   admission (outpt med list does not suggest culprit). Plan Haldol now
   and fentanyl boluses if necessary and trial of extubation in a couple
   of hours. If she remains agitated despite haldol and fentanyl will try
   dexmedetomidine.
   Urosepsis. Cefipime/cipro.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and urosepsis who was admitted with shock. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 147/66 mmHg. Her respiratory support is set at CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 658 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level, indicating ongoing sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and lactate levels, which may indicate AKI.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Delirium: The patient's mental status is altered, and she is not following commands, which may be due to sepsis, sedatives, or other factors.
4. Infection control issues: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) due to her prolonged stay in the ICU.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a net fluid loss of 221 mL over the past 24 hours, which may lead to hypovolemia or hypervolemia.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is not monitored, and she is receiving insulin therapy, which may lead to hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, which may indicate cardiac injury or myocardial infarction.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal examination is normal, but she may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and use of anticoagulant therapy."

   Imaging: CT HEAD:There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
   evidence of
   major vascular territorial infarct. There is no edema, shift of
   normally
   midline structures, or effacement of basilar cisterns. The [**Doctor Last Name 734**]-white
   matter
   differentiation is preserved.
   There is no fracture. There has been interval increase in soft tissue
   swelling of the nasopharynx, likely related to prolonged intubation.
   Small
   air-fluid level is noted in the sphenoid sinuses. The other sinuses
   remain
   well aerated.
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of vascular
   territorial
   infarcts.
   CT CHEST:Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   atelectasis,
   redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, perihilar opacities and
   cardiomegaly
   are all consistent with moderate heart failure/fluid overload. No focal
   consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
   Microbiology: CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   This organism may develop resistance to third generation cephalosporins
   during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that are initially
   susceptible may become resistant within three to
   four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections, repeat
   culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third
   generation cephalosporins were used.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive
   - Continue with Cipro and Cefepime for GNR coverage
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Lactate improved.
   - Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered, bp elevated to 220 and tachycardic. Sats dropped
   on ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on
   dexmedetomidine. Underwent CT chest with evidene of pulmonary edema.
   - diuresis as bp tolerates- goal 1L negative
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT and possible extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative. Yesterday continued to be agitated and switched sedation to
   dexmedetomidine which resulted in refractory hypotension despite max
   dose of levophed and neo. D/c'd dexmedetomidine but patient still
   agitated on vent. Therefore had to restart versed while intubated. Had
   CT head that was again negative.
   - continue daily wakeups and SBT with plan for extubation
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte
   abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also
   possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but
   minimal MB fraction. CK now trending down
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Bumped to 1.3. Very
   hypotensive yesterday requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
   -  Trend creatinine
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   .
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.
   - On glargine 55U plus RISS
   .
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #FEN
   - start D5
; consider tube feeds
   - IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, subclavian line
   .
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: CT HEAD:There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
   evidence of
   major vascular territorial infarct. There is no edema, shift of
   normally
   midline structures, or effacement of basilar cisterns. The [**Doctor Last Name 734**]-white
   matter
   differentiation is preserved.
   There is no fracture. There has been interval increase in soft tissue
   swelling of the nasopharynx, likely related to prolonged intubation.
   Small
   air-fluid level is noted in the sphenoid sinuses. The other sinuses
   remain
   well aerated.
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of vascular
   territorial
   infarcts.
   CT CHEST:Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   atelectasis,
   redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, perihilar opacities and
   cardiomegaly
   are all consistent with moderate heart failure/fluid overload. No focal
   consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
   Microbiology: CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   This organism may develop resistance to third generation cephalosporins
   during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that are initially
   susceptible may become resistant within three to
   four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections, repeat
   culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third
   generation cephalosporins were used.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive
   - Continue with Cipro and Cefepime for GNR coverage
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Lactate improved.
   - Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered, bp elevated to 220 and tachycardic. Sats dropped
   on ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on
   dexmedetomidine. Underwent CT chest with evidene of pulmonary edema.
   - diuresis as bp tolerates- goal 1L negative
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT and possible extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative. Yesterday continued to be agitated and switched sedation to
   dexmedetomidine which resulted in refractory hypotension despite max
   dose of levophed and neo. D/c'd dexmedetomidine but patient still
   agitated on vent. Therefore had to restart versed while intubated. Had
   CT head that was again negative.
   - continue daily wakeups and SBT with plan for extubation
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte
   abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also
   possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but
   minimal MB fraction. CK now trending down
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Bumped to 1.3. Very
   hypotensive yesterday requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
   -  Trend creatinine
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   .
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.
   - On glargine 55U plus RISS
   .
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   - Continue with Cipro
   - D/c cefepime
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Lactate improved.
   - Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered, bp elevated to 220 and tachycardic. Sats
   dropped. ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on
   dexmedetomidine. Underwent CT chest with evidence of pulmonary edema.
   Likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema given known history of
   diastolic dysfunction. Also possibly due to upper airway obstruction.
   - diuresis as bp tolerates- goal 1L negative
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT on 0/0 and possible extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative. Yesterday continued to be agitated and switched sedation to
   dexmedetomidine which resulted in refractory hypotension despite max
   dose of levophed and neo. D/c'd dexmedetomidine but patient still
   agitated on vent. Therefore had to restart versed while intubated. Had
   CT head that was again negative.
   - Attempt propofol for sedation
   - avoid benzos
   - continue daily wakeups and SBT with plan for extubation
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte
   abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also
   possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but
   minimal MB fraction. CK now trending down
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Bumped to 1.3. Very
   hypotensive yesterday requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
   -  Trend creatinine
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD who presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. The patient has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 103.2°F (39.6°C)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (75-147 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 117/78 mmHg (93-196/130 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 inspirations per minute (11-22 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 100%
* CVP: 16 mmHg (9-26 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 25.0 (28.2)
* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL (26.7)
* Platelet count: 179 (161)
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL (1.1)
* Troponin-T: 0.36 (0.36)
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L (1.4)
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL (2.9)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of vascular territorial infarcts.
* CT chest: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, perihilar opacities, and cardiomegaly, consistent with moderate heart failure/fluid overload.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
* Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient mental status altered, blood pressure elevated to 220, and tachycardic. Sats dropped. ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on dexmedetomidine.
* Altered mental status: Likely secondary to benzos or septic encephalopathy.
* Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities.
* Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology.
* Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].
* Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.
* Hypercholesterolemia: D/c statin given high CKs.
* GERD: Continue PPI.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue Cipro for urosepsis.
* D/c cefepime.
* Follow micro data: urine, blood, and stool cultures.
* Keep CVP between >12.
* Trend lactate, bands on CBC.
* Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen.
* Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Development of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins during prolonged therapy.
* Flash pulmonary edema due to known history of diastolic dysfunction.
* Upper airway obstruction during subsequent extubation.
* Rhabdo secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities.
* Acute renal failure due to prerenal etiology.
* Septic encephalopathy.
* Benzo withdrawal syndrome.
* Electrolyte abnormalities.

Based on the patient's condition and treatment plan, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to uncontrolled infection.
* Respiratory failure due to prolonged intubation and respiratory distress.
* Cardiac failure due to flash pulmonary edema and diastolic dysfunction.
* Neurological complications such as seizures, coma, or brain death due to septic encephalopathy or benzo withdrawal syndrome.
* Renal failure due to prerenal etiology or acute tubular necrosis.
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.
* Rhabdo secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   1.)  Urosepsis:  Growing GNR from blood and urine.  Urine Cx speciated
   as citrobacter.
             -D/c cefepime, continue cipro for 2 week course
   2.) Resp failure:  Unclear etiology of failure yesterday. Possibilities
   include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema
   (tachy/hypertensive and LVH on old echo), and agitation.
                        -Changed to PSV again today and SBT on 0/0
                        -Diurese today
                        -Check cuff leak
   3.) Altered Mental status:  Continued agitation overnight on 3 of
   versed.  Currently on 5.  Head CT with no acute change. Likely
   etiologies include septic delirium and medication effect. Status
   epilepticus less likely but possible.
        -Change benzo's to propofol and daily wake-ups
        -If AMS persists, will get EEG.
   4.) Rhabdo:  CPK's now trending down.
   5.)  FEN:  Start TF today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   as citrobacter.
             -D/c cefepime, continue cipro for 2 week course
   2.) Resp failure:  Unclear etiology of failure yesterday. Possibilities
   include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema
   (tachy/hypertensive and LVH on old echo), and agitation.

                        -Diurese today
                        -Check cuff leak
   3.) Altered Mental status:  Continued agitation overnight on 3 of
   versed.  Currently on 5.  Head CT with no acute change. Likely
   etiologies include septic delirium and medication effect. Status
   epilepticus less likely but possible.
        -Change benzo's to propofol and daily wake-ups
        -If AMS persists, will get EEG.
   4.) Rhabdo:  CPK's now trending down.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and had a brief period of extubation, but failed and was re-intubated.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Citrobacter, and the blood cultures are growing Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient is being treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a 2-week course.

The patient has respiratory failure, and the etiology is unclear, but possibilities include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema, and agitation. The patient is being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

The patient has altered mental status, which is likely due to septic delirium and medication effect. The patient is being treated with benzodiazepines, but the plan is to switch to propofol and perform daily wake-ups. If the altered mental status persists, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be performed.

The patient has rhabdomyolysis, which is trending down. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and hypertension.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a UTI and blood cultures growing GNR, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which can lead to further complications such as delirium and agitation.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to further complications such as kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
5. FEN: The patient has a femoral venous catheter, which can increase the risk of complications such as bleeding and infection.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and sedation. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   1.)  Urosepsis:  Growing GNR from blood and urine.  Urine Cx speciated
   as citrobacter.
             -D/c cefepime, continue cipro for 2 week course
   2.) Resp failure:  Unclear etiology of failure yesterday. Possibilities
   include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema
   (tachy/hypertensive and LVH on old echo), and agitation.
                        -Changed to PSV again today and SBT on 0/0
                        -Diurese today
                        -Check cuff leak
   3.) Altered Mental status:  Continued agitation overnight on 3 of
   versed.  Currently on 5.  Head CT with no acute change. Likely
   etiologies include septic delirium and medication effect. Status
   epilepticus less likely but possible.
        -Change benzo's to propofol and daily wake-ups
        -If AMS persists, will get EEG.
   4.) Rhabdo:  CPK's now trending down.
   5.)  FEN:  Start TF today.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for several days. The patient has undergone various interventions and has been treated for multiple conditions.

The patient's primary diagnosis is urosepsis, with a growing Gram-negative rod (GNR) cultured from both blood and urine. The urine culture has been speciated as Citrobacter. The patient is being treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a 2-week course.

The patient has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, with an unclear etiology. The possibility of upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema, and agitation are being considered. The patient is being managed with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode.

The patient has also been experiencing altered mental status, with continued agitation overnight. The patient is being treated with midazolam (Versed) and is scheduled to have a head computed tomography (CT) scan. The possible etiologies for the altered mental status include septic delirium, medication effect, and status epilepticus.

The patient has also been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels trending downward.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient is at risk for various complications, including:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's urosepsis may lead to sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Rhabdomyolysis-related complications: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient's urosepsis may lead to infection-related complications, including septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management of multiple conditions. The patient is at risk for various complications, and it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.
   -currently most likely diagnosis is benzo effect on mental status,
   continue to monitor for improving mental status, if does not clear may
   need to call neuro for EEG to r/o status but very unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   #FEN: tube feeds or diet depending on ability to extubate
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, L IJ.  Art Line- dampened
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
   - replete lytes PRN
   - bowel meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.
   -currently most likely diagnosis is benzo effect on mental status,
   continue to monitor for improving mental status, if does not clear may
   need to call neuro for EEG to r/o status but very unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   #FEN: tube feeds or diet depending on ability to extubate
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, L IJ.  Art Line- dampened
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
   - replete lytes PRN
   - bowel meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis, which is a serious infection of the kidneys.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/87 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and her blood gases show a pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and pO2 of 157 mmHg.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 25.0 x 10^9/L, with a band count of 4.0%. Her hemoglobin is 23.7 g/dL, and her platelet count is 179 x 10^9/L. Her blood cultures are positive for Citrobacter, and her urine culture is negative. She is receiving antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, and is being treated with antihypertensives, including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and troponin, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis or demand ischemia. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Her kidney function tests (KFTs) show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD. She has a history of kidney stones and has undergone a kidney biopsy in the past.

The patient's physical examination shows signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Her abdomen is tender to palpation, and her urine output is decreased.

The patient's plan of care includes continued antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and management of her blood pressure and respiratory status. She is also receiving treatment for her diabetes mellitus, including insulin therapy and blood glucose monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's sepsis may cause further kidney damage, leading to AKI.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK and troponin levels may indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can cause muscle damage and kidney failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she may require further management of her blood pressure to prevent complications such as cardiac arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's GERD may cause further complications, including bleeding or perforation of the esophagus.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis may lead to further infection, including pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may indicate a neurological complication, such as non-convulsive status epilepticus.

In summary, the patient is a 58-year-old female with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis, who is receiving treatment in the ICU. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of CK and troponin, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis or demand ischemia. She is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis-induced AKI, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, gastrointestinal complications, infection, and neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.  Call neuro for EEG.
   -in addition given mental status changes and fevers may be useful to
   obtain an MRI to rule out meningneal enhancement as may increase
   likelihood for menginitis, however given urosepsis and clear pyelo on
   CT this is unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 58-year-old female, is a known case of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD, presenting with urosepsis and pyelonephritis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, respiratory distress, altered mental status, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm
* Blood pressure: 111/87 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 25.0-28.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 23.7-24.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 179-192 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.36 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 395 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Cefipime
* Diuresis: Furosemide (Lasix)
* Sedation: Propofol
* Respiratory support: CPAP/PSV
* Nutrition: Tube feeds
* Glycemic control: Sliding scale insulin
* Prophylaxis: Heparin for DVT prophylaxis, PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Meningitis
* Non-convulsive status epilepticus
* Upper airway obstruction
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypokalemia
* Hypophosphatemia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.
   -currently most likely diagnosis is benzo effect on mental status,
   continue to monitor for improving mental status, if does not clear may
   need to call neuro for EEG to r/o status but very unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   #FEN: tube feeds or diet depending on ability to extubate
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, L IJ.  Art Line- dampened

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient, a 58-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with acute mental status changes (AMS) and urosepsis, likely caused by pyelonephritis.
* She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
* The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for pan-sensitive Citrobacter in her urine and blood cultures.
* She is experiencing respiratory distress, with failed attempts at extubation, and is receiving sedation with propofol.
* Her mental status is minimally responsive to verbal stimuli, and she is at risk for non-convulsive status epilepticus.
* The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, likely due to rhabdomyolysis secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities.
* She has acute renal failure, which is improving, and is at risk for nephrotoxicity.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Sepsis and urosepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological complications.
* Respiratory distress can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may require mechanical ventilation.
* Non-convulsive status epilepticus can lead to prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of falls, and cognitive impairment.
* Rhabdomyolysis can cause acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
* Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, can exacerbate rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.

Recommendations:

* Continue antibiotics for pan-sensitive Citrobacter in urine and blood cultures.
* Monitor the patient's mental status closely for signs of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
* Adjust sedation and pain management to minimize respiratory depression.
* Consider adding diuretics to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
* Monitor the patient's creatine kinase levels and electrolyte panels to adjust management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider reintubation if necessary.
* Consider consultation with a neurologist to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus.
* Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin management as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosing accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis now with improved mental status and s/p extubation.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Pt with significantly improved MS this am.
   Following commands and answering questions appropriately. AMS likely
   due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect.
   - avoid benzos, continue to monitor
   .
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter, plan for 14 day course
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed now s/p extubation
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1 liters today
   - given improved MS able to extubate this am
   .
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   pyelonephritis now with improved mental status and s/p extubation.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Pt with significantly improved MS this am.
   Following commands and answering questions appropriately. AMS likely
   due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect.
   - avoid benzos, continue to monitor
   .
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter, plan for 14 day course
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed now s/p extubation

   - given improved MS able to extubate this am
   .
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 58-year-old female, is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of urosepsis, acute kidney injury, and respiratory distress. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, and she is now able to follow commands and respond to verbal stimuli. Her arterial line was placed on May 26th, and she was extubated successfully. She is receiving propofol infusions to maintain sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Her blood cultures are pending, but her urine culture grew Citrobacter, which is pan-sensitive to antibiotics. She is receiving ciprofloxacin and will be treated for 14 days.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with improved oxygenation and ventilation. She is receiving diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload and is being monitored for potential respiratory complications.

Her cardiac status is stable, with normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac ischemia or injury. Her electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and she is receiving potassium and phosphorus supplementation as needed.

The patient's anemia is being managed with iron supplementation and transfusions as needed. Her hypercholesterolemia is being treated with statins, and her GERD is being managed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, or renal failure.
2. Antibiotic resistance: The growth of pan-sensitive Citrobacter may indicate antibiotic resistance, which could complicate treatment and increase the risk of treatment failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to the need for dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring reintubation or other respiratory support measures.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or other cardiac complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced, leading to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, or other complications.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient's ongoing infection may lead to complications such as pneumonia, sinusitis, or other secondary infections.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team should continue to monitor her closely, adjust her treatment plan as needed, and provide aggressive management of her sepsis, respiratory distress, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -surveillance cultures negative
   - Fever curve trending down, Tm 100.1, wbc still elevated
   -hemodynamically stable
   -culture if spikes
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Pt with significantly improved MS this am.
   Following commands and answering questions appropriately. AMS likely
   due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect.
   - avoid benzos, continue to monitor
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Received 18U humalog

Summary:

The patient, a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD, is admitted to the ICU with sepsis from pyelonephritis. She has improved mental status and was extubated. Laboratory results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Plt counts, as well as elevated CK and troponin levels. The patient has a positive urine culture for Citrobacter and a blood culture for pan-sensitive Citrobacter. She is receiving Ciprofloxacin for 14 days.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of progression to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may require further management of her kidney function.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to muscle damage and kidney failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are low, and she may require transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, and she may require insulin therapy to control her blood sugar.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, and she may require supplementation to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are low, and she may require supplementation to prevent muscle weakness and other complications.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to her prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive devices.
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to her prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of PPI and her prolonged hospital stay increase her risk of developing stress ulcer.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Ciprofloxacin for 14 days to treat the patient's sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
3. Consider transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her insulin therapy as needed.
5. Supplement the patient's potassium and phosphate levels as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider antibiotics if pneumonia develops.
7. Consider VTE prophylaxis measures, such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin.
8. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis due to pyelonephritis. She has shown improvement in her mental status, with successful extubation, and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 162/69 mmHg. She has been receiving antibiotics for citrobacter, which has been growing in her urine and blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's sepsis may continue to worsen if the infection is not fully treated, leading to organ failure and increased mortality.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS may recur if her sepsis worsens or if she develops other complications, such as hypoxia or hypoglycemia.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's DM2 may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia may increase her risk of cardiovascular disease if not properly managed.
7. GERD: The patient's GERD may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as esophagitis, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobilization and medical history, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for citrobacter until cultures are negative.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and avoid benzodiazepines.
3. Manage the patient's DM2 with basal insulin, sliding scale, and FS QID.
4. Transfuse the patient for HCT less than 21.
5. Restart statin for hypercholesterolemia.
6. Continue PPI for GERD.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider iron supplementation.
8. Manage the patient's DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF heparin."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female who was admitted with pyelonephritis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She had a dramatic improvement in her mental status and was successfully extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 170/74 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 28.2-25.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 161-266 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-22 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 141 mEq/L, K 3.7 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L
* Glucose: 43-219 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and rhabdomyolysis. She is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin for citrobacter pyelonephritis, and her blood cultures are negative.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Persistent sepsis: The patient's sepsis may not have fully resolved, and she may be at risk for recurrent sepsis or septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may be at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's glucose levels are still elevated, and she may be at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she may be at risk for a hypertensive crisis.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase levels are still elevated, and she may be at risk for further muscle damage or rhabdomyolysis.
7. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient has multiple central lines and peripheral lines, and she may be at risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for citrobacter pyelonephritis
2. Monitoring of blood cultures and urinalysis
3. Management of blood pressure and glucose levels
4. Monitoring of creatine kinase levels and renal function
5. Continued respiratory support
6. Placement of peripherals and discontinuation of total parenteral nutrition
7. Transfer to the floor for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with pyelonephritis, sepsis, and respiratory failure who has dramatically improved in all respects. The patient's mental status has cleared, and she was successfully extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 170/74 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her peripheral pulses are not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 25.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 266 K/uL. Her creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen is 22 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase of 88 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase of 53 IU/L.

The patient's microbiology results show negative cultures for the urinary catheter tip and blood surveillance cultures. The patient's sputum culture is pending.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continuing Ciprofloxacin for 14 days for Citrobacter pyelonephritis, with a change from IV to PO.
2. Restarting Lantus tonight, now that the patient is eating.
3. Restarting the patient's home regimen for hypertension.
4. Keeping the patient out of bed today.
5. Restarting the patient's statin therapy.
6. Placing peripherals and discontinuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
* Progression of septic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Cardiac complications
* Neurological complications
* Infection of the urinary tract
* Development of a pressure ulcer
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Acute kidney injury

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
