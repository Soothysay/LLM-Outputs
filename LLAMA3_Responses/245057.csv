   Fluid analysis / Other labs: Echo: The left atrium is dilated. There is
   moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   No vegetations seen (cannot definitively exclude).
   Imaging: There is interval significant increase in left lower lobe
   consolidation which
   appears to be progressing since [**2183-8-3**] and highly suspicious
   for developing left lower lobe pneumonia. The right middle lobe opacity
   is unchanged and may represent a focus of infection and/or atelectasis.
   The upper lungs are unremarkable. There is no evidence of failure.
   Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
   Microbiology: -lab error no positive BCx
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52 yo male with h/o Hep C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse who presented with
   coffee ground emesis and MS changes.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER/ANEMIA-pt presented with history of
   hematemasis and drop in hemocrit. However, etiology remains unclear
   especially with EGD yesterday that did not find upper GI source. Pt
   also has h/o diverticulosis but no BRBPR.   Overnight had a drop in Hct
   from 28.6-26.4. [**Month (only) 60**] be alternative source in setting of pancreatitis
   and fall in ED.
   -also required platlets to keep >50
   -Protonix IV BID per GI recs
   -start diet of clear and advance if tolerate, observe for aspiration
   and consult speech and swallow if suspected
   -q6 HCT and Platelet check; will transfuse for Hct <25, Platelets <50K
   -repeat CT abdomen with and without to find hematoma vs abscess
 FEVER-Pt still spiking fevers, likely due to pna that has progressed
   -continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc and Zosyn for picture c/w
   aspiration
   -TTE from yesterday-no vegetations, LVEF75%
   -CXR-as above shows progression of pneumonia in L base, will repeat
   CXR
   -f/u Urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures-try to get induced sputum today
   -continue surveillence cultures
   -records from [**Hospital1 1817**] show history of pancreatitis on discharge days
   before admission here
 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared
   -may have contributed to aspriation
   -IF MS does not improve will consider lactulose
   -fall precautions
 PANCYTOPENIA-pt w history of chronic thrombocytopenia, now with
   infection but no spike in WBC
   -confusing picture but may need to see heme as outpatient
 ODYNOPHAGIA-patient came in w dry mucous memranes and poor oral
   hygiene, DDx inlcudes phayngitis vs GERD vs poor oral hygiene
   - improved mouth care, humidified air seems
   -consider CT and then possibly ENT consult
   -no pain meds for now as patient has a history of abuse
 ETOH [**Name (NI) 3985**] Pt recently admitted for detox and currently denies ETOh
   use over past few weeks; however given strong h/o abuse will cover for
   possible withdrawal.
   -D/C CIWA scale
   -MVI, thiamine and folate
   -Restraints or 1:1 sitter if needed
   -Ativan prn
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-LFT abnl- Pt with mildly elevated amylase and
   lipase; has recent h/o pancreatitis. Also wtih elevated AST thought not
   surprising given ETOH abuse h/o but all elevated levels of liver
   function trending down.
   -Monitor for now
 CONJUNCTIVITIS-pt had R eye red and purulent at admission, now
   resolved with erythromycin opthal solution
   -willl follow
 HEPATITIS C- Followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3827**]; recently completed course of
   Ribavarin in IFN. Pt does not appear encephalopathic any more.
   -reportedly had cirrhosis, but does not look like it with HSM and no
   varices
   -Consider Lactulose if MS does not improve
HTN- Hold home anti-HTNs for now given acute bleeding risk

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ethanol abuse, and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with an aerosol-cooling device.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. His extremities are warm, with no cyanosis or clubbing. His skin is warm, with no rash.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.8-4.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0-8.0 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 52-45 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8-0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30-26 mEq/L
* Sodium (Na): 139-136 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.8-4.2 mEq/L
* Glucose: 107-90 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Interval significant increase in left lower lobe consolidation, highly suspicious for developing left lower lobe pneumonia.
* Computed Tomography (CT) abdomen: No evidence of failure, small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

The patient's medical history includes:

* Hepatitis C cirrhosis
* Ethanol abuse
* Pancreatitis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Anemia
* Chronic thrombocytopenia

The patient's medications include:

* Piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* MVI, thiamine, and folate

The patient's plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
* Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis
* Monitoring for pancreatitis and liver function
* Follow-up with hematology and gastroenterology services

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and multi-organ failure due to pneumonia and pancreatitis
* Bleeding complications due to gastrointestinal bleeding and coagulopathy
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver failure
* Pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess
* Pulmonary embolism due to DVT
* Aspiration pneumonia due to poor oral hygiene and swallowing dysfunction
* Nutritional deficiencies due to malnutrition and pancreatitis
* Renal failure due to sepsis and pancreatitis

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52 yo male with h/o Hep C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse who presented with
   coffee ground emesis and MS changes.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER/ANEMIA-pt presented with history of
   hematemasis and drop in hemocrit. However, etiology remains unclear
   especially with EGD yesterday that did not find upper GI source. Pt
   also has h/o diverticulosis but no BRBPR.   Overnight had a drop in Hct
   from 28.6-26.4. [**Month (only) 60**] be alternative source in setting of pancreatitis
   and fall in ED.
   -also required platlets to keep >50
   -Protonix IV BID per GI recs
   -start diet of clear and advance if tolerate, observe for aspiration
   and consult speech and swallow if suspected
   -q6 HCT and Platelet check; will transfuse for Hct <25, Platelets <50K
   -repeat CT abdomen with and without to find hematoma vs abscess
 FEVER-Pt still spiking fevers, likely due to pna that has progressed
   -continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc and Zosyn for picture c/w
   aspiration
   -TTE from yesterday-no vegetations, LVEF75%
   -CXR-as above shows progression of pneumonia in L base, will repeat
   CXR
   -f/u Urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures-try to get induced sputum today
   -continue surveillence cultures
   -records from [**Hospital1 1817**] show history of pancreatitis on discharge days
   before admission here
 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared
   -may have contributed to aspriation
   -IF MS does not improve will consider lactulose
   -fall precautions
 PANCYTOPENIA-pt w history of chronic thrombocytopenia, now with
   infection but no spike in WBC
   -confusing picture but may need to see heme as outpatient
 ODYNOPHAGIA-patient came in w dry mucous memranes and poor oral
   hygiene, DDx inlcudes phayngitis vs GERD vs poor oral hygiene
   - improved mouth care, humidified air seems
   -consider CT and then possibly ENT consult
   -no pain meds for now as patient has a history of abuse
 ETOH [**Name (NI) 3985**] Pt recently admitted for detox and currently denies ETOh
   use over past few weeks; however given strong h/o abuse will cover for
   possible withdrawal.
   -D/C CIWA scale
   -MVI, thiamine and folate
   -Restraints or 1:1 sitter if needed
   -Ativan prn
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-LFT abnl- Pt with mildly elevated amylase and
   lipase; has recent h/o pancreatitis. Also wtih elevated AST thought not
   surprising given ETOH abuse h/o but all elevated levels of liver
   function trending down.
   -Monitor for now
 CONJUNCTIVITIS-pt had R eye red and purulent at admission, now
   resolved with erythromycin opthal solution
   -willl follow
 HEPATITIS C- Followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3827**]; recently completed course of
   Ribavarin in IFN. Pt does not appear encephalopathic any more.
   -reportedly had cirrhosis, but does not look like it with HSM and no
   varices
   -Consider Lactulose if MS does not improve
HTN- Hold home anti-HTNs for now given acute bleeding risk

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ethanol abuse, and pancreatitis. He presented with coffee ground emesis, melena, and decreased hemoglobin, which is unclear in etiology. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of hematemesis and drop in hemocrit, but the etiology remains unclear. He has been treated with proton pump inhibitors and has been advised to start a clear diet with advancement if tolerated.
2. Fever: The patient has been spiking fevers, likely due to pneumonia that has progressed. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been advised to repeat chest X-rays.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis and has mildly elevated amylase and lipase levels. He is being monitored for now.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has completed a course of ribavarin and interferon, and his liver function tests are trending down.
5. Hypertension: The patient's home anti-hypertensive medications have been held due to the acute bleeding risk.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia and is now experiencing infection without a spike in white blood cell count. He may need to be seen by a hematology specialist as an outpatient.
7. Odynophagia: The patient has dry mucous membranes and poor oral hygiene, which may be contributing to his symptoms. He has been advised to improve his mouth care and humidified air has been provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may worsen, leading to further bleeding or complications.
2. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to further complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as abscess formation or necrosis.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient's Hepatitis C may progress, leading to further liver damage or complications.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen, leading to further bleeding or infection complications.
6. Aspiration: The patient's odynophagia may worsen, leading to further aspiration or respiratory complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care has been advised:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia.
2. Monitor for signs of bleeding or infection.
3. Start a clear diet with advancement if tolerated.
4. Improve mouth care and humidified air has been provided.
5. Consider lactulose if the patient's mental status does not improve.
6. Follow up with the patient's primary care physician and hematology specialist as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. No evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma.
   2. Worsening pneumonia at the left lung base with new foci of infection
   at
   the right lung base and bilateral parapneumonic effusions.
   3. Gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid in the setting of a
   gallstone raise concern for cholecystitis in the right clinical
   setting.
   [**8-6**] Sputum culture  contaminated with oropharyngeal flora
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 52 yo male with h/o Hep C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse who presented with
   coffee ground emesis and MS changes.
 ASPIRATION PNEUMONIAFEVER-Pt still spiking fevers, likely due to pna
   that has progressed
   -change Abx to Levoquin picture c/w aspiration, irritation of diaphragm
   likely causing hiccups
   -TTE from yesterday-no vegetations, LVEF75%
   -CXR-as above shows progression of pneumonia in L base, will repeat
   CXR
   -CT abd show progression of B/L pneumonia
   -f/u Urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures-try to get induced sputum today
   -continue surveillence cultures
   -records from [**Hospital1 1817**] show history of pancreatitis on discharge days
   before admission here
 ABDOMINAL PAIN-pt has h/o of pancreatitis with amylase/lipase
   trending down
   -will continue to monitor
   -no RUQ pain as CT Abd might suggest
   -mild diffuse tenderness on deep palpation
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER/ANEMIA-pt presented with history of
   hematemasis and drop in hemocrit. However, etiology remains unclear
   especially with EGD yesterday that did not find upper GI source except
   esophagitis. Pt also has h/o diverticulosis but no BRBPR.   Overnight
   had a drop in Hct from 28.6-27.1.
   -still with slow trend down in Hct, could be related to pancytopenia
   -also required platlets to keep >50
   -Protonix IV BID per GI recs
   -start diet of clear and advance if tolerate, observe for aspiration
   and consult speech and swallow if suspected
   -q6 HCT and Platelet check; will transfuse for Hct <25, Platelets <50K
   -repeat CT abdomen notc/w hematoma as source
 AMS-Pt came in with disorientation and garbled speech considered to
   be from withdrawal vs acute intoxication now improving
   -per [**Hospital1 1817**] records was discharged with Benzos and narcotics likely
   accounting for AMS since he has not received any here and has cleared
   -may have contributed to aspriation
   -IF MS does not improve will consider lactulose
   -fall precautions
 PANCYTOPENIA-pt w history of chronic thrombocytopenia, now with
   infection but no spike in WBC, and anemia
   -confusing picture but may need to see heme as outpatient
   -could be related to ribavarin treatment in past
 ODYNOPHAGIA-patient came in w dry mucous memranes and poor oral
   hygiene, DDx inlcudes phayngitis vs GERD vs poor oral hygiene
   - improved mouth care, humidified air seems
   -can be attributed to esophagitis, improved on PPI
   -no pain meds for now as patient has a history of abuse
 ETOH [**Name (NI) 3985**] Pt recently admitted for detox and currently denies ETOh
   use over past few weeks; however given strong h/o abuse will cover for
   possible withdrawal.
   -D/C CIWA scale
   -MVI, thiamine and folate
   -Restraints or 1:1 sitter if needed
   -Ativan prn
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE-LFT abnl- Pt with mildly elevated amylase and
   lipase; has recent h/o pancreatitis. Also wtih elevated AST thought not
   surprising given ETOH abuse h/o but all elevated levels of liver
   function trending down.
   -Monitor for now
 CONJUNCTIVITIS-pt had R eye red and purulent at admission, now
   resolved with erythromycin opthal solution
   -willl follow
 HEPATITIS C- Followed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 3827**]; recently completed course of
   Ribavarin in IFN. Pt does not appear encephalopathic any more.
   -reportedly had cirrhosis, but does not look like it with HSM and no
   varices
   -Consider Lactulose if MS does not improve
HTN- Hold home anti-HTNs for now given acute bleeding risk

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
