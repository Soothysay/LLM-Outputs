   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR after
   discussing case with surgery and monitoring her clinically
   - follow serial lactate (currently not elevated)
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 29
   - monitor serial Hct to confirm she is not actively bleeding
   - check hemolysis labs
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 29
   - monitor serial Hct to confirm she is not actively bleeding
   - check hemolysis labs
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted to the ICU after open cholecystectomy and transfer due to persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has tachypnea, requiring face mask oxygen, and was intubated due to tachypnea. The CXR suggests infection, and the patient is at risk for pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has decreased urine output, and the lab results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient is likely to have prerenal AKI, and IV fluids will be given to monitor urine output.
3. Sepsis: The patient has fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal laboratory results, which may indicate sepsis. The patient is being covered with antibiotics, and further monitoring is necessary.
4. Respiratory acidosis: The patient has a respiratory acidosis, which may be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation or decreased respiratory drive while on narcotics.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to narcotic pain medications, hypercarbic respiratory failure, or developing sepsis.
6. Pain control: The patient has severe abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs, which require close monitoring and management.
7. Anemia: The patient has a decreased Hct level, which may indicate active bleeding or hemolysis.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which requires close monitoring and management.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires continued levothyroxine therapy.
10. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient has OSA, which requires CPAP therapy at night if not intubated.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for coverage of potential infection
2. IV fluids for AKI
3. Narcotic pain medications with close monitoring for respiratory acidosis and altered mental status
4. Close monitoring of serial laboratory results, including ABGs, lactate, and urine output
5. Consideration of CT abdomen or surgical reevaluation
6. Avoidance of renally toxic medications
7. Monitoring for hypercarbic respiratory failure and consideration of CPAP or intubation
8. Close monitoring of pain control and management of abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain. However, in OR no abd
   source seen, also ERCP appeared normal. Bronch showed likely infection
   in RLL with edudative sections. Therefore, likely has aspiration PNA.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input, likely transfer to surgery today to SICU
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril. Renal failure improving today
   - may need to redose meds as renal function changes
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications,
   - now sedated
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation in addition to
   acute aspiration PNA. Was intubated on [**7-6**].
   - will ween FIO2 as tolerated, then wean PEEP
   - nebs PRN
   - abx of PNA as above
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 32.6 after transfusion. No sign
   of bleeding on ex-lap last night. Hemolysis labs are negative.
   - monitor serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] for bleeding
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain. However, in OR no abd
   source seen, also ERCP appeared normal. Bronch showed likely infection
   in RLL with edudative sections. Therefore, likely has aspiration PNA.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input, likely transfer to surgery today to SICU
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril. Renal failure improving today
   - may need to redose meds as renal function changes
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications,
   - now sedated
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation in addition to
   acute aspiration PNA. Was intubated on [**7-6**].
   - will ween FIO2 as tolerated, then wean PEEP
   - nebs PRN
   - abx of PNA as above
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 32.6 after transfusion. No sign
   of bleeding on ex-lap last night. Hemolysis labs are negative.
   - monitor serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] for bleeding
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted to the ICU after open cholecystectomy and transferred due to persistent post-operative pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. She is intubated and sedated, with a central line and arterial line in place. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and attention deficit disorder, and is currently being treated for acute renal failure, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory acidosis. She is also being monitored for anemia, bleeding, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and aspiration pneumonia is a significant concern. The patient's bronchial breath sounds bilaterally and CXR suggestive of infection increase the risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the patient is at risk of developing further renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.
4. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis is likely due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation and acute aspiration PNA. Weaning of FIO2 and PEEP, as well as treatment of aspiration PNA, is essential to improve respiratory status.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are decreasing, and monitoring of serial Hct levels is essential to detect early signs of bleeding.
6. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is high due to her anemia and recent surgery. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect early signs of bleeding.
7. Sepsis-Induced Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension suggest the possibility of sepsis-induced cardiac complications. Close monitoring of cardiac status and treatment of sepsis are essential to prevent further cardiac complications."

   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR after
   discussing case with surgery and monitoring her clinically
   - follow serial lactate (currently not elevated)
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR after
   discussing case with surgery and monitoring her clinically
   - follow serial lactate (currently not elevated)
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 29
   - monitor serial Hct to confirm she is not actively bleeding
   - check hemolysis labs
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall
   # FEN:  NPO; IV fluids as above
   # PPx:  subQ heparin; famotidine
   # Access:  PIVs; will likely need art line and central line
   # Code:  FULL (confirmed with HCP)
   # Comm:  with surgery ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 6619**]) and family (daughter [**Name (NI) 6620**]

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted to the ICU after open cholecystectomy and transferred due to persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. She has a fever of 101.1°F, tachypnea, and is intubated. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lipase, and decreased urine output. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and ADD, and is currently taking various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachypnea, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be caused by an abdominal source of infection or aspiration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be prerenal or due to sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased respiratory drive may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be caused by her narcotic pain medications, but could also be a sign of developing sepsis or hypercarbic respiratory failure.
5. Pain Management: The patient's severe abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs require careful pain management to avoid further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's decreased Hct and hemoglobin levels require close monitoring to confirm she is not actively bleeding.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires continued levothyroxine therapy.
8. OSA: The patient's OSA requires CPAP therapy at night if not intubated.
9. ADD: The patient's ADD requires hold on Adderall medication.
10. HTN: The patient's HTN requires hold on home BP meds for now.

Assessment and Plan:

* Cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now to address potential infection.
* Monitor serial abdominal exams and consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR.
* Follow serial lactate, urine, sputum, and blood cultures.
* Monitor urine output and consider IV fluids to address potential acute renal failure.
* Minimize narcotic medications to avoid hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Place A-line to monitor ABGs closely and consider CPAP vs intubation.
* Continue levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism.
* Hold Adderall medication for ADD.
* Hold home BP meds for now due to HTN.
* Continue CPAP therapy at night if not intubated for OSA."
