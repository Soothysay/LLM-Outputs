   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid for now
   - check phenytoin level in a.m.; most recent level 22.5; goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - continue insulin gtt
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   - maintain ventilatory support for now
   - will wean off once underlying seizure and hyperglycemia resolve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, and TIA, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a presep catheter, administration of antibiotics, and initiation of insulin therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is supported with a ventilator, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose, creatinine, and potassium, as well as a low albumin level. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but the differential shows a shift towards neutrophils.

The patient's physical examination is significant for soft, non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in the extremities. The patient's neurologic examination shows no focal deficits, and the patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's plan includes continued treatment of DKA, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient will continue to receive insulin therapy and will be monitored closely for signs of improvement. The patient will also continue to receive antibiotics and will have further evaluation with EEG and HSV PCR.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Hyperkalemia due to potassium supplementation
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation
* Sepsis due to uncontrolled infection
* Neurologic complications due to altered mental status and seizure activity
* Cardiovascular complications due to hypotension and tachycardia
* Renal complications due to acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalance
* Gastrointestinal complications due to stress ulcer and malnutrition."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid

   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - ISS, f/u lytes at 9:00
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and had hyperglycemia and glucosuria with a normal anion gap. The patient has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure, acute.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and insulin, and has undergone various laboratory tests, including blood cultures, urine cultures, and an electroencephalogram (EEG).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.8°C, HR 102 bpm, BP 108/67 mmHg, RR 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 10 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 25 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) 4.5 L/min.
* Fluid balance: Total input 998 mL, total output 290 mL, urine output 115 mL.
* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 40%.
* Laboratory results: Blood glucose 212 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.0 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) 288 K/uL, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1.

Potential medical complications:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is being managed with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement. However, there is a risk of recurrent DKA if the patient's blood glucose levels are not carefully monitored and managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and viral encephalitis, which increases her risk of infection. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, and she is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
4. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and has had a recent seizure. There is a risk of recurrent seizure if the patient's anticonvulsant therapy is not optimized.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored closely, and she is receiving regular insulin sliding scale therapy. However, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the patient's insulin therapy is not adjusted properly.
6. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving fluids to manage her DKA and respiratory failure. However, there is a risk of fluid overload if the patient's fluid status is not carefully monitored.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored closely, and she is receiving electrolyte replacement therapy. However, there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance if the patient's electrolyte levels are not carefully monitored and managed."

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 8hrs
 corrected level this am 25
   - check phenytoin level tomorrow am
   - EEG results pending
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   - F/U final read MRI. Prelim read- tiny subdural left parietal region
   without mass effect on the underlying brain. No evidence for acute
   ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 5)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          Pt currently doing well on PS 8, PEEP 5
   -          Attempt extubation today- will need to lighten sedation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes, seizure disorder, hypertension, patent foramen ovale, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) with a 3-4mm left parietal SDH on MRI
* Seizure disorder with a history of non-compliance with antiepileptic medication
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with hyperglycemia and glucosuria
* Respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, with a requirement for mechanical ventilation
* Altered mental status, likely due to seizure, DKA, and possible SDH

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Increased intracranial pressure and further neurological deterioration due to the SDH
* Seizure recurrence or status epilepticus due to non-compliance with antiepileptic medication or underlying conditions
* Worsening of DKA, potentially leading to acidosis, coma, or even death
* Respiratory failure exacerbation, potentially leading to ARDS or other pulmonary complications
* Infection, particularly urinary tract or respiratory tract infections, which could worsen the patient's condition
* Metabolic derangements, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which could exacerbate the patient's condition

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued phenytoin therapy to control seizures
* Monitoring of phenytoin levels and adjustment as necessary
* EEG results pending
* Seizure precautions and follow-up with neurology recommendations
* Treatment of DKA with insulin and fluid management
* Monitoring of respiratory status and potential extubation
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Close monitoring of the patient's condition and potential complications."

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid
   - check phenytoin level at 9:00. goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - ISS, f/u lytes at 9:00
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          wean vent settings now that underlying seizure and
   hyperglycemia appear resolved
   -          Attempt extubation today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient has the following conditions:

1. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH)
2. Seizure, without status epilepticus
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
4. Respiratory Failure, acute (not ARDS)

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. She has a 3-4mm L parietal SDH, which was revealed by MRI. The patient is receiving insulin, antibiotics, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T-max: 37.3°C
* T-current: 37.1°C
* HR: 100 bpm
* BP: 98/55 mmHg
* RR: 11 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.6-6.9 K/uL
* Hct: 28.5-26.3%
* Plt: 288-212 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7-0.6 mg/dL
* TCO2: 23 mEq/L
* Glucose: 80-151 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.7/41.6/1.1, ALT/AST: 11-27, Alk Phos/T Bili: 59/0.3, Differential-Neuts: 76.6%, Lymph: 19.4%, Mono: 2.9%, Eos: 1.0%, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, Ca++: 7.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 1.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Increased intracranial pressure due to SDH, which can lead to further neurological deterioration
* Seizure recurrence due to non-compliance with antiepileptic medication or underlying seizure disorder
* Hyperglycemic crisis due to DKA, which can lead to ketoacidosis, coma, and even death
* Respiratory failure due to altered mental status, which can lead to pneumonia, atelectasis, and other complications
* Infection due to altered mental status, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death
* Thromboembolic complications due to immobility and hypercoagulable state
* Nutritional deficiencies due to altered mental status and inability to eat

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing phenytoin 100 mg tid
* Checking phenytoin level at 9:00 AM with a goal of 15-20
* Performing an EEG
* Implementing seizure precautions
* Following up with neurology recommendations
* Managing hyperglycemia with insulin and aggressive NS resuscitation
* Ruling out infection with HSV PCR, blood cultures, and urine cultures
* Continuing empiric CTX, vanco, and acyclovir for now
* Weaning vent settings and attempting extubation today
* Monitoring for signs of DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Following up with neurology recommendations and ICU care plan."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:

   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 12 hrs

   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 8)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont D5NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.

   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap. The patient remains somnolent but interactive and responsive, with stable respiratory status.

The patient has undergone invasive ventilation, which was stopped on the 24th hour. She has been extubated and is being monitored closely. Her dilantin level has been adjusted, and her medication regimen has been modified to include fentanyl and versed.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Seizure disorder
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
3. Subdural hemorrhage (SDH)
4. Respiratory failure, acute
5. Altered mental status

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizure disorder and recent seizure episode increase the risk of future seizures.
2. DKA progression: The patient's DKA may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further metabolic derangements.
3. SDH expansion: The patient's SDH may expand or worsen if not monitored closely, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological deficits.
4. Respiratory failure exacerbation: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory compromise.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and recent seizure episode increase the risk of infection, particularly central nervous system infections such as meningitis or encephalitis.
6. Metabolic derangements: The patient's DKA and altered mental status may lead to further metabolic derangements, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Plan:

1. Continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 12 hrs to manage seizure disorder.
2. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust medication as needed.
3. Manage the patient's DKA with insulin therapy and close glucose monitoring.
