   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DKA: Increase above baseline on
   presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It
   slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. On admission to
   MICU, BS is elevated and there was concern for DKA in addition to
   uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Patient received IVF, bicarb, insulin drip and ultimately closed his
   Anion Gap (as much as could be expected in patient with CKD) by 7am
   today
   - Discontinue insulin gtt
 long acting insulin + sliding scale, will
   discuss this with [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - Will recheck serum electrolytes and anion gap this evening
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Patient no
   currently having diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - Advance patient
s diet as tolerated and encourage PO fluids
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - Follow-up on Cdiff studies
   # DM:  BS elevated with AG, concern initially  for DKA.
   - Will resume glargine and insulin sliding scale, discontinue insulin
   gtt per above
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] following
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and 5 liters in the MICU, but need to
   be careful due to renal function.
   - Social Work consult for coping with initiation of dialysis and
   chronic disease (DM1)
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and will start hemodialysis for patient today
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds yesterday. Was restarted on home
   medications but persistently hypertensive likely in setting of anxiety,
   significant volume overload from fluids yesterday and uremia, chronic
   kidney disease
   - Continue home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine, will add
   additional agents PRN
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for worsening renal failure and anion gap metabolic acidosis. He was found to have a high anion gap and was treated with intravenous fluids, bicarbonate, and insulin drip. His anion gap improved, and he was able to discontinue the insulin drip. He was also treated for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which were likely caused by viral gastroenteritis or gastroparesis. The patient's blood sugar levels were elevated, and he was treated with insulin and sliding scale insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient experienced an episode of hypertensive urgency with a blood pressure of 230/90 mmHg. This could lead to end-organ damage, including cardiac, renal, and cerebral damage.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood sugar levels were elevated, and he was treated with insulin and sliding scale insulin. DKA is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's CKD is likely to progress, and he may require dialysis in the future.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level was 20%, which is mildly below his baseline level. He was treated with iron supplements and was scheduled for blood transfusion if his hemoglobin level fell below 21%.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension was poorly controlled, and he required additional medications to control his blood pressure.
6. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient experienced nausea and vomiting, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be caused by a variety of conditions, including gastroparesis, pancreatitis, or bowel obstruction.
8. Infection: The patient was at risk of developing infections, particularly in his kidneys, due to his CKD and immunosuppressive therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his medical conditions to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DKA: Increase above baseline on
   presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It
   slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. On admission to
   MICU, BS is elevated and there was concern for DKA in addition to
   uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Patient received IVF, bicarb, insulin drip and ultimately closed his
   Anion Gap (as much as could be expected in patient with CKD) by 7am
   today
   - Discontinue insulin gtt
 long acting insulin + sliding scale, will
   discuss this with [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - Will recheck serum electrolytes and anion gap this evening
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Patient no
   currently having diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - Advance patient
s diet as tolerated and encourage PO fluids
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - Follow-up on Cdiff studies
   # DM:  BS elevated with AG, concern initially  for DKA.
   - Will resume glargine and insulin sliding scale, discontinue insulin
   gtt per above
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] following
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and 5 liters in the MICU, but need to
   be careful due to renal function.
   - Social Work consult for coping with initiation of dialysis and
   chronic disease (DM1)
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and will start hemodialysis for patient today
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds yesterday. Was restarted on home
   medications but persistently hypertensive likely in setting of anxiety,
   significant volume overload from fluids yesterday and uremia, chronic
   kidney disease
   - Continue home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine, will add
   additional agents PRN
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and gastroparesis. He was admitted to the MICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was found to have worsening renal failure and anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/72 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 89%. He is receiving insulin therapy, and his anion gap has improved from 21 to 14.3 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating worsening renal failure
* Elevated glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia
* Mild elevation of liver function tests (LFTs), possibly indicating liver dysfunction
* Normal lactate levels, ruling out lactic acidosis

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Flat affect
* Peripheral vascular insufficiency (right and left radial pulses not assessed)
* Skin not assessed
* Neurologic examination not performed

The patient's medical history includes:

* Hypertension, poorly controlled
* Type 1 diabetes, with a history of DKA
* Chronic kidney disease, with a baseline hemoglobin level of 25
* Gastroparesis, with a history of nausea and vomiting

The patient's current medications include:

* Insulin therapy, with a sliding scale and long-acting insulin
* Metoprolol, an anti-hypertensive medication
* Amlodipine, an anti-hypertensive medication
* Pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor
* Morphine, for pain control
* Zofran, for nausea and vomiting

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening renal failure, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease
* Hyperglycemia, potentially leading to DKA or other complications
* Hypertension, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications
* Gastroparesis, potentially leading to further nausea and vomiting
* Dehydration, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances or other complications

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuation of insulin therapy, with a sliding scale and long-acting insulin
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels and anion gap
* Administration of IV fluids, as needed
* Management of hypertension with metoprolol and amlodipine
* Monitoring of liver function tests and lactate levels
* Consideration of dialysis, if necessary
* Supportive care, including pain management and nausea and vomiting treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of severe nausea and vomiting. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, depression, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His current medications include insulin, metoprolol, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 143/72 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 89% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 233 K/uL and creatinine of 15.3 mg/dL, indicating worsening renal function. His hemoglobin is 8.0 g/dL, and his platelet count is 111 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 58 IU/L and aspartate transaminase (AST) of 27 IU/L.

The patient's fluid balance is 2,816 mL over the past 24 hours, with 2,166 mL of this being intravenous fluids. He has received 650 mL of blood products and 650 mL of urine output.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 89% on nasal cannula. His ABG results show a pH of 7.20, indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his inability to move or assess certain areas.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may require adjustments to his fluid management and medication regimen.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is not provided, but his insulin regimen may need to be adjusted to prevent hyperglycemia.
3. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.20, indicating respiratory acidosis. This may require adjustments to his respiratory support and oxygen therapy.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and differential may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is 2,816 mL over the past 24 hours, which may lead to fluid overload and increased risk of complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 143/72 mmHg, which may be a concern, especially in the context of his chronic kidney disease and potential fluid overload.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 111 K/uL, which may indicate thrombocytopenia. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat potential complications. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address his underlying conditions and improve his clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Pt does not
   appear fluid overloaded on exam. Not currently havind diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - NPO except meds overnight but likely transition to PO meds and diet
   today
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - will send c.diff and stool studies if diarrhea returns
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Increase above baseline on presentation
   probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It slightly improved
   s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. But now BS is elevated and there is
   concern for DKA inaddition to uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Trend anion gap
   - IVF as above
   - insulin gtt to tx DKA
 likely will discontinue this morning
   - recheck serum and urine for ketones
   # DM:  BS currently elevated with AG, concern for DKA.
   - Will place pt on insulin gtt and hold glargine for now
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] is aware
   - will monitor lytes Q4H
   - checking for ketones
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and getting more IVF currently to
   replace PO output, but need to be careful due to renal function.
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and would like pt to start HD later [**Last Name (LF) 1330**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] renal AVF
   is ready to use
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.
   - Supportive care as above
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds this AM.
   - Metoprolol 10mg IV q6h over night
   - Resume home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine if able (metop
   succinate changed to tartrate in case uptitration needed)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and gastroparesis, who was admitted to the ICU with worsening renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His vital signs are stable, but his anion gap metabolic acidosis has worsened, and he is at risk for DKA. He is receiving insulin drip therapy and IV fluids to manage his condition. His kidney function is being closely monitored, and he is expected to start hemodialysis soon.

Potential medical complications:

1. DKA: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is worsening, and he is at risk for DKA. Close monitoring of his blood sugar levels and insulin therapy is necessary to prevent DKA.
2. Uremic complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease is worsening, and he is at risk for uremic complications such as seizures, coma, and cardiovascular events.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastroparesis and diarrhea are putting him at risk for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines make him prone to infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and chronic kidney disease put him at risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's gastroparesis and diarrhea are putting him at risk for malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.
7. Hemodialysis complications: The patient is expected to start hemodialysis soon, and he may be at risk for complications such as access site bleeding, infection, and hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and worsening renal failure. The patient has a history of type I diabetes, depression, and chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has been stabilized with fluid resuscitation, and they are currently receiving insulin and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are still at risk for complications such as DKA, hypoglycemia, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. DKA: The patient's condition is still at risk for worsening DKA, which can lead to acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and even death if not managed properly.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin and other medications to manage their blood sugar levels, but they are still at risk for hypoglycemia, especially if their blood sugar levels drop too low.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to their chronic renal failure and the presence of a central line.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and they may require dialysis in the near future.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are still at risk for respiratory failure, especially if their underlying chronic lung disease worsens.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but they are still at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels closely and adjust their insulin dosing as needed to prevent hypoglycemia.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust their fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide respiratory support as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and provide cardiac support as needed.
5. Consider initiating dialysis in the near future to manage the patient's worsening renal failure.
6. Consider providing stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Consider providing DVT prophylaxis to prevent deep vein thrombosis."

   - q 1 hour FS
   - PM lytes, lactate
   - insulin gtt 2 units/hr
   - NS liter bolus
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] input
   # Abdominal Pain: Had spell of [**10-17**] abdominal pain likely related to
   his KFC meal aggravating his gastroparesis and resurgent hyperglycemia.
   Resolved with morphine. EKG normal.
   - Educate him on in-house only diet
   # Acute-on-chronic RF: Had first HD session [**2-20**], only 1 liter off.
   Will likely have 2 more sessions today and tomorrow.
   - touch base with HD to confirm schedule
   - Social Work consult for coping
   - Monitor Cr
   # Anemia: Hct 23 back near b/l. Likely [**2-9**] to CKD.
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. Persistently running SBPs 170-210 o/n, even
   while sleeping, despite several IV doses of Metoprolol and Hydralazine,
   and despite home meds Amlodipine 10 mg QD, Hydralazine 25 mg TID,
   Metoprolol 100 mg QD.
   - Increased Hydralazine dose to 50 mg TID, beginning this AM. Monitor
   response to that.

   abdominal pain and N/V/D c/w DKA.
   # DKA: He came off of insulin gtt yesterday, declined hospital diet all
   day (was ordered for diabetic/renal diet), then at midnight had large
   [**State 4755**] Fried Chicken meal brought in by friend. Hours later he
   developed hyperglycemia, nausea, abdominal pain. We chased his sugars
   this AM with sliding scale but then put him back on the drip, and
   ordered a liter of NS for hydration.
   - Urine ketones ordered
   - q 1 hour FS
   - PM lytes, lactate
   - insulin gtt 2 units/hr
   - NS liter bolus
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] input
   # Abdominal Pain: Had spell of [**10-17**] abdominal pain likely related to
   his KFC meal aggravating his gastroparesis and resurgent hyperglycemia.
   Resolved with morphine. EKG normal.
   - Educate him on in-house only diet
   # Acute-on-chronic RF: Had first HD session [**2-20**], only 1 liter off.
   Will likely have 2 more sessions today and tomorrow.
   - touch base with HD to confirm schedule
   - Social Work consult for coping
   - Monitor Cr
   # Anemia: Hct 23 back near b/l. Likely [**2-9**] to CKD.
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. Persistently running SBPs 170-210 o/n, even
   while sleeping, despite several IV doses of Metoprolol and Hydralazine,
   and despite home meds Amlodipine 10 mg QD, Hydralazine 25 mg TID,
   Metoprolol 100 mg QD.
   - Increased Hydralazine dose to 50 mg TID, beginning this AM. Monitor
   response to that.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, a 32-year-old male, is in the ICU due to hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting, likely related to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was previously on insulin therapy, but it was discontinued, and he had a large Fried Chicken meal brought in by a friend, which triggered his hyperglycemia and abdominal pain. He was given morphine for pain relief and is currently on an insulin drip and a liter of normal saline for hydration.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 1, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He has been experiencing abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, which is likely related to his gastroparesis and resurgent hyperglycemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose: 436 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1c: 11.5 mg/dL
* Serum creatinine: 15.3 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 20.8%
* Platelet count: 90 K/uL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 95 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 201/99 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* No edema
* No murmur on cardiovascular examination

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with hyperglycemia and ketosis
* Hypertension, which is poorly controlled despite multiple medications
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with elevated serum creatinine
* Gastroparesis with abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting
* Anemia with a hematocrit of 23%

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Insulin drip and sliding scale to manage hyperglycemia
* Normal saline bolus and hydration to manage dehydration
* Monitoring of urine ketones and serum glucose
* Pain management with morphine as needed
* Education on in-house diet and medication regimen
* Social work consult for coping with chronic illness
* Monitoring of creatinine and hematocrit levels
* Increased dose of Hydralazine to 50 mg TID to manage hypertension
* Further evaluation and management of gastroparesis and CKD."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DKA: Increase above baseline on
   presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It
   slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. On admission to
   MICU, BS is elevated and there was concern for DKA in addition to
   uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Patient received IVF, bicarb, insulin drip and ultimately closed his
   Anion Gap (as much as could be expected in patient with CKD) by 7am
   today
   - Discontinue insulin gtt
 long acting insulin + sliding scale, will
   discuss this with [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - Will recheck serum electrolytes and anion gap this evening
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Patient no
   currently having diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - Advance patient
s diet as tolerated and encourage PO fluids
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - Follow-up on Cdiff studies
   # DM:  BS elevated with AG, concern initially  for DKA.
   - Will resume glargine and insulin sliding scale, discontinue insulin
   gtt per above
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] following
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and 5 liters in the MICU, but need to
   be careful due to renal function.
   - Social Work consult for coping with initiation of dialysis and
   chronic disease (DM1)
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and will start hemodialysis for patient today
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds yesterday. Was restarted on home
   medications but persistently hypertensive likely in setting of anxiety,
   significant volume overload from fluids yesterday and uremia, chronic
   kidney disease
   - Continue home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine, will add
   additional agents PRN
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DKA: Increase above baseline on
   presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It
   slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. On admission to
   MICU, BS is elevated and there was concern for DKA in addition to
   uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Patient received IVF, bicarb, insulin drip and ultimately closed his
   Anion Gap (as much as could be expected in patient with CKD) by 7am
   today
   - Discontinue insulin gtt
 long acting insulin + sliding scale, will
   discuss this with [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - Will recheck serum electrolytes and anion gap this evening
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Patient no
   currently having diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - Advance patient
s diet as tolerated and encourage PO fluids
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - Follow-up on Cdiff studies
   # DM:  BS elevated with AG, concern initially  for DKA.
   - Will resume glargine and insulin sliding scale, discontinue insulin
   gtt per above
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] following
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and 5 liters in the MICU, but need to
   be careful due to renal function.
   - Social Work consult for coping with initiation of dialysis and
   chronic disease (DM1)
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and will start hemodialysis for patient today
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds yesterday. Was restarted on home
   medications but persistently hypertensive likely in setting of anxiety,
   significant volume overload from fluids yesterday and uremia, chronic
   kidney disease
   - Continue home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine, will add
   additional agents PRN
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.

Summary:

The patient, a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 1, chronic kidney disease, and gastroparesis, is admitted to the ICU with worsening renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and concern for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His blood sugar is elevated, and he has a normal lactate level. He has received IV fluids, bicarbonate, and insulin drip, which has improved his anion gap metabolic acidosis. His medications include long-acting insulin, sliding scale insulin, metoprolol, and amlodipine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. DKA: The patient's blood sugar is elevated, and he has a history of diabetes type 1. DKA is a potential complication, especially in the setting of dehydration and chronic kidney disease.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease has worsened, and he is at risk for further decline in renal function.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which can be a concern in the setting of chronic kidney disease and the use of medications that can affect potassium levels.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which can be a concern in the setting of chronic kidney disease and the use of medications that can affect calcium levels.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is mildly below baseline, which can be a concern in the setting of chronic kidney disease and the use of medications that can affect hemoglobin levels.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, which can be a concern in the setting of chronic kidney disease and the use of medications that can affect blood pressure.
7. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which can be a concern in the setting of chronic kidney disease and the use of medications that can affect heart rate.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be related to his chronic kidney disease, gastroparesis, or other underlying conditions.
9. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
10. Hemodialysis: The patient will require hemodialysis, which can be a challenging procedure in the setting of chronic kidney disease and other underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), renal failure, and hypertension. The patient's condition has been stabilized, and she is receiving dialysis. The note highlights several key points:

1. The patient's blood sugar levels have been controlled with an insulin drip, and her hypertension has been managed with anti-HTN medications.
2. The patient's abdominal pain is chronic, and her abdominal examination is normal.
3. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and her SpO2 levels are stable at 93%.
4. The patient's neurological examination is normal, except for her depressed affect.
5. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, indicating renal failure.
6. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs, including a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 180/94 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin drip may lead to hypoglycemia if not monitored and adjusted properly.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or renal failure.
3. Renal failure progression: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed with dialysis and medication.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to DKA and renal failure may increase her risk of developing infections, such as sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to DKA or underlying gastroparesis, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and renal failure may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, who is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 94 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 180/94 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) type I, and the girlfriend brought in a meal around midnight, which led to worsening glycemic control. The patient required restart of insulin gtt for glycemic control after the meal.

The patient also has a history of depression, and the note mentions a depressed affect.

The patient has been diagnosed with DKA, and the gap at baseline is approximately 20. The underlying inc gap is due to renal failure, but it should be improving with the initiation of dialysis.

The patient has been treated with hydralazine for hypertension, and the blood pressure is being closely monitored.

The patient has chronic renal failure, and an AV fistula has been placed. Dialysis was initiated yesterday and was tolerated well.

The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which has improved significantly. The cause of the nausea and vomiting is unclear, but it may be related to DKA or underlying gastroparesis.

The patient also has a history of diarrhea, which has resolved.

The patient's lab results show the following:

* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 90 K/uL
* Creatinine: 15.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 436 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 11.5 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Chloride: 100 mEq/L
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL
* Albumin: 23.0%

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Diabetes mellitus (DM) type I
* Depression
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Hypertension, benign
* Chronic renal failure
* Nausea/vomiting
* Diarrhea

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Hyperglycemia and its associated complications, such as ketoacidosis
* Hypoglycemia and its associated complications, such as seizures and coma
* Hypertensive crisis
* Renal failure and its associated complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
* Depression and its associated complications, such as suicidal ideation and behavior
* Gastroparesis and its associated complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and malnutrition
* DKA and its associated complications, such as coma, seizures, and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and gastroparesis, admitted to the ICU for work-up and treatment of acute-on-chronic renal failure. He is currently receiving insulin sliding scale and fixed dose insulin, and is being monitored for hyperglycemia. He experienced a spell of abdominal pain likely related to his gastroparesis and resurgent hyperglycemia, which resolved with morphine. He is also being treated for hypertension, anemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with values ranging from 44 to 436 mg/dL. This may lead to complications such as DKA, which the patient has already experienced.
2. Gastroparesis: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting may be related to his gastroparesis, which can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress if not properly managed, leading to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications if not properly controlled.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient's depression and ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to decreased adherence to treatment plans and increased risk of complications.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, as he is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and drains make him at risk for infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure, who is currently undergoing hemodialysis. The patient has a history of type I diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/81 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings. The patient's abdominal examination is notable for soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and the extremities show no evidence of edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing renal failure, with a creatinine level of 15.3 mg/dL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a range of 44-436 mg/dL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 58 U/L and AST of 27 U/L.

The patient's medications include furosemide, morphine sulfate, dextrose 50%, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. The patient is also receiving insulin therapy, which was transitioned from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they are undergoing hemodialysis. Further deterioration in renal function could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and they are receiving insulin therapy. Hypoglycemia could occur if the patient's insulin dose is not adjusted appropriately.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and chronic renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting could lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and chronic renal failure increase their risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of depression and the potential for electrolyte imbalances or other complications could lead to neurological symptoms, such as seizures or altered mental status.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing medical issues, it is essential to continue close monitoring and adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, a 47-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU for chronic renal failure, type I diabetes, hypertension, and depression. The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Upset regarding starting dialysis without breakfast
* High blood pressure (SBP > 190) requiring anti-HTN medication
* Abdominal pain with EKG and morphine administration
* Blood sugar levels ranging from 436 to 130s, requiring insulin and glucose drip
* Refusal of calcium capsules due to size
* Renal recommendations including Metoprolol 100mg, no extra IVF, and HD tomorrow
* C. Diff sent for testing

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm
* Blood pressure: 167/92 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and lab results.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 8.1, 6.0, 7.1, 5.4, 6.2, and 5.3
* Hct: 20.8, 21.3, 23.9, 23.0, 23.1, and 22.5
* Plt: 90, 206, and 180
* Cr: 15.3, 15.0, 14.6, 13.0, 14.3, 14.5, 11.5, 11.8, 11.6, and 11.5
* Glucose: 4, 80, 134, 436, 169, 98, and 44
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 11.0/24.0/0.9, ALT / AST: 58/27, Alk Phos / T Bili: 76/0.7, Amylase / Lipase: /59, Differential-Neuts: 68.5%, Lymph: 24.7%, Mono: 5.3%, Eos: 1.1%, Lactic Acid: 0.6 mmol/L, LDH: 312 IU/L, Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 4.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions and treatment include:

* Hypoglycemia due to insulin and glucose drip
* Hypertension due to anti-HTN medication
* Abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting due to renal failure and treatment
* Infection due to C. Diff and other potential bacterial or viral infections
* Bleeding due to platelet count and coagulation factors
* Electrolyte imbalance due to kidney failure and treatment
* Respiratory complications due to chronic kidney disease and potential respiratory failure

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   32M with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in work-up for HD, p/w
   abdominal pain and N/V/D c/w DKA.
   # DKA: He came off of insulin gtt yesterday morning (second time),
   declined hospital diet all day (was ordered for diabetic/renal diet),
   then tried to have girlfriend order [**Name2 (NI) 11622**]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs, patient now
   on fixed dose and insulin sliding scale and encouraging patient to carb
   count and self administer insulin for more autonomy
   - Social work to see patient for poor coping with disease
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] input
   - Given low blood sugar this morning and then BS350+, will recheck
   fingersticks closely this afternoon prior to possible call out
   # Abdominal Pain: Had spell of [**10-17**] abdominal pain likely related to
   his KFC meal aggravating his gastroparesis and resurgent hyperglycemia.
   Resolved with morphine. EKG normal.
   - Nutrition consulted to educate him on appropriate diet
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute-on-chronic RF: Had first HD session [**2-20**], only 1 liter off.
   Will have 2 more sessions today and tomorrow.
   - touch base with HD to confirm schedule
   - Social Work consult for coping per above
   - Monitor Cr
   # Anemia: Hct 23 back near b/l. Likely [**2-9**] to CKD.
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. Slightly improved today on new regimen (SBPs
   140-170s). Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (per renal recs), Amlodipine 10mg
   daily, Hydralazine 50 mg TID

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with hypertension, type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and gastroparesis, admitted for hemodialysis (HD) and evaluation of acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were likely related to his KFC meal and gastroparesis. He has also had episodes of hyperglycemia and was started on insulin sliding scale and fixed dose glargine. He has been non-compliant with his diet and has been refusing calcium supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to non-compliance with insulin regimen and diet.
2. Acute-on-chronic renal failure (ARF) exacerbating CKD.
3. Gastroparesis worsening abdominal pain and nausea.
4. Hyperglycemia leading to further complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and increased risk of infections.
5. Hypertension poorly controlled, increasing risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Anemia due to CKD, potentially worsening fatigue, weakness, and decreased quality of life.
7. Ineffective coping mechanisms, potentially leading to depression, anxiety, and poor adherence to treatment plans.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin regimen as needed.
2. Encourage patient to adhere to diabetic and renal diet.
3. Provide education on gastroparesis and its management.
4. Monitor for signs of ARF and adjust HD schedule accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Consider iron supplementation for anemia.
7. Provide social work consultation for coping with chronic illness and depression.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of DKA and ARF and adjust treatment plans accordingly."
