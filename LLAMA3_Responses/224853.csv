   1. Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. Note

   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per report patient delerius this morning.
   Given that he was only out of the hospital for several hours, this was
   most likely due to intoxication rather than ETOH withdrawl(urine and
   serum tox o/w negative.  However, the patient also has history of
   seizure and CVA w/known PFO (not anticoagulated) and transaminitis
   which could all cause AMS.  CVA less likely  as his neuro exam is
   non-focal except for mildly deficient strength in his left arm which
   chronic.  Seizure also less likely to be responsible for entire picture
   as would expect patient's delirium to have resolved.
   -CIWA scale with Ativan given LFT abnormalities
   -Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   -f/u final read of head CT given
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission
   -Neuro Consult in AM
   -Check LFTs
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year, associated occasionally with lymphopenia, though now just
   thrombocytopenia.  Most likely related to ETOH, as no apparent
   medication effect temporally.  Also unlikely HIT/heparin antibodies as
   not temporally related to admissions but need to assess further when he
   actually received heparin products.
   -daily plt
   -pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin
   .
   # Transaminitis:During previous admission, LFTs trended down when
   patient not drinking, simvastatin held.  Hep serologies are negative,
   HIV negative, RUQ U/S with fatty infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin.
   -check LFTs today, if trending down most likely [**3-13**] simvastatin
   -if trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Patient
   denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
   -recheck Lipase
   -NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending
   down.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so ? volume depletion:
   -bolus NS
   -125 cc/hr IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO: Patient seen by cardiology in [**Month (only) **], and they
   recommended full dose aspirin but no further intervention unless
   patient has a second stroke.
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.  Patient
   without complain of arm pain today.
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: The patient is delirious, with a possible cause being intoxication rather than ETOH withdrawal, given the negative urine and serum tox results. However, the patient has a history of seizure and CVA with a known PFO, which could also cause altered mental status.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been intermittently thrombocytopenic over the last year, possibly related to ETOH use.
* Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are elevated, with a possible cause being ETOH use or medication effect.
* Increased Lipase: The patient's lipase level is elevated, with a possible cause being pancreatitis or medication effect.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawal, but the patient's dry mouth suggests possible volume depletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening of altered mental status: The patient's delirium could worsen, potentially leading to further complications such as falls, injuries, or respiratory compromise.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia could increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if he is taking anticoagulant medications.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase level suggests possible pancreatitis, which could worsen if left untreated.
* Volume depletion: The patient's tachycardia and dry mouth suggest possible volume depletion, which could lead to further complications such as hypotension, shock, or organ failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* CIWA scale with Ativan given for LFT abnormalities
* Thiamine, Folate, MVI
* Follow-up final read of head CT
* Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous admission
* Neuro consult in the morning
* Check LFTs
* If the patient worsens or develops focal neurologic signs, consider MRI head.
* Daily plt count
* Pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin products
* Hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin
* Check LFTs today, if trending down most likely due to simvastatin
* If trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
* Recheck Lipase
* NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending down
* Bolus NS
* 125 cc/hr IVF
* EKG when patient calm"

   1. Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. Note
   that coexisting forms of hepatic disease such as cirrhosis are not
   excluded.
   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  However, the
   patient also has history of seizure and CVA w/known PFO (not
   anticoagulated) and transaminitis which could all cause AMS.  CVA less
   likely  as his neuro exam is non-focal except for mildly deficient
   strength in his left arm which chronic.  Seizure also less likely to be
   responsible for entire picture as would expect patient's delirium to
   have resolved.
   -CIWA scale with Ativan given LFT abnormalities
   -Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   -f/u final read of head CT given
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission
   -Neuro Consult in AM
   -Check LFTs
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year, associated occasionally with lymphopenia, though now just
   thrombocytopenia.  Most likely related to ETOH, as no apparent
   medication effect temporally.  Also unlikely HIT/heparin antibodies as
   not temporally related to admissions but need to assess further when he
   actually received heparin products.
   -daily plt
   -pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin
   .
   # Transaminitis:During previous admission, LFTs trended down when
   patient not drinking, simvastatin held.  Hep serologies are negative,
   HIV negative, RUQ U/S with fatty infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin.
   -check LFTs today, if trending down most likely [**3-13**] simvastatin
   -if trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Patient
   denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
   -recheck Lipase
   -NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending
   down.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so ? volume depletion:
   -bolus NS
   -125 cc/hr IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO: Patient seen by cardiology in [**Month (only) **], and they
   recommended full dose aspirin but no further intervention unless
   patient has a second stroke.
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.  Patient
   without complain of arm pain today.
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to ethanol withdrawal, but the possibility of seizure, stroke, or transaminitis cannot be ruled out. Monitoring of the patient's neurological status and potential complications is crucial.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's intermittent thrombocytopenia may be related to ethanol use, and further investigation into the timing of heparin products is necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) may be trending down, but the possibility of medication effect or continued ethanol use cannot be ruled out. Monitoring of LFTs and holding medications that may exacerbate the condition are necessary.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, and rechecking lipase levels and NPO status are necessary.
5. Volume depletion: The patient's tachycardia may be related to agitation or ethanol withdrawal, but the possibility of volume depletion cannot be ruled out. Bolus normal saline and IV fluids are necessary to ensure adequate hydration.
6. PFO: The patient's history of patent foramen ovale (PFO) may increase the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, and further evaluation and potential intervention may be necessary.
7. Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: The patient's history of a non-displaced fracture may increase the risk of complications, such as nerve damage or infection.
8. Pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis: The patient's history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis may increase the risk of recurrence or complications, such as sepsis or osteomyelitis.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of their neurological, hematological, and liver function status. Further evaluation and potential interventions, such as neurology consultation, thrombocytopenia investigation, and medication adjustments, are necessary to ensure the patient's clinical improvement and prevent potential complications."

   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with Ativan IV PRN for now, will consider
   switching to PO Valium longer coverage
   -f/u final read of head CT, CT C-spine
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission, however Neuro saw pt this AM and will return with final recs
   regarding this meds and doses
   -f/u Neuro recs: current symptoms not liely from h/o of stroke, agree
   with treatment of ETOH withdrawal, Keppra can be given IV if PO not
   tolerated
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.  HIT also on diff however
   unlikely bc not correlating to Heparin exposure and clinically no signs
   of clotting, etc.
   -monitor daily plt
   -SC heparin for DVT ppx initially held, however will start today
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to immobilization or injury from ETOH
   abuse/withdrawal.  Hypothyroidism is a possible cause as well, however
   TSH wnl recently.
   - trend CK
   - continue aggressive hydration with IVF
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -order viral HCV load and consider liver c/s or give pt outpt f/u
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so could also be volume depletion.
   -continue IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.

   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.

   abuse/withdrawal.  Hypothyroidism is a possible cause as well, however
   TSH wnl recently.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU for now pending improvement of ETOH withdrawal<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Altered mental status: likely due to ETOH withdrawal, seizure, or stroke, but stroke is unlikely due to intact neuro exam except for chronic weakness in the left arm.
* Thrombocytopenia: intermittent and likely related to ETOH abuse.
* Elevated CK: likely due to immobilization or injury from ETOH abuse/withdrawal or hypothyroidism.
* Transaminitis: likely due to ETOH abuse, and the patient is HCV positive.
* Increased lipase: currently resolved.
* Tachycardia: likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawal or volume depletion.
* History of PFO: stable.
* Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: stable and not complaining of pain.
* History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: completed a 6-week course of Vanco and currently stable.

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Keppra: 500mg PO q12h, increased to 1000mg PO q12h tomorrow.
* Lamictal: 200mg PO qhs.
* Benzo: PRN.
* Ativan: IV PRN q2h.
* Zyprexa: 5mg PO qhs.
* Haloperidol: 0.5mg PO q12h.
* Pantoprazole: 40mg PO q12h.
* Heparin: 5000 units SQ q12h.
* Protonix: 40mg PO q12h.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 6.1
* Hct: 33.5
* Plt: 89
* Cr: 0.9
* Glucose: 88
* ALT: 289
* AST: 281
* Alk Phos: 55
* TBili: 0.8
* Albumin: 4.3
* LDH: 454

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.2°C
* Tcurrent: 36.8°C
* HR: 97 bpm
* BP: 132/80 mmHg
* RR: 15 insp/min
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: in 4pt restraints, NAD.
* HEENT: several small abrasions on the face, no scalp tenderness, sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear.
* Lungs: CTAB, no wheezes, rales, ronchi.
* CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs.
* Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
* GU: Foley in place.
* Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue CIWA scale with Ativan IV PRN.
* F/u final read of head CT and CT C-spine.
* Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous admission.
* Monitor daily plt.
* SC heparin for DVT ppx initially held, but will start today.
* Trend CK.
* Continue aggressive hydration with IVF.
* Hold Remeron and Simvastatin for now.
* Check daily LFTs.
* Order viral HCV load and consider liver c/s or give pt outpt f/u.
* Continue full dose aspirin.
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of ETOH withdrawal symptoms.
* Development of focal neurologic signs.
* Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding.
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.
* Liver damage due to transaminitis.
* Pancreatitis due to increased lipase levels.
* Hypothyroidism due to elevated TSH levels.
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or VAP.
* Cardiovascular complications due to tachycardia and hypertension.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient, a 47-year-old male, was recently hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal, seizures, and transaminitis. He was readmitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, elevated CK, transaminitis, and a non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius. He is currently being managed with Keppra, lamictal, and benzo for seizure control, CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal, and prophylactic heparin for DVT.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizure control:** The patient's seizure history and current medication regimen (Keppra, lamictal, and benzo) may lead to complications such as seizure recurrence, increased risk of falls, or medication side effects.
2. **Alcohol withdrawal:** The patient's CIWA scale may indicate ongoing alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as delirium tremens, hallucinations, or seizures.
3. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's history of thrombocytopenia may lead to complications such as bleeding or bruising, especially with concurrent use of anticoagulant medications.
4. **Elevated CK:** The patient's elevated CK levels may indicate ongoing muscle damage or injury, which can lead to complications such as rhabdomyolysis or muscle weakness.
5. **Transaminitis:** The patient's transaminitis may indicate ongoing liver damage or inflammation, which can lead to complications such as jaundice, coagulopathy, or liver failure.
6. **Infection:** The patient's history of pyomyositis and clavicular osteo may lead to complications such as recurrent infection or sepsis.
7. **Pulmonary complications:** The patient's respiratory status, including his oxygen saturation and ABG results, may indicate ongoing respiratory compromise or complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
8. **Cardiovascular complications:** The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may indicate ongoing cardiovascular instability or complications such as hypertension, hypotension, or arrhythmias.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure control and adjust medication regimens as necessary.
2. Closely monitor the patient's CIWA scale and adjust treatment accordingly to manage ongoing alcohol withdrawal.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk, and adjust anticoagulant medications as necessary.
4. Trend the patient's CK levels and monitor for signs of rhabdomyolysis or muscle weakness.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment accordingly to manage ongoing transaminitis.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment accordingly to manage ongoing cardiovascular instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -per Neuro: increase keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont lamictal at current
   dose of 200mg daily and f/u level from [**10-20**]. ativan IV prn seizure >5
   min or seizure cluster. avoid medications that may reduce his seizure
   threshold (i.e., fluoroquinolones, flagyl, antipsychotics). would
   prefer zyprexa or seroquel over halodol if needed for agitation.
   - neuro made an outpatient appt for pt on [**11-24**] at 1:30pm
   - f/u any new Neuro recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.
   -monitor daily plt and any signs of acute bleeding
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to injury/ETOH.  Hypothyroidism is a possible
   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - CK trending down
   - continue hydration with IVF PRN
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -pt to f/u with liver as outpatient
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain currently
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the ICU with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is:

* Altered mental status, likely due to ethanol withdrawal
* Thrombocytopenia, likely related to ethanol abuse
* Elevated CK, likely due to ethanol-induced muscle damage or hypothyroidism
* Transaminitis, likely due to ethanol abuse and HCV positivity
* Increased lipase, currently resolved
* Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius, stable
* History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis, currently stable
* History of PFO, stable

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Seizures: the patient has a history of seizures and is currently on Keppra and Lamictal, but the risk of seizures is still present.
* Bleeding: the patient has thrombocytopenia and is at risk of bleeding.
* Infection: the patient has a history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis and is at risk of developing an infection.
* Pancreatitis: the patient has a history of pancreatitis and is at risk of developing it again.
* Liver damage: the patient has transaminitis and is at risk of developing liver damage.
* Respiratory failure: the patient is on oxygen therapy and is at risk of developing respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN
* Increasing Keppra to 1000mg and continuing Lamictal at current dose
* Monitoring daily platelet count and signs of acute bleeding
* Continuing hydration with IVF PRN
* Holding Remeron and Simvastatin for now
* Checking daily LFTs
* Following up with liver specialist as outpatient
* Continuing full dose aspirin
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotics as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -per Neuro: increase keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont lamictal at current
   dose of 200mg daily and f/u level from [**10-20**]. ativan IV prn seizure >5
   min or seizure cluster. avoid medications that may reduce his seizure
   threshold (i.e., fluoroquinolones, flagyl, antipsychotics). would
   prefer zyprexa or seroquel over halodol if needed for agitation.
   - neuro made an outpatient appt for pt on [**11-24**] at 1:30pm
   - f/u any new Neuro recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.
   -monitor daily plt and any signs of acute bleeding
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to injury/ETOH.  Hypothyroidism is a possible
   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - CK trending down
   - continue hydration with IVF PRN
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -pt to f/u with liver as outpatient
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain currently
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the ICU with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of seizures, stroke, and ETOH abuse. He is currently being treated for ETOH withdrawal with CIWA scale, Ativan IV PRN, and Keppra. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, elevated CK, transaminitis, and increased lipase. He has a history of PFO, non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius, and pyomyositis/clavicular osteo.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizures and current treatment with Keppra and Ativan IV PRN make seizure recurrence a potential complication.
2. Infection: The patient's history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo and current treatment with antibiotics make infection a potential complication.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of ETOH abuse make bleeding a potential complication.
4. Liver damage: The patient's transaminitis and history of ETOH abuse make liver damage a potential complication.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatitis and current treatment with antibiotics make pancreatitis a potential complication.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and current treatment with oxygen therapy make respiratory failure a potential complication.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of stroke and current treatment with anticoagulants make cardiac complications a potential complication.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of pancreatitis and current treatment with antibiotics make gastrointestinal complications a potential complication.
9. Renal failure: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and current treatment with antibiotics make renal failure a potential complication.
10. Sepsis: The patient's history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo and current treatment with antibiotics make sepsis a potential complication."

   -Continue with Thiamine/Folate
   -Continue with CIWA scale guided valium dosing
   -will have to clarify any desire for detox and systematic approach to
   discontinuation of EtOH abuse.
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   Patient with signfiicant seizure disorder outside of EtOH withdrawl
   -Continue with seizure meds as defined by neurology consult service

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo patient with history of EtOH abuse and EtOH withdrawl as well as
   an independent history of seizure disorder now admitted with acute
   intoxication and has been supported through withdrawl with CIWA scale
   guided dosing of Valium with better response seen to Valium than Ativan
   interestingly.
   1) ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)-
   -Continue with Thiamine/Folate
   -Continue with CIWA scale guided valium dosing
   -will have to clarify any desire for detox and systematic approach to
   discontinuation of EtOH abuse.
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   Patient with signfiicant seizure disorder outside of EtOH withdrawl
   -Continue with seizure meds as defined by neurology consult service
   (Lamictal/Keppra)

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute intoxication and ethanol withdrawal. He has a history of ethanol abuse and seizure disorder. He has been supported through withdrawal with CIWA scale-guided dosing of Valium, with a better response seen to Valium than Ativan. His mental status has improved, and his heart rate and blood pressure have decreased. However, he has mild oliguria and decreased creatine kinase (CK) levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is still receiving seizure medications. However, the patient's seizure disorder is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of seizure recurrence.
2. Delirium: The patient is at risk for delirium due to ethanol withdrawal and may require increased monitoring and sedation.
3. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has mild oliguria, which may indicate a fluid imbalance. Close monitoring of his fluid status is necessary to prevent complications such as hypovolemia or pulmonary edema.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers, bleeding, or pancreatitis due to ethanol withdrawal and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have decreased, which may indicate a cardiovascular complication such as hypotension or arrhythmia.
7. Renal complications: The patient's mild oliguria may indicate a renal complication such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizure disorder and ethanol withdrawal may increase his risk for neurological complications such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or encephalopathy."
