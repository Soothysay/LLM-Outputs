   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE. Symptoms and
   oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Patient with crackles and JVD
   on exam, although no dependent edema. The dose of levofloxacin she
   received in the ED will provide adequate coverage until tomorrow, given
   her degree of renal insufficiency.
   - IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider consulting cardiac surgery

   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine currently at recent baseline.
   During the previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to
   rise after she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level.
   She had been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound
   was unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of kidney transplant, coronary artery disease, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the ICU with acute onset shortness of breath and hypotension. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 147/43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She has bibasilar crackles on lung exam and a small ulceration on her left lower extremity.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and hypotension may be indicative of worsening heart failure. Further management may include IV diuresis, medication adjustments, and consideration of consulting cardiac surgery.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and hypotension may also be indicative of a pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation may include a D-dimer test and imaging studies.
3. Sepsis: The patient's recent septic arthritis of her left ankle and current symptoms of shortness of breath and hypotension may indicate sepsis. Further evaluation may include blood cultures and imaging studies.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased, which may be indicative of renal failure. Further management may include adjusting diuretic medications and considering dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is at baseline, but may be at risk for further decline due to ongoing bleeding or other factors. Further evaluation may include daily hematocrit monitoring and consideration of transfusions.
6. Infection: The patient's recent septic arthritis and current symptoms of shortness of breath and hypotension may indicate an ongoing infection. Further evaluation may include blood cultures and imaging studies.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix to manage symptoms of shortness of breath and hypotension.
2. Consider consulting cardiac surgery for further evaluation and management of heart failure.
3. Order a D-dimer test to rule out pulmonary embolism.
4. Continue vancomycin antibiotic course to manage septic arthritis.
5. Monitor creatinine level and consider adjusting diuretic medications or initiating dialysis if necessary.
6. Trend daily hematocrit level and consider transfusions if necessary.
7. Continue to evaluate and manage any potential infections.
8. Consult with transplant nephrology and orthopedic surgery/hand for further management of the patient's kidney transplant and septic arthritis."

 .H/O MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 .H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE, along with
   sleep apnea. Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis.
   Patient with crackles and JVD on exam, although no dependent edema. The
   dose of levofloxacin she received in the ED will provide adequate
   coverage until tomorrow, given her degree of renal insufficiency.
   - IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider consulting cardiac surgery
   - check D-dimer
   .
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Desire panorex and coronary cath prior to procedure.
   .
   # Hypotension and acute renal failure.
   Interval decrease in BP
 non-symptomatic, but in 80s and creatinine
   increased. Likely overdiuresed last night.
   - Hold diuresis from this a.m. and re-evaluuate.
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need cath, most likely, prior to valulaer replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine was at recent baseline on admission
   and slightly increased this a.m. Possibly secondary to overdiuresis or
   hypotension. During the previous admission, the patient's creatinine
   was noted to rise after she had been found to have an undetectable
   tacrolimus level. She had been treated briefly with pulse-dose
   steroids, renal ultrasound was unremarkable, and she was rapidly
   tapered off of steroids.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - renal ultrasound with Doppler
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Call orthopedic surgery/hand today (hold off on ID for now)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Pending decision for MV replacement, pt will need left
   coronary cath prior to procedure.
   - Would hold on diuresis on day of MVR surgery to protect kidneys
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Stable. No active issues.
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.
   # Code. Full code, confirmed with the patient.
   # Contact. [**Name (NI) 16**] [**Name (NI) 11754**], mother/HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10098**]; HCP was [**Name (NI) 420**]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12009**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Marked diuresis which has improved her dyspnea
 Creatinine slightly
   improved to 2.4 mg/dL.
   Will ask surgery to evaluate timing of [**Hospital 12012**]
   Medical Decision Making
   Will ask surgery to evaluate timing of MVR
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis of the left ankle, and the current note mentions a small ulceration over the medial malleolus with white tissue at the base. Although there is no fever or elevated white blood cell count, the patient is being taken to the operating room today for a biopsy to rule out infection.
2. Kidney transplant failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved with diuresis, but the note mentions that the patient's creatinine levels increased with extensive diuresis on a previous admission. The patient's tacrolimus level was undetectable during that admission, and she was treated with pulse-dose steroids. The current note states that the patient's renal ultrasound with Doppler is normal, but the patient's creatinine levels will need to be closely monitored.
3. Heart failure: The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, and the current note mentions that the patient's symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. However, the patient's heart failure is likely to be ongoing, and the note recommends continuing diuresis and monitoring the patient's electrolyte and renal function.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and the current note mentions that the patient's EKG is normal and that the patient's cardiac enzymes are negative. However, the patient's coronary arteries will need to be evaluated further, and the note recommends continuing the patient's home aspirin and Plavix regimen.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently being treated with insulin. The current note mentions that the patient's glucose levels are stable, but the patient's hyperglycemia will need to be closely monitored.
6. Pain control: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and the current note mentions that the patient is experiencing acute pain. The patient's pain will need to be closely monitored and managed.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of shortness of breath, and the current note mentions that the patient's oxygen requirement is increasing. The patient's respiratory status will need to be closely monitored, and the note recommends continuing diuresis and monitoring the patient's electrolyte and renal function.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and the patient will require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE, along with
   sleep apnea. Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis.
   Patient with crackles and JVD on exam, although no dependent edema. The

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Pending decision for MV replacement, pt will need left
   coronary cath prior to procedure.
   - Would hold on diuresis on day of MVR surgery to protect kidneys
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Stable. No active issues.
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.
   # Code. Full code, confirmed with the patient.
   # Contact. [**Name (NI) 16**] [**Name (NI) 11754**], mother/HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10098**]; HCP was [**Name (NI) 420**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute onset shortness of breath, which has improved with diuresis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: O2 requirement decreasing, but still requiring oxygen therapy
* Cardiovascular: Mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure
* Renal: Creatinine improving with diuresis, but still requiring close monitoring
* Neurological: No active concerns
* Musculoskeletal: Recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, currently being treated with vancomycin
* Hematological: Anemia, currently at baseline
* Endocrine: Diabetes, insulin-dependent, stable
* Psychological: Depression, no active issues

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis of the left ankle, and the current wound care plan may not be adequate to prevent infection.
2. Kidney Transplant Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving with diuresis, but close monitoring is still necessary to prevent kidney transplant failure.
3. Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement: The patient's mitral regurgitation may require surgical intervention, which may be complicated by her history of coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is acute on chronic, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are currently elevated, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, and adequate pain control is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of septic arthritis and is currently being treated with vancomycin, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea and worsening heart failure by
   history. Other considerations include pneumonia, ACS, PE, along with
   sleep apnea. Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis.
   Patient with crackles and JVD on exam, although no dependent edema. The
   dose of levofloxacin she received in the ED will provide adequate
   coverage until tomorrow, given her degree of renal insufficiency.
   - IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider consulting cardiac surgery
   - check D-dimer
   .
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. As above, we will diurese with IV
   Lasix (80 mg boluses), with close attention to respiratory status,
   electrolytes and renal funciton. D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and CT surgery.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **]. Desire panorex and coronary cath prior to procedure.
   .
   # Hypotension and acute renal failure.
   Interval decrease in BP
 non-symptomatic, but in 80s and creatinine
   increased. Likely overdiuresed last night.
   - Hold diuresis from this a.m. and re-evaluuate.
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need cath, most likely, prior to valulaer replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine was at recent baseline on admission
   and slightly increased this a.m. Possibly secondary to overdiuresis or
   hypotension. During the previous admission, the patient's creatinine
   was noted to rise after she had been found to have an undetectable
   tacrolimus level. She had been treated briefly with pulse-dose
   steroids, renal ultrasound was unremarkable, and she was rapidly
   tapered off of steroids.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - renal ultrasound with Doppler
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Call orthopedic surgery/hand today (hold off on ID for now)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Stable. No active issues.
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.
   # Code. Full code, confirmed with the patient.
   # Contact. [**Name (NI) 16**] [**Name (NI) 11754**], mother/HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10098**]; HCP was [**Name (NI) 420**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, which is likely due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has bibasilar crackles and is requiring oxygen therapy. She has a SpO2 of 94% on a nasal cannula.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and is at risk for heart failure. She has a heart rate of 75 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 138/62 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level has increased, and she is at risk for acute renal failure.
* Wound care: The patient has a recent wound infection in her left ankle, and she is receiving vancomycin therapy.
* Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute pain and chronic pain, and she is receiving pain medication.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results are as follows:
	+ WBC: 3.5-5.3 K/uL
	+ Hct: 25.3-24.2%
	+ Plt: 346-375 K/uL
	+ Cr: 2.7-2.9 mg/dL
	+ TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
	+ TCO2: 25 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 145-281 mg/dL
	+ Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 4.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Heart failure: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension put her at risk for heart failure.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's increased creatinine level and history of kidney transplant make her at risk for acute renal failure.
* Wound infection: The patient's recent wound infection in her left ankle puts her at risk for further infection.
* Hypotension: The patient's decreased blood pressure puts her at risk for hypotension.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes and recent hyperglycemia episode put her at risk for further hyperglycemia.
* Pain management: The patient's chronic pain and recent acute pain episode require careful pain management to prevent further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IV diuresis with additional 80 mg IV Lasix to manage heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
* Continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload.
* Cycle cardiac enzymes to monitor for cardiac complications.
* Consider consulting cardiac surgery to assess the patient's mitral regurgitation and potential need for mitral valve repair.
* Check D-dimer to monitor for deep vein thrombosis.
* Hold diuresis from this morning and re-evaluate the patient's volume status.
* Continue home aspirin and Plavix to manage coronary artery disease.
* Continue home Atorvastatin to manage hyperlipidemia.
* Replete electrolytes for K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0.
* Continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus to manage kidney transplant.
* Renal ultrasound with Doppler to monitor kidney function.
* Continue vancomycin therapy for wound infection.
* Check vancomycin level to ensure adequate therapy.
* Wound care consult to assess wound healing and prevent further infection.
* Continue home pain regimen to manage chronic pain.
* Call orthopedic surgery/hand today to assess wound healing and plan for further care."

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: None.
   Imaging: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.

   Imaging: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on
   exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not
   think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who was recently hospitalized for shortness of breath and was diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for further management. Her current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* White blood cell count: 3.5 x 10^9/L

Physical examination reveals a cachectic woman with a small ulceration on the medial malleolus of the left ankle with white tissue at the base, but no exudate or surrounding erythema to suggest infection.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 346 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 145 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, magnesium 1.8 mmol/L, phosphate 4.6 mg/dL

Imaging studies show:

* Left atrium mildly dilated
* Left ventricular hypertrophy
* Mitral regurgitation
* Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Medical plan:

* Continue IV vancomycin at current dosing
* Monitor ankle tissue culture
* Continue diuresis and maintain even to slightly negative fluid balance
* Restart home lasix dose
* Continue home blood pressure regimen
* F/u cardiac surgery consult
* F/u D-dimer
* Optimize heart rate and afterload reduction

Potential medical complications:

* Osteomyelitis: The patient's left ankle ulceration and bone pain may indicate osteomyelitis, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
* Infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and current antibiotics may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the wound and bones.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease and recent diuresis may increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening kidney function.
* Wound complications: The patient's left ankle ulceration may lead to wound complications such as infection, necrosis, or delayed healing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-inch, 50.5 kg individual with a history of kidney transplant, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 98/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a fluid balance of -2,335 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 346 K/uL, and creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL. Other lab results include a blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL.

Imaging studies show mild dilatation of the left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid-inferolateral segments. The patient has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion.

The patient's medical history includes a kidney transplant, mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, acute pain, chronic pain, and has a history of transplant and mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, heparin sodium, insulin, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid management includes intravenous fluids and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is a possibility of sepsis due to the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the tissue culture.
2. Infection: The patient's tissue culture shows no microorganisms, but there is a possibility of infection due to the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
3. Heart failure: The patient has a history of heart failure, and there is a possibility of worsening heart failure due to the patient's underlying cardiac conditions.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there is a possibility of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying cardiac conditions.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and there is a possibility of hypoglycemia due to the patient's insulin therapy.
6. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin sodium, and there is a possibility of bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the

   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held yesterday as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then
   developed worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100
   mg lasix last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles
   or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as
   do not think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was admitted to the ICU for acute onset shortness of breath, which was likely due to decompensated heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.4°C (97.6°F), HR: 75 bpm, BP: 98/42 mmHg, RR: 11 breaths per minute, SpO2: 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving IV heparin for prophylaxis, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 830 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with 580 mL given through the oral route and 250 mL given through the IV route.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving any respiratory support, but her oxygen saturation is 94%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 3.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 7.9 g/dL, and platelet count is 346 x 10^9/L. Her blood urea nitrogen is 26 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild left atrial enlargement, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of recent septic arthritis of her left ankle, and there is a concern that the ulceration on her ankle may be infected. A bone biopsy is planned to rule out infection.
2. Heart failure: The patient's mitral regurgitation is severe, and she may require valve replacement surgery. However, this surgery is contingent on the patient's overall health and the results of further testing.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery systolic pressure is moderately elevated, which may increase her risk of developing pulmonary hypertension.
4. Kidney transplant rejection: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of kidney transplant rejection if her immunosuppressive therapy is not optimal.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of her recent septic arthritis and her immunocompromised state.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and her current cardiac status may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, but she may require respiratory support if her condition deteriorates.
8. Sepsis: The patient's recent septic arthritis and her immunocompromised state make her at risk of developing sepsis.
9. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of renal failure if her kidney function does not improve.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and her current cardiac status may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest."

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Blood glucose: 353 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 4.2 mg/dL

The patient's echo report shows:

* Mild dilatation of the left atrium
* Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
* Unusually small left ventricular cavity
* Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments
* Normal overall left ventricular systolic function (LVEF > 55%)
* Mild thickening of the aortic valve leaflets
* Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
* Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* No pericardial effusion

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypoglycemia due to the patient's history of diabetes and high blood glucose levels
* Infection due to the patient's history of renal transplant and immunosuppression
* Cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction due to the patient's history of coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation
* Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to the patient's history of renal transplant and immunosuppression
* Neurological complications such as seizures or stroke due to the patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with a history of mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. She is currently receiving treatment for hyperglycemia, pain control, and heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 10 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a cachectic appearance, mitral regurgitation murmur, and a small ulceration on her left lower extremity. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood urea nitrogen.

The patient's imaging studies, including an echocardiogram, show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of mitral regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation is moderate to severe, and worsening of this condition can lead to heart failure and reduced cardiac output.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure and chronic kidney disease increases her risk of worsening heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and death.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Infection: The patient's history of mitral regurgitation and chronic kidney disease increases her risk of developing infections, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of mitral regurgitation and chronic kidney disease increases her risk of developing thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, and death.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including worsening of mitral regurgitation, heart failure, hyperglycemia, infection, and thrombosis. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve her outcomes."

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on
   exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not
   think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent living-related kidney transplant. She was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath, presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. During her hospitalization, she developed acute onset shortness of breath, which improved with diuresis. She also has a recent leg ulcer and acute episode of heart failure and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Her physical examination is notable for a cachectic appearance, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. Her cardiac enzymes are normal, and her electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm.

The patient's medical plan includes diuresis with furosemide, continuation of her home blood pressure regimen, and a cardiac surgery consult. She will also undergo a bone biopsy to rule out osteomyelitis, and her wound care will be managed by the orthopedic service.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's recent leg ulcer and acute episode of heart failure and acute renal failure increase her risk of developing osteomyelitis.
2. Heart failure: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension put her at risk for further deterioration in her heart function, leading to heart failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent episode of acute renal failure increases her risk of developing further acute renal failure, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
4. Infection: The patient's recent leg ulcer and acute episode of heart failure and acute renal failure increase her risk of developing infection, particularly if her wound care is not adequate.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and her recent episode of acute renal failure increase her risk of developing thrombosis, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of diabetes and her recent episode of acute renal failure increase her risk of developing electrolyte imbalance, particularly if her blood sugar is not well-controlled.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and her recent episode of acute renal failure increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if her heart function is not well-compensated.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and to ensure her overall well-being."

   MICRO: [**4-30**]  tissue culture no growth
   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:
   - per ID, patient can complete vancomycin course on [**5-2**] and should have
   repeat bone biopsy as outpatient (off antibiotics) versus suppressive
   antibiotics with minocycline or doxycycline for ""prolonged course"" ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   last night with 2 L urine output.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on
   exam.  O2 requirement decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not
   think the patient is infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   -          continue to trend daily hematocrit
   -          transfuse for < 27
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Elevated blood glucose to 500 yesterday.
   - needs [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   - Glargine per home regimen: 22u qhs
   - humalog insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.
   # Access. Right-sided PICC line.
   # Prophylaxis. HSQ, bowel regimen, PPI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and mitral regurgitation who presented with acute onset shortness of breath and was admitted to the ICU. She has a recent history of septic arthritis of her left ankle and is currently undergoing treatment with vancomycin. She has also had a kidney transplant and is taking immunosuppressive medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 10 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a cachectic woman who appears older than her stated age, with a normal cardiac examination and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Her lung examination shows clear lungs, and her abdominal examination is soft and non-tender.

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and mitral regurgitation, and she has had a recent episode of heart failure. She is currently undergoing treatment with diuretics and has a PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's left ankle ulcer may be tracking to the bone, and there is a risk of developing osteomyelitis. A bone biopsy is planned to rule out infection.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently undergoing treatment with diuretics. There is a risk of worsening heart failure if her fluid status is not closely monitored.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which may be exacerbated by her mitral regurgitation.
4. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient has a history of kidney transplant and is taking immunosuppressive medications, which may increase her risk of kidney dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of septic arthritis and is currently undergoing treatment with vancomycin. There is a risk of developing another infection, particularly in the context of her immunosuppressed state.
6. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has a history of diabetes and was recently found to have a blood glucose level of 500 mg/dL. There is a risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis if her blood glucose levels are not closely monitored and controlled.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust her diuretic therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
3. Consider obtaining a bone biopsy to rule out osteomyelitis.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her immunosuppressive medications as needed.
5. Consider obtaining a pulmonary artery catheter to assess the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
6. Monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Consider obtaining a cardiac catheterization to assess the patient's coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation."

   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   with 2 L urine output.  She has been converted to her home dose PO
   lasix.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement
   decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not think the patient is
   infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Home dose lasix was 80 mg Q every other day. However, this resulted
   in fluid retention requiring hospitalization.  Will plan to continue
   lasix 80 mg q day and follow Is/Os and creatinine
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   # ? Osteomyelitis: During her previous admission she was evaluated by
   the orthopedics service who felt that her left ankle was healing
   appropriately.  Films of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of
   osteomylitis.  Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No fevers

   prophylaxis with doxycycline or minocycline.  Last day vanc today.
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:
   - per ID, patient can complete vancomycin course on [**5-2**] and should have
   repeat bone biopsy as outpatient (off antibiotics) versus suppressive
   antibiotics with minocycline or doxycycline for ""prolonged course"" ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   with 2 L urine output.  She has been converted to her home dose PO
   lasix.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement
   decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not think the patient is
   infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Home dose lasix was 80 mg Q every other day. However, this resulted
   in fluid retention requiring hospitalization.  Will plan to continue
   lasix 80 mg q day and follow Is/Os and creatinine
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   # ? Osteomyelitis: During her previous admission she was evaluated by
   the orthopedics service who felt that her left ankle was healing
   appropriately.  Films of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of
   osteomylitis.  Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No fevers
   or white count. Ortho performed biopsy to r/o osteomylitis and cultures
   have shown no growth to date.  However, this was performed on
   antibiotics.  ID recommends repeat biopsy off antibiotics versus
   prophylaxis with doxycycline or minocycline.  Last day vanc today.
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Would favor stopping antibiotics for one week and repeat biopsy so
   that patient does not have to be on maintenance antibiotics.  Would
   also like definitive answer regarding osteomylitis if we are
   considering a mitral valve replacement soon.
   - continue wound vac
   - will need f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 818**] next week and schedule OR for repeat
   bx
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically we are
   waiting for MV replacement given her recent leg ulcer and acute episode
   of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   pending no infection on repeat biopsy off antibiotics
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - continue lasix 80 mg PO Q day
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath prior to valvular replacement (in 2 weeks pending
   repeat biopsy).
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Anemia. Currently at baseline.
   -          continue to trend daily hematocrit
   -          transfuse for < 27
   .
   # Diabetes, insulin dependent. Elevated blood glucose to 500 yesterday.
   - needs [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # Depression. No active issues.
   - continue home Wellbutrin and citalopram
   .
   # FEN. Diabetic, heart-healthy, low-sodium diet.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who has undergone a living-related kidney transplant. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute onset of shortness of breath, presumed to be related to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T max 36.6°C, T current 36.3°C, HR 79 bpm, BP 122/60 mmHg, RR 10 breaths/min, SpO2 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is euvolemic after diuresis with IV lasix.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,330 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a balance of -1,095 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, but her SpO2 is 97%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 3.6 K/uL, Hct is 23.2%, and Plt is 388 K/uL. Her Cr is 1.8 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 65 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: The patient's echo study showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Development of osteomyelitis in the left ankle, which could lead to sepsis and further complications.
3. Renal transplant failure, which could lead to worsening kidney function and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hyperglycemia, which could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
5. Coronary artery disease, which could lead to myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
6. Pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.

To prevent these complications, the patient should continue to receive diuretic therapy to maintain euvolemia, and her blood glucose level should be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia. She should also continue to receive antibiotics to prevent infection, and her wound should be closely monitored for signs of infection or healing. Additionally, her electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent electrolyte imbalances."

   Echo [**2149-4-30**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
   [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
   given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
   the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower. The
   other findings are similar.
   CONSULTS:
   - per ID, patient can complete vancomycin course on [**5-2**] and should have
   repeat bone biopsy as outpatient (off antibiotics) versus suppressive
   antibiotics with minocycline or doxycycline for ""prolonged course"" ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation
   and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness
   of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of breath. Likely orthopnea from decompensated CHF.
   Symptoms and oxygenation have improved with diuresis. Lasix was
   initially held as she was thought to be euvolemic, but then developed
   worsening O2 requirement and patient was given a dose of 100 mg lasix
   with 2 L urine output.  She has been converted to her home dose PO
   lasix.  She no longer has crackles or JVD on exam.  O2 requirement
   decreasing as well.  No antibiotics as do not think the patient is
   infected.
   - Continue to diurese/maintain even to slightly negative (500 cc)
   output
   - Will clarify home lasix dose with mother and [**Name (NI) 1163**] and likely restart
   this maintainance dose (80 mg Q every other day)
   - continue home blood pressure regimen to reduce afterload
   - f/u cardiac surgery consult
   - f/u D-dimer
   - optimal HR and afterload reduction
   # ? Osteomyelitis: Can track ulcer to bone, pt with pain there. No
   fevers or white count. Ortho is taking to OR today for biopsy to r/o
   infection.
   - F/u CRP/ESR
   - Bone biopsy today by ortho
   - ID consult and ortho recs, appreciate their input
   - Wound care recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue vanc
   - Check daily vanc level
   # Pump / dCHF / mitral regurgitation. Patient appears euvolemic after
   diuresis with [**Hospital1 **] IV lasix.  Patient looks so well clinically that it
   may be best to wait a little while for the MV replacement given her
   recent leg ulcer and acute episode of CHF and ARF.
   - will hold off on catheterization and valve surgery for 3 weeks
   - plan to have her return for outpatient catheterization and pre-op w/u
   in 2 weeks
   - restart home dose Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Coronaries.
   EKG without ischemic changes. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue home aspirin and Plavix
   - continue home Atorvastatin
   - Will need R/L cath, most likely, prior to valvular replacement.
   .
   # Rhythm. Sinus rhythm on EKG. No active concerns.
   - replete electrolytes for K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0
   .
   # S/p kidney transplant. Creatinine improving with diuresis.  Was noted
   to increase with extensive diuresis on prior admission. During the
   previous admission, the patient's creatinine was noted to rise after
   she had been found to have an undetectable tacrolimus level. She had
   been treated briefly with pulse-dose steroids, renal ultrasound was
   unremarkable, and she was rapidly tapered off of steroids.  Currently
   no signs of renal transplant failure.  Renal ultrasound with Doppler
   normal.
   - appreciate transplant nephrology recs
   - continue home prednisone and Tacrolimus (doses confirmed with HCP)
   - daily tacro levels at 5:30 am
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. Per most recent discharge
   summary, plan is for a 6-week course of vancomycin that will end on
   [**5-2**]. During her previous admission she was evaluated by the orthopedics
   service who felt that her left ankle was healing appropriately.  Films
   of ankle and knee showed no obvious evidence of osteomylitis
   - continue vancomycin, antibiotic course to end on [**2149-5-2**]
   - check vancomycin level
   - wound care consult
   - continue home pain regimen
   - Orthopedic surgery taking to OR today
   - ID consulted (appreciate recs)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent living-related kidney transplantation. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute shortness of breath, likely due to decompensated chronic heart failure (CHF) and mitral regurgitation. She has also developed an ulcer on her left lower extremity, which may be infected. The patient's medical history is significant for recent hospitalization for shortness of breath, presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's ulcer on her left lower extremity may be infected, and the orthopedic service is taking her to the OR for biopsy to rule out infection.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's CHF is likely to worsen if not managed properly, and she may require further diuresis and vasodilators to reduce afterload.
3. Kidney Transplant Failure: The patient's creatinine levels may increase if she does not receive proper care and management of her kidney transplant.
4. Infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and current admission to the ICU increase her risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level was elevated to 500 yesterday, and she may require further management of her diabetes to prevent complications.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD and recent hospitalization for shortness of breath may indicate a higher risk of cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further symptoms of shortness of breath and decreased cardiac function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis and vasodilators to manage CHF and reduce afterload.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent kidney transplant failure.
3. Implement infection prevention measures to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections.
4. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin and other medications as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent cardiac events.
6. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's mitral regurgitation to prevent further symptoms and complications."
