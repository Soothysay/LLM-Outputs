   Assessment and Plan
   85-yo man w/ HTN and PAF who presented to the ED w/ dry mouth in the
   setting of treatment for BPH, then found to convert from NSR to A-Fib
   w/ [**Year (4 digits) **] to 120s-130s. Initially controlled on the floor w/ Diltiazem,
   but progressively developed worsening [**Year (4 digits) **], hypoxia, and altered mental
   status, requiring transfer to the CCU.
   .
   #. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - Pt w/ h/o PAF which he has not
   tolerated in the past. Previously controlled with BB, although this was
   changed to CCB [**3-9**] orthostatic hypotension. A-Fib w/ [**Month/Day (2) **] on admission
   today unable to be controlled with CCB but responsive to BB.
   - cont BB boluses PRN for [**Month/Day (2) **], uptitrate PO dose as needed
   - heparin gtt for anticoagulation as pt is at elevated risk of stroke
   - will likely need cardioversion given h/o intolerance of A-fib,
   consider chemical vs. electrical cardioversion in AM
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Pt w/ ARF on presentation as below, treated w/ 2L NS given
   concern for pre-renal azotemia. In setting of A-fib w/ [**Name (NI) **], pt likely
   w/ pulmonary edema [**3-9**] poor LV filling time. Responded well to IV Lasix
   boluses received on floor prior to transfer.
   - closely monitor UOP, repeat IV Lasix boluses PRN
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and renal function
   .
   #. Altered mental status - Unclear etiology, likely multifactorial
   including PAF w/ [**Hospital1 **], hypoxia, anti-cholinergic medication effect,
   sun-downing, ICU psychosis, and baseline dementia. Not improved w/ rate
   control or diuresis.
   - cont rate control and diuresis as above
   - IV Haldol PRN
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt w/ hypertension at home, treated only with
   Diltiazem. BPs here have responded to both Dilt and BB treatment for
   rate control.
   - continue to monitor while treating for rate control as above
   - holding Dilt while trying Lopressor for rate control
   - continue Florinef
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 926 mL of fluid, with a net loss of 34 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count 109 K/uL.
	+ Electrolyte levels: Sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 4.6 mEq/L, and chloride 15 mEq/L.
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels: 70 mg/dL and 3.4 mg/dL, respectively.
	+ Troponin-T level: 0.03 ng/mL.

The patient's diagnosis is as follows:

* Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)
* Hypoxia
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Altered mental status
* Hypertension
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Cardioversion for PAF
* Heparin for anticoagulation
* IV Lasix boluses for diuresis
* IV Haldol for altered mental status
* Continuing rate control with beta blockers
* Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels
* Repeat IV Lasix boluses as needed
* Consideration of chemical or electrical cardioversion in the morning

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary edema due to PAF and poor left ventricular filling
* Worsening of ARF due to inadequate diuresis
* Increased risk of stroke due to PAF and lack of anticoagulation
* Development of sepsis due to prolonged ICU stay and increased risk of infection
* Worsening of hypertension due to inadequate treatment
* Development of chronic kidney disease due to prolonged ARF

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85-yo man w/ HTN and PAF who presented to the ED w/ dry mouth in the
   setting of treatment for BPH, then found to convert from NSR to A-Fib
   w/ RVR to 120s-130s. Initially controlled on the floor w/ Diltiazem,
   but progressively developed worsening RVR, hypoxia, and altered mental
   status, requiring transfer to the CCU. Now with worsening renal
   failure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up, now 3.4 from
   2.6 yesterday. AG metabolic acidosis likely from both lactic acidosis
   and renal failure. Urine lytes revealed FeUrea < 35%, consistent with
   prerenal physiology. Urine output was very minimal yesterday but
   started to increase with fluid challenges. Renal u/s unremarkable.
   - NS boluses throughout the day
   -  follow lytes closely
   - urine sediments
   - renal consult if no improvement
   .
   # Possible UTI: with pyuria, renal failure. BP has been stable so far.
   - continue empiric rx of ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx
   .
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - Pt w/ h/o PAF which he has not
   tolerated in the past. Previously controlled with BB, although this was
   changed to CCB [**3-9**] orthostatic hypotension. A-Fib w/ RVR on admission
   today unable to be controlled with CCB but responsive to BB. HR well
   controlled overnight.
   - d/c amio because of rising LFTs; start digoxin
   - continue beta blocker for rate control
   - INR currently therapeutic
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely similar to past delirium while in
   hospital. No localized neuro deficit. Much better this morning than
   yesterday.
   - monitor mental status
   - re-orient as needed
   - avoid psychotropic meds if possible
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: transaminases continue to rise.  ?shock physiology.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider checking hepatitis panel
   # Hypertension - Pt w/ hypertension at home, treated only with
   Diltiazem. BPs here have responded to both Dilt and BB treatment for
   rate control.
   - continue to monitor while treating for rate control as above
   - holding Dilt while trying Lopressor for rate control
   - continue Florinef
   .
   #. Orthostatic hypotension - Pt tx w/ Florinef at home. Also BB was
   changed to CCB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and treated for BPH at home. The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a dry mouth, which led to the conversion from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up, and urine output is minimal, with a recent fluid challenge showing some improvement. Urine electrolytes are consistent with prerenal physiology.
2. Possible urinary tract infection (UTI): With pyuria and renal failure, the patient is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone, and a follow-up urine culture is pending.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of PAF, which he has not tolerated in the past. He was previously controlled with a beta blocker (BB), but this was changed to a calcium channel blocker (CCB) due to orthostatic hypotension. A-Fib with RVR on admission was unable to be controlled with CCB but responded to BB. Digoxin is being started, and the patient will continue to receive a beta blocker for rate control.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of delirium while in the hospital, and his mental status is currently being monitored. He is being re-oriented as needed and is being avoided from receiving psychotropic medications.
5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's transaminases are continuing to rise, and the cause is unknown. The patient's LFTs are being trended, and a hepatitis panel is being considered.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension at home, which is being treated with Diltiazem. His blood pressure has responded to both Dilt and BB treatment for rate control.
7. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient is being treated with Florinef at home and has been changed to a beta blocker for rate control.
8. Other medical conditions: The patient has DJD, depression, and is taking home medications for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending upwards, and further fluid challenges may be necessary to improve urine output.
2. UTI: The patient's pyuria and renal failure suggest a possible UTI, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of PAF and current AFib with RVR require close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's history of delirium and current altered mental status require close monitoring and re-orientation as needed to prevent further decline.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's rising LFTs require further investigation to determine the cause and potential treatment.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications.
7. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient's orthostatic hypotension requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further episodes.
8. Other medical conditions: The patient's DJD, depression, and other medical conditions require ongoing management and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and depression. He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) of 120-130 beats per minute. He was initially controlled on the floor with diltiazem, but his RVR worsened, and he developed hypoxia and altered mental status, requiring transfer to the critical care unit.

The patient's current condition is:

* Renal failure: creatinine has trended up to 3.4 mg/dL, and urine output is minimal.
* Metabolic acidosis: likely due to lactic acidosis and renal failure.
* Urine lytes: FeUrea < 35%, consistent with prerenal physiology.
* Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the patient's PAF has not been tolerated in the past, and he has had orthostatic hypotension.
* Altered mental status: likely similar to past delirium while in hospital.
* Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): transaminases continue to rise.
* Hypertension: the patient's BP has been stable, and he is being treated with beta blockers and diltiazem.
* Orthostatic hypotension: the patient is being treated with Florinef.
* Depression: the patient is being treated with Celexa.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further worsening of renal failure
* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Progression of metabolic acidosis
* Increased risk of infection due to urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events due to atrial fibrillation and hypertension
* Increased risk of bleeding due to liver dysfunction and anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of delirium and altered mental status due to underlying medical conditions and medications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan is to:

* Continue empiric treatment for UTI with ceftriaxone
* Monitor urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Monitor liver function tests and consider checking hepatitis panel
* Continue treatment for atrial fibrillation with digoxin and beta blockers
* Monitor mental status and avoid psychotropic medications if possible
* Continue to monitor and manage hypertension and orthostatic hypotension
* Consider consulting a nephrologist for further management of renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) who presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate. He was initially controlled on the floor with diltiazem, but subsequently developed worsening renal failure, hypoxia, and altered mental status, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: SpO2 of 100% on room air, no respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular status: Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/92 mmHg, and a cardiac output of 2.3 L/min.
* Renal status: Creatinine trending up to 3.7 mg/dL, urine output increasing to over 1 L since midnight, and oliguria.
* Hepatic status: Elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock physiology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to have converted from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was initially controlled on the floor with diltiazem, but his condition progressively worsened, leading to worsening renal failure, hypoxia, and altered mental status. He was transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) and is currently being treated with empiric antibiotics for possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, and his urine output has increased, but his kidney function is still compromised. He requires close monitoring of his urine output and electrolytes.
2. Possible UTI: The patient's pyuria and renal failure suggest a possible UTI, and he is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone. Further urine cultures are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Reduced LVEF: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced, which may be contributing to his renal and hepatic hypoperfusion. He may require cardiac catheterization during his admission to determine the etiology of his reduced LVEF.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's PAF is poorly controlled, and he requires rate control with beta blockers. His INR is supratherapeutic, and he requires close monitoring of his anticoagulation therapy.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to his underlying medical conditions and may be contributing to his delirium. He requires close monitoring of his mental status and re-orientation as needed.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which may be related to shock physiology from hypoperfusion. He requires close monitoring of his LFTs and further evaluation for liver dysfunction.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and he requires further evaluation and treatment to manage his blood pressure.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his fluid infusions and may require close monitoring of his fluid status.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and requires close monitoring of his respiratory status.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) who was admitted to the ICU with worsening renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. He had a previous episode of atrial fibrillation that was not well-tolerated. On admission, he was found to have a heart rate of 120-130 beats per minute, hypoxia, and altered mental status, which required transfer to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 133/92 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and impaired physical mobility. His creatinine level has continued to trend up, now at 3.7 mg/dL, and his urine output has increased to over 1 liter since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.0-12.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 41.6-41.5%
* Platelet count: 102-96 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.6-3.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 5.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* LDH: 617 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 6.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring urine output throughout the day
* Following electrolytes, BUN, and Cr levels
* Considering LR boluses if needed
* Continuing empiric antibiotic therapy for possible UTI
* Monitoring mental status and re-orienting as needed
* Avoiding psychotropic medications if possible
* Trending LFTs and following hepatitis panel
* Holding Diltiazem and discontinuing fludrocort

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   85M w/ HTN and PAF (not on Coumadin [**3-9**] fall risk), who originally
   presented to the ED w/ dry mouth in the setting of BPH treatment, was
   found to convert from NSR to A-Fib w/ RVR to 120s-130s. Initially
   rate-controlled on the floor w/ diltiazem, but progressively developed
   worsening RVR, w hypoxia and altered mental status, requiring transfer
   to the CCU.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented to the emergency department with dry mouth and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. He was initially rate-controlled on the floor with diltiazem, but developed worsening rapid ventricular rate, hypoxia, and altered mental status, requiring transfer to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.3°C, HR: 99 bpm, BP: 133/92 mmHg, RR: 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 97%
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device: CPAP mask, SpO2: 97%, ABG: pH 7.26
* Cardiovascular status: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, heart rhythm irregular, tachycardic
* Renal function: Creatinine improved to 3.2 mg/dL, urine output: 5.3 L over the past 24 hours
* Hepatic function: Hepatitis panel pending
* Infectious disease: Possible UTI with pyuria and renal failure, urine culture positive for K. pneumoniae
* Laboratory results: AST: 491 IU/L, ALT: 690 IU/L, AP: 168 IU/L, WBC: 9.0 x 10^9/L, Hct: 41.6%, Plt: 102 x 10^9/L, Cr: 2.6 mg/dL, TropT: 0.03 ng/mL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate
* Development of heart failure
* Progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Potential for sepsis due to UTI
* Development of liver dysfunction or failure
* Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypernatremia and hyperkalemia
* Risk of falls due to altered mental status and orthostatic hypotension
* Potential for respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac rhythm
* Adjust antibiotic therapy to cefpodoxime 200mg PO q24h for 14 days
* Hold ACEI and follow electrolytes, BUN, and Cr
* Encourage PO free water intake to manage hypernatremia
* Continue to trend LFTs until downtrending
* Follow hepatitis panel results
* Monitor mental status and avoid psychotropic medications if possible
* Consider cardiac catheterization during this admission or as an outpatient
* Continue metoprolol and consider further uptitration if heart rate remains in the 90s-100s."
