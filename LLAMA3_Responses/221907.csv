   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically management admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential diagnosis at this time includes infectious
   process versus decompensated heart failure.  Patient with known CHF
   with EF of 30% now with increased dry weight by 10 lbs. Potential
   infectious sources include urosepsis versus pneumonia. Patient does
   have significant pyuria, but is unable to give clear urinary symptoms
   at home including dysuria or polyuria.  Patient with CXR in ED
   consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and increased retrocardiac
   opacity concerning for effusion versus atelectasis, although patient
   with recently treated CAP as outpatient with azithromycin.  Patient
   also has history of PE, but this is less likely to be new PE causing
   cor pulmonale given therapeutic INR and recent IVC filter placement.
   - Dopamine gtt titrate to MAP>60, consider trial of dobutamine with
   vigileo to assess cardiac index.
   - Cardiology consult to assess for decompensated heart failure.
   - TTE today
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives
   - Consider consulting cardiology for heart failure management
   - Consider changing coverage to vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload in patient
   with known systolic heart failure, baseline COPD although without signs
   of exacerbation.
   - Lasix gtt at tolerated by BP
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion and
   forward flow from decompensated heart failure or sepsis.
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a significant past medical history, including COPD, recent pulmonary embolism (PE), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is persistently low, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. The differential diagnosis includes infectious process versus decompensated heart failure.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has dyspnea, which is likely multifactorial, including fluid overload and baseline COPD.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to decreased renal perfusion and forward flow from decompensated heart failure or sepsis.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a recent NSTEMI, which was medically managed. He is also at risk for decompensated heart failure due to his known systolic heart failure and fluid overload.
5. Infectious processes: The patient has pyuria, but is unable to give clear urinary symptoms. He has a recent history of pneumonia, and his chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions and increased retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to effusion or atelectasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate level suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of NSTEMI and decompensated heart failure puts him at risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral pleural effusions may lead to ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
4. Kidney failure: The patient's ARF may progress to kidney failure, which can require dialysis and significantly impact his quality of life.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pyuria and recent history of pneumonia put him at risk for developing a new pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, cardiac arrest, ARDS, kidney failure, and pneumonia. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential diagnosis at this time includes
   decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.
   Patient with known CHF with EF of 30% now with increased dry weight by
   10 lbs. Potential infectious sources include urosepsis versus
   pneumonia. Patient does have significant pyuria, but is unable to give
   clear urinary symptoms at home including dysuria or polyuria.  Patient
   with CXR in ED consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and
   increased retrocardiac opacity concerning for effusion versus
   pneumonia, although patient with recently treated CAP as outpatient
   with azithromycin.  Patient also has history of PE, but this is less
   likely to be new PE causing cor pulmonale given therapeutic INR and
   recent IVC filter placement.
   - Check mixed venous O2 sat
   - Continue dopamine, add dobutamine.
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated heart
   failure..
   - TTE today
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives
   - Discontinue vancomycin, continue ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload in patient
   with known systolic heart failure, possibly secondary to ARF from lasix
   and baseline COPD although without signs of exacerbation including
   wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # UTI: Continue ceftriaxone for 7 days ([**1-15**]),
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 26.4 with MCV 95 with
   unknown etiology to acute decrease.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Hemolysis labs
   - Recheck hct Q12H.  Would consider transfusing for hct<25 given recent
   NSTEMI, but this will be difficult given patient
s volume status.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with multiple PE in [**7-17**] currently on
   coumadin with mildly supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue coumadin.
   .
   # EtOH abuse: Past history of EtOH use.
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/low Na diet, fluid restriction as above, replete as
   necessary

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 79-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD, recent PE, and NSTEMI, is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Hypotension, which is being managed with dopamine infusion
* Increased oxygen requirement to 5L facemask
* Pyuria, which led to the initiation of vancomycin and ceftriaxone
* Placement of an arterial line and a multi-lumen catheter

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (83-93 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/48 mmHg (98/48-100/52 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (11-27 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 26.4%
* Platelet count: 171 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 106 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Lethargy, unable to stay awake
* Bilateral rales, with decreased breath sounds at the left base
* Muffled heart sounds, with a soft systolic murmur
* Presence of bilateral pedal edema
* Neurological examination shows lethargy, able to follow simple commands

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count, suggesting infection
* Decreased hematocrit, indicating anemia
* Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, suggesting acute renal failure
* Elevated troponin, suggesting recent myocardial infarction

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia
* Cardiomegaly with mild congestion, possible small bilateral effusions

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis, given the patient's pyuria and elevated white blood cell count
* Decompensated heart failure, given the patient's history of systolic heart failure and recent NSTEMI
* Acute renal failure, given the patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen
* Pneumonia, given the patient's left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray
* Cardiac arrhythmias, given the patient's history of recent NSTEMI and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing dopamine infusion and adding dobutamine
* Monitoring mixed venous oxygen saturation
* Ordering a transthoracic echocardiogram
* Holding off on anti-hypertensives
* Discontinuing vancomycin and continuing ceftriaxone
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting therapy accordingly
* Continuing cardiac medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and a statin
* Monitoring for signs of acute renal failure and adjusting therapy accordingly
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy with coumadin
* Monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism and adjusting therapy accordingly

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical issues to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

   Microbiology: Blood & Urine- P
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: This most likely represents decompensated heart
   failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.  Pt ECHO shows
   reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis.  BNP was >36,000.
   Cards was consulted and recommended diuresis and attempting to wean
   pressors.  Pt negative 400cc yesterday.  Potential infectious sources
   include urosepsis versus pneumonia.  Urine and blood cx pending.
   Patient with CXR showing possible retrocardiac opacity concerning for
   effusion versus pneumonia, although patient with recently treated CAP
   as outpatient with azithromycin.  Patient also has history of PE, but
   this is less likely to be new PE causing cor pulmonale given
   therapeutic INR and recent IVC filter placement.
   - Cont gentle diuresis negative 1-2L as long as BP can tolerate.
   - Continue dobutamine and dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - f/u Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated
   heart failure..
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives and restart BB & ACE when BP tolerate
   and off pressors
   - Continue ceftriaxone
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to
   decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary
   to ARF (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD
   although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   Improving today 2.1 despite lasix gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Microbiology: Blood & Urine- P
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: This most likely represents decompensated heart
   failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.  Pt ECHO shows
   reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis.  BNP was >36,000.
   Cards was consulted and recommended diuresis and attempting to wean
   pressors.  Pt negative 400cc yesterday.  Potential infectious sources
   include urosepsis versus pneumonia.  Urine and blood cx pending.
   Patient with CXR showing possible retrocardiac opacity concerning for
   effusion versus pneumonia, although patient with recently treated CAP
   as outpatient with azithromycin.  Patient also has history of PE, but
   this is less likely to be new PE causing cor pulmonale given
   therapeutic INR and recent IVC filter placement.
   - Cont gentle diuresis negative 1-2L as long as BP can tolerate.
   - Continue dobutamine and dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - f/u Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated
   heart failure..
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives and restart BB & ACE when BP tolerate
   and off pressors
   - Continue ceftriaxone
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to
   decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary
   to ARF (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD
   although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   Improving today 2.1 despite lasix gtt
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # UTI: Continue ceftriaxone for 7 days ([**1-15**]),
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 27.9 after 1U pRBC
   with unknown etiology to acute decrease.  Pt haptoglobin (230) and
   TBili mildly elevated.  LDH normal.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Recheck hct & hemolysis labs Q12H.  Would consider transfusing for

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a significant past medical history, including COPD, recent PE, and recent NSTEMI. He is currently admitted to the ICU for 4-5 days of SOB, nonproductive cough, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/43 mmHg, which is likely due to decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock.
* Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, which is likely multifactorial, including fluid overload due to decompensated systolic heart failure, possibly secondary to ARF, and baseline COPD.
* CAD: The patient had a recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.
* ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward flow from decompensated heart failure.
* UTI: The patient is being treated for a UTI with ceftriaxone for 7 days.
* Anemia: The patient has acute anemia with a hemoglobin level of 27.9, which is likely due to unknown etiology.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of multiple PE and is currently on coumadin with a mildly supratherapeutic INR.

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Dopamine and dobutamine infusions to support blood pressure
* Lasix gtt to promote diuresis
* Ceftriaxone for UTI
* ASA, plavix, and statin for CAD
* Coumadin for PE
* Thiamine and folate for EtOH abuse

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 27.9
* Hematocrit: 26.4
* White blood cell count: 8.5
* Platelet count: 171
* Creatinine: 2.1
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21.3%
* Electrolytes: Sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 5.1 mmol/L, magnesium 2.1 mmol/L, phosphate 5.1 mmol/L
* Liver enzymes: ALT 19 IU/L, AST 22 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 38 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL
* Lipase: 52 IU/L
* Glucose: 91 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* ECHO: Severe global LV hypokinesis with moderate LV dilatation, moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output can lead to cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening.
* ARF: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
* Sepsis: The patient's UTI and potential pneumonia can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
* Heart failure: The patient's decompensated systolic heart failure can worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PE and current anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with frequent assessment of his hemodynamic status, respiratory function, and renal function."

   Microbiology: Blood & Urine- P
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3453**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD
   on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and
   recent NSTEMI medically managed admitted for 4-5 days of SOB,
   nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: This most likely represents decompensated heart
   failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.  Pt ECHO shows
   reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis.  BNP was >36,000.
   Cards was consulted and recommended diuresis and attempting to wean
   pressors.  Pt negative 400cc yesterday.  Potential infectious sources
   include urosepsis versus pneumonia.  Urine and blood cx pending.
   Patient with worsening CXR showing possible retrocardiac opacity
   concerning for effusion versus pneumonia, although patient with
   recently treated CAP as outpatient with azithromycin.  Patient also has
   history of PE, but this is less likely to be new PE causing cor
   pulmonale given therapeutic INR and recent IVC filter placement.
   - Cont gentle diuresis negative 1-2L as long as BP can tolerate.
   - Continue dobutamine and dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today
   - f/u Cardiology consult for recommendations regarding decompensated
   heart failure..
   - Hold off on anti-hypertensives and restart BB & ACE when BP tolerate
   and off pressors
   - Change abx to vanco,zosyn, levofloxacin
   ..
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to
   decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary
   to ARF (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD
   although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
   - Lasix gtt/dobutamine/dopamine as above.
   - Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn
   - Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L
   - Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L)
   - Hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   # CAD: Recent NSTEMI that was medically managed.  ECG without evidence
   of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to
   pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward
   flow from decompensated heart failure.  Baseline creatinine 1-1.2.
   Improving today 2.1 despite lasix gtt
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # UTI: Continue ceftriaxone for 7 days ([**1-15**]),
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 27.9 after 1U pRBC
   with unknown etiology to acute decrease.  Pt haptoglobin (230) and
   TBili mildly elevated.  LDH normal.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Recheck hct & hemolysis labs Q12H.  Would consider transfusing for
   hct<25 given recent NSTEMI, but this will be difficult given patient
   volume status.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with multiple PE in [**7-17**] currently on
   coumadin with mildly supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue coumadin decrease dose to 1mg.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and dyspnea. The patient has a history of COPD, recent PE, and recent NSTEMI medically managed.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/43 mmHg, which is likely due to decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial, including fluid overload due to decompensated systolic heart failure, possibly secondary to acute renal failure (ARF), and baseline COPD.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's ECHO shows reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis, with BNP >36,000.
4. ARF: The patient's creatinine is trending down from 2.1 to 1.0, suggesting pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward flow from decompensated heart failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 27.9, with unknown etiology for acute decrease. Haptoglobin and TBili are mildly elevated.
6. UTI: The patient is being treated for a UTI with ceftriaxone for 7 days.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of multiple PE and is currently on coumadin with a mildly supratherapeutic INR.
8. EtOH abuse: The patient has a past history of EtOH use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and reduced EF make them at risk for cardiogenic shock.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF and pre-renal azotemia may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea and COPD make them at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and history of PE make them at risk for sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and potential cardiac tamponade make them at risk for bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's cardiac and low sodium diet, fluid restriction, and potential for malabsorption make them at risk for malnutrition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Gentle diuresis with goal -1-2L as long as BP can tolerate.
2. Continue dobutamine and dopamine, wean as tolerated.
3. Lasix gtt with goal TBB -1000 liters today.
4. Hold off on anti-hypertensives and restart BB & ACE when BP tolerates and off pressors.
5. Change abx to vanco, zosyn, levofloxacin.
6. Wean supplemental O2 to home requirement 2-3L.
7. Daily weight check, free water restriction (1L).
8. Hold off on steroids for now.
9. Continue ASA, plavix, statin.
10. Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
11. Trend Cr.

   shock in setting of volume overload.  However, CXR today more
   concerning for both overload and PNA.  Also, his exam suggests
   bronchospasm with wheeze.
   1.       Respiratory Failure:  COPD, also concern for PNA and volume
   overload

   -          Increase nebulizers to q4h and prn
   -          Antibiotics noted below
   -          Might require NIPPV if retaining
   2.       Hypotension:  Unclear etiology, component of cardiogenic and
   possible septic shock.
   -          will continue dobutamine and dopamine
   -          Discuss with cardiology the significance of the TTE results

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of CHF and valvular disease, admitted with hypotension and hypoxemia due to fluid overload. The patient has undergone several interventions, including weaning of inotropes and diuresis with Lasix, but his condition has remained stable.

The patient's vital signs are concerning, with a blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg and a central venous pressure of 7 mmHg. His cardiac output is also decreased, with a Cvo2 of 70%. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a SpO2 of 96% and an ABG of 29/29.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and diminished breath sounds anteriorly, suggesting bronchospasm. The patient's mental status is obtunded and disoriented, and he is not following commands.

The patient's lab results are concerning, with an elevated troponin level and a decreased hemoglobin level. The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 2.5 to 2.1 mg/dL, suggesting a cardiogenic component to the patient's kidney failure.

The patient's imaging studies are concerning, with a CXR suggesting a right lower lobe infiltrate and gross volume overload.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to COPD, PNA, and volume overload. The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, but may be due to cardiogenic and possible septic shock. The patient's sepsis is likely due to a urinary tract infection, as evidenced by the patient's UA+.

The patient's potential medical complications include further decline in respiratory status, worsening of hypotension, and development of septic shock. The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, steroids, and diuretics, as well as further evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further decline in his condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and hypoxemia due to cardiogenic shock and fluid overload. He has a history of chronic heart failure and valvular disease. The patient's condition has worsened, with a decreasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a Cvo2 > 70%. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed worsening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with inferior and inferolateral segment hypokinesis. The patient has been receiving dopamine and dobutamine infusions, as well as diuretic therapy with lasix. He has also been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing and diminished breath sounds anteriorly, with distant heart sounds and displaced point of maximal impulse.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 171 x 10^9/L, and a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 29 mg/dL, and his serum albumin level is 2.1 g/dL. The patient's imaging studies show a suggestion of right lower lobe and middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, as well as gross volume overload.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's wheezing and diminished breath sounds suggest bronchospasm, which may worsen his respiratory failure. He may require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and steroids to manage his bronchospasm.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, septic shock, or a combination of both. His blood pressure may require further management with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
3. Infection: The patient's cultures are negative, but his CXR suggests an infiltrate, and his UA is positive. He may require further antibiotics and coverage for gram-negative and atypical organisms.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.1 mg/dL, and his BUN level is 29 mg/dL, suggesting worsening renal function. His diuresis may require further management with diuretics and fluid restriction.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he experiences an acute bleed. His Coumadin therapy may need to be held due to his elevated INR.
6. Sepsis: The patient's poor prognosis and the presence of an infiltrate on his CXR suggest the possibility of sepsis. He may require further antibiotics and supportive care to manage his sepsis.
7. Ischemic event: The patient's TTE results suggest worsening left ventricular function, which may be due to an ischemic event or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his cardiogenic shock."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and valvular disease, admitted to the ICU with hypotension and hypoxemia due to fluid overload. His cardiac output is compromised, as evident from a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (Cvo2 > 70%). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed worsening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with inferior and inferolateral segment hypokinesis. He has been receiving inotropes (dobutamine and dopamine) and diuretics (furosemide) to manage his condition.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure (BP) of 89/44 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 101 bpm. He has a respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 96% on 50% face mask oxygen. He has a temperature of 37.6°C and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.2 g/dL, and an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.5 K/uL. His creatinine (Cr) level has decreased from 2.5 to 2.1 mg/dL, suggesting a cardiogenic component. He has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.5, indicating therapeutic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's CXR shows a suggestion of right lower lobe (RLL) and right middle lobe (RML) infiltrate, which may be due to pneumonia (PNA) or volume overload. His exam suggests bronchospasm with wheeze, which may require additional respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, septic shock, or a combination of both. His TTE results suggest worsening LVEF, which may indicate a cardiogenic component. He will continue to receive dobutamine and dopamine to manage his blood pressure.
3. Infectious Disease: The patient's cultures are negative, but his CXR suggests an infiltrate. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is awaiting urine culture results. He is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for coverage, and will also receive levofloxacin for Gram-negative and atypical coverage.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's Cr level has decreased from 2.5 to 2.1 mg/dL, suggesting a cardiogenic component. His creatinine clearance may be compromised, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Heme Complications: The patient has anemia, which may be due to anemia of chronic disease. His hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, which may require transfusion. He is therapeutically anticoagulated for a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction, and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. He has a history of pulmonary embolism, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has been experiencing 4-5 days of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, which has worsened due to fluid overload. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a history. He has been made comfort measures only (CMO) and all interventions and treatments have been withdrawn except for those aimed at making the patient comfortable. The patient's family is aware and agreeable with the CMO status.

Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 66/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* SpO2: 98%

Lab Results:

* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 171 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 29 mEq/L
* Sodium: 136 mEq/L
* Potassium: 5.1 mEq/L
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL

Physical Examination:

* General appearance: sleeping and obtunded
* Eyes and conjunctiva: pupils are equal and reactive to light
* Cardiovascular: normal heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory: rhonchorous breath sounds, coarse
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: right and left radial pulses are present
* Skin: not assessed
* Neurologic: not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

Potential Medical Complications:

* Hypotension: may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal and hepatic failure
* Fluid overload: may lead to respiratory distress, cardiac failure, and electrolyte imbalances
* Respiratory failure: may lead to respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia
* Sepsis: may lead to multi-organ failure and death
* Cardiac failure: may lead to cardiogenic shock and death
* Pulmonary embolism: may lead to respiratory failure and death

Based on the patient's condition and lab results, it is likely that he is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction and is at risk for further complications. The patient's family has been informed and is aware of the CMO status, and all interventions and treatments have been withdrawn except for those aimed at making the patient comfortable."

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old man with a history of pulmonary embolism, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath and non-productive cough. He was made comfort measures only (CMO) yesterday, and all interventions and treatments were discontinued except for those aimed at making the patient comfortable. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving comfort measures only, including morphine sulfate infusion.

Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 66/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

Hemodynamic Monitoring:

* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg
* Mean arterial pressure (MAP): 66 mmHg
* Cardiac output (CO): not assessed
* Systemic vascular resistance (SVR): not assessed

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 171 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27.9 mg/dL
* Sodium (Na): 136 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.5 mEq/L
* Chloride (Cl): 97 mEq/L
* Calcium (Ca): 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 5.1 mg/dL
* Alanine transaminase (ALT): 19 IU/L

* Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos): 38 IU/L
* Total bilirubin (T Bili): 1.9 mg/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 164 IU/L

Potential Medical Complications:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to dehydration, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a low tidal volume, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient has a high creatinine level and is receiving fluid resuscitation, which may indicate renal failure.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a high sodium level and a low potassium level, which may indicate electrolyte imbalance.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a low blood pressure and a high heart rate, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic parameters closely.
* Administer fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain blood pressure.
* Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the tidal volume as needed.
* Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if sepsis is suspected.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and administer electrolyte supplements as needed.
* Consider consulting with a nephrologist or cardiologist if the patient's renal or cardiovascular function is deteriorating."
