You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch, 77-kg individual admitted to the ICU with a multi-lumen central line in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and their mixed venous oxygen saturation is 87%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.8-26.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4-12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 133-312 K/uL. The patient's blood chemistry results show a creatinine level of 0.7-1.1 mg/dL, and their glucose level is within a normal range.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are responding to verbal commands and have a stable neurological status. The patient's skin and peripheral vascular examination are not assessed.

The patient's multi-lumen central line was inserted on [**2192-8-27**] 05:19 AM and was found to be pulseless on medicine. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin and Amikacin on [**2192-8-25**] 08:37 AM.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's multi-lumen central line insertion and the presence of antibiotics may increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and central line placement may increase the risk of VTE.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory rate may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's pulseless status on medicine and bradycardic heart rate may indicate cardiovascular instability.
5. Infection: The patient's multi-lumen central line and the presence of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may indicate hemodynamic instability.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's limited physical examination and neurological status may indicate neurological complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   - suction, nebs prn
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - f/u pending cultures
   - consider bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and E.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   - restart metoprolol as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She presented from the medical floor after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for pulselessness and was found to be pulseless, ashen, and cool. She was intubated and received 1g epinephrine with CPR. She has been diagnosed with cardiopulmonary arrest, hypercarbic respiratory failure, HAP aspiration PNA, urosepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, and dementia. She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, IVF boluses to maintain urine output, and respiratory support with a ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Pulmonary Edema: The patient's underlying RLL infiltrate and pulmonary edema may continue to worsen, leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Mucous Plug: The patient's mucus plug may not be fully cleared, leading to recurring episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis and HAP aspiration PNA may lead to septic shock and organ failure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level of 1.1 may worsen, leading to further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to further cardiovascular complications.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, infections, and other complications.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
8. Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI): The patient's multi-lumen central line may increase the risk of CLABSI.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support with a ventilator and monitor for signs of worsening pulmonary edema.
2. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP aspiration PNA and urosepsis, and consider bronchoscopy and repeat sputum and blood cultures.
3. Monitor creatinine levels and consider dialysis if levels continue to worsen.
4. Monitor blood pressure and consider restarting metoprolol as tolerated.
5. Continue namenda and aricept for dementia.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ failure.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and bowel regimen to prevent complications.
8. Monitor for signs of VAP and CLABSI, and consider changing the patient's antibiotic regimen if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   - suction, nebs prn
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - f/u pending cultures
   - consider bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and E.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   - restart metoprolol as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presented to the ICU after cardiopulmonary arrest and was intubated. She has been diagnosed with E. coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration pneumonia. She has underlying respiratory failure, acute kidney failure, and hypertension. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been on ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's RLL infiltrate on CT scan and positive cultures suggest ongoing pneumonia, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level of 1.1 is a concern, and further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further decline in lung function.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further complications.
5. Urosepsis: The patient's E. coli urosepsis may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further complications.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent further decline in cognitive function.
7. Tube Feeding: The patient's tube feeding may require further monitoring and adjustment to prevent complications.
8. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk for VTE and may require further prophylaxis.
9. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers and may require further prophylaxis.
10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient may be at risk for VAP and may require further monitoring and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Given the fact that patient  quickly regained
   rhythm/pulse after intubation and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR and in setting
   of underlying RLL infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on
   the floor, most likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   There were no changes on EKG to support a cardiac origin of the arrest.
   -support with ventilation
   - treat underlying cause of PNA
   -IVF as needed
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient essentially failed
   extubation trial since [**8-24**]. Now s/p intubation with resolution in
   hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug and
   pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Mucus plug could have been
   dislodged during intubation which would speak to her rapid recovery
   post-intubation (as opposed to a cardiac origin). Given 40mg IV lasix
   with mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung
   exam. Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 today, try PS as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   - suction, nebs prn
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days. Also
   would benefit from bronchoscopy to further evaluate infectious
   etiology. Patient is at high risk of aspiration as well given her
   history of CVA and baseline mental status.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - consider bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and E.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate antibiotics since
   [**8-24**], will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin to complete course, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   -          restart metoprolol as tolerated
   -          hold lisinopril
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely due to a mucus plug and pulmonary edema, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a persistent RLL infiltrate on CT scan, which may indicate a bacterial or fungal infection. This could lead to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
3. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and UTI, which could lead to further kidney damage and sepsis.
4. Acute kidney failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.1 from a baseline of 0.6, which may indicate prerenal failure due to hypotension. This could lead to further kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular complications, and may also lead to further cognitive decline.
7. Aspiration: The patient's history of CVA and baseline mental status make her at high risk for aspiration, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
8. Sepsis: The patient's underlying infections, such as the E. coli bacteremia and UTI, may lead to further sepsis, which could exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Ventilation support to manage her hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotics to treat her underlying infections, including the E. coli bacteremia and UTI.
3. Fluid management to manage her acute kidney failure and prerenal failure.
4. Cardiovascular support to manage her hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Dementia management to manage her cognitive decline and prevent further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
6. Aspiration prevention to prevent further respiratory complications.
7. Sepsis management to prevent further sepsis and its complications.

The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, with possible transfer to the floor tomorrow."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - consider reeval w/ bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum cultures
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: W. e.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   - restart metoprolol as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. The patient presented from the medical floor after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for pulselessness.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.7Â°C, HR: 83 bpm, BP: 99/47 mmHg, RR: 16 breaths/min, SpO2: 100%
* Respiratory support: Intubated and ventilated with FiO2 100% and PEEP 5 cmH2O

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history include:

* Worsening respiratory failure due to continued pulmonary edema and mucus plug
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation
* Further deterioration of acute kidney failure due to continued hypovolemia and potential prerenal etiology
* Increased risk of sepsis and septic shock due to ongoing urosepsis and pneumonia
* Hypertensive crisis due to recent hypotensive episode and potential medication effects
* Dementia-related complications, such as increased agitation or respiratory instability, due to continued intubation and potential medication effects
* Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance due to inadequate nutrition and potential gastrointestinal dysfunction
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and potential hypercoagulability

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions, as well as prophylaxis for potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She was transferred to the medical floor and extubated, but later found pulseless and apneic, requiring reintubation. The patient has a history of breast cancer and has been experiencing fever, rising white blood cell count, and bandemia. She has ongoing findings consistent with persistent pneumonia and pneumonitis in the right middle and lower lobes.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Respiratory failure with hypercarbic respiratory arrest
* Pneumonia with consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes
* Leukocytosis with bandemia
* Acute renal failure
* Altered mental status
* Fever

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her conditions, including antibiotics, sedation, and respiratory support. The plan is to continue antibiotics for a 2-week course, change to pressure support ventilation and attempt to wean, and continue to follow CT scans to monitor clearance of the region.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia and pneumonitis may progress and lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen and lead to respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and death.
3. Acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis.
4. Leukocytosis and bandemia may indicate an underlying infection, which may spread to other parts of the body.
5. Altered mental status may worsen, leading to decreased level of consciousness, coma, and death.
6. Fever may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen and lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.

The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Chest x-ray from yesterday -
   ETT tip is hard to localize, may be 8 mm above the carina but should be
   further evaluated in a more standard position if of any clinical
   concern.
   Right PICC was installed, probably in good position. A nasogastric tube
   ends
   in the stomach. Right internal jugular catheter was removed.
   No overall change in large mass effect at the right hilar and
   infrahilar
   regions and left basilar consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Will wean oxygen as tolerated.
   Likely secondary to cardiopulonary arrest.
   - intubated, currently on pressure support of [**9-9**]. last rsbi > 100, so
   unlikely ready for extubation today, will continue to monitor
   -          will plan to wean fi02 today to 40% (from 50%)
   -          weak cough, no gag
   -          also suspect that extrapulmonary source of respiratory
   stable
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 7 day course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, still
   currently 1.1. Had been >2 on initial presentation and was improving
   prior to arrest.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   -          continue namenda and aricept

   also a component of acute cerebral insult secondary to cardiopulmonary
   arrest that has likely

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis. She had a recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and was intubated. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being treated for underlying causes of her respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiopulmonary arrest: The patient's recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and cardiac arrest may have caused permanent damage to her heart and lungs, leading to long-term complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to her cardiopulmonary arrest and may require long-term mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury, which may be due to prerenal causes, such as hypoperfusion, or postrenal causes, such as obstruction.
4. Urosepsis: The patient's UTI and sepsis may lead to further complications, such as septic shock, if not properly treated.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, including adjustments to her medication regimen.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen if not properly managed, and her recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness may have caused further cognitive decline.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness may have caused gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. Infection: The patient's recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and sepsis may have caused an infection, which may require further treatment.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and cardiopulmonary arrest may have caused cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
10. Pulmonary complications: The patient's recent episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and respiratory failure may have caused pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical team should closely monitor her condition and manage her complications accordingly. Further testing, such as echocardiography and pulmonary function tests, may be necessary to determine the extent of her cardiac and pulmonary damage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Will wean oxygen as tolerated.
   Likely secondary to cardiopulonary arrest.
   - intubated, currently on pressure support of [**9-9**]. last rsbi > 100, so
   unlikely ready for extubation today, will continue to monitor
   -          will plan to wean fi02 today to 40% (from 50%)
   -          weak cough, no gag
   -          also suspect that extrapulmonary source of respiratory
   stable
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis. She was previously in the MICU for E. coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She presented from the medical floor after a likely PEA arrest and is currently intubated and on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a persistent RLL infiltrate on chest x-ray and a positive Gram stain for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate, elevated creatinine, and a new band on differential. She is currently being treated for HAP/Aspiration PNA, sepsis, and urosepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on pressure support, but her RSBI is still elevated, suggesting that she may not be ready for extubation yet. She also has a weak cough and no gag reflex, which increases her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of acute kidney injury. She is currently being treated with furosemide to manage fluid overload, but her creatinine level may continue to rise if her kidney function does not improve.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with lisinopril. Her blood pressure is still elevated, and she may need further adjustments to her medication regimen to manage her blood pressure.
4. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia and is currently intubated without the need for sedative medications. She may be at risk for further cognitive decline due to her underlying condition and the stress of her current illness.
5. Infection: The patient has a persistent RLL infiltrate on chest x-ray and a positive Gram stain for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but she may be at risk for further infection if her underlying condition is not managed effectively.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and has experienced a PEA arrest. She may be at risk for further cardiovascular instability if her underlying condition is not managed effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's HAP/Aspiration PNA, sepsis, and urosepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her fluid management regimen as needed.
4. Adjust the patient's hypertension medication regimen as needed to manage her blood pressure.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cognitive status and adjust her medication regimen as needed to manage her dementia.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's underlying condition, including a thorough review of her medical history and a comprehensive physical examination."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   will draw troponins now
   - lactate rising
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Will wean oxygen as tolerated.
   Likely secondary to cardiopulonary arrest.
   - intubated, currently on pressure support of [**9-9**]. last rsbi > 100, so
   unlikely ready for extubation today, will continue to monitor
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - consider reeval w/ bronchoscopy/BAL to continue infectious workup
   - repeat sputum cultures
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: W. e.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 7 day course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, still
   currently 1.1. Had been >2 on initial presentation and was improving
   prior to arrest.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol
   - resume as HR and BP tolerate
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis. She had a recent episode of cardiopulmonary arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and has a PICC line in place. Her laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, acute kidney failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to underlying cardiac disease or hypoperfusion
	* Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Respiratory failure due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other lung disease
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema or hemorrhage due to hypoperfusion or sepsis
	* Seizures or altered mental status due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury due to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or medication toxicity
	* Chronic kidney disease progression
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections
	* Infection-related organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory, cardiac, or neurological)
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to underlying disease or medication side effects
	* Constipation or bowel obstruction due to medication side effects or underlying disease
7. Other Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to medication side effects or underlying disease
	* Electrolyte imbalances due to underlying disease or medication side effects

The patient's ongoing management should focus on addressing these potential complications, including optimizing her respiratory and cardiovascular status, managing her infections, and monitoring her renal and neurological function."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female now with recurrent respiratory failure while being cared
   for on the medical floor.  She had subsequent PEA arrest and successful
   resuscitation with intubation.  The concerning issue is that the
   primary insult is likely recurrent aspiration in the setting of
   incapacity to protect her airway in the setting of what is likley
   background levels of secretions and persistenly impaired mental
   status.  We have not identified a new fully reversible insult and would
   expect her to remain at risk for acute respiratory failure going
   forward.
   1)Respiratory Failure Acute-
   -Will keep fluid balance negative
   -Avoid sedating medications
   -Persistent secretions noted with frequent suctioning
   -Will continue with antibiotics--Amikacin/Flagyl/Levofloxacin/Vanco
   -Barriers to extubation are primarily impaired mental status which has
   worsened following arrest event with persistent dense impairment of
   sensorium.  This is in addition to her pulmonary secretions.
   -Will need to clarify goals of care with family prior to extubation
   attempt.
   2)Anemia-Does have an acute change and will need to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, who had a subsequent PEA arrest and was successfully resuscitated with intubation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 150/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 100%
* Oxygen delivery device: Endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CPAP/PSV
* FiO2: 50%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1, distant S2
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, and diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender
* Extremities: Right and left radial and digital pulses are absent
* Neurologic: Responds to noxious stimuli, but has no response to verbal stimulation

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 24.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 548 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.10 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 4.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 256 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL

Radiology reports show a CXR with lines in reasonable position, prominent right-sided infiltrate, and possible slight decrease in size of infiltrates.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Respiratory failure acute: Will keep fluid balance negative, avoid sedating medications, and continue with antibiotics. Barriers to extubation are primarily impaired mental status, which has worsened following the arrest event, and persistent pulmonary secretions.
* Anemia: Will need to repeat HCT today and consider OB stool.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for acute respiratory failure due to recurrent aspiration, impaired mental status, and persistent pulmonary secretions.
* Anemia: The patient has an acute change in anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and potential treatment options.
* Pneumonia: The CXR shows a prominent right-sided infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient has received antibiotics, and further evaluation is needed to determine if the patient has sepsis.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and is receiving SQ UF Heparin prophylaxis.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to intubation and is receiving HOB elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   # Urosepsis: W. e.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 7 day course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, still
   currently 1.1. Had been >2 on initial presentation and was improving
   prior to arrest.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          suspect that only only is there a component of dementia but
   also a component of acute cerebral insult secondary to cardiopulmonary
   arrest that has likely
   .
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6

   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, d/c bowel regimen in the setting of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   # Urosepsis: W. e.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 7 day course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, still
   currently 1.1. Had been >2 on initial presentation and was improving
   prior to arrest.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          suspect that only only is there a component of dementia but
   also a component of acute cerebral insult secondary to cardiopulmonary
   arrest that has likely
   .
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6
   .
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, d/c bowel regimen in the setting of
   persistent diarrhea, PPI
   .
   # Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**], will decide on trach in
   the morning
   .
   # Code: FC - plan to reassess with sister, suspect that this is likely

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E. coli urosepsis, Providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She presented from the medical floor after likely PEA arrest, now 48 hours after the event.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiopulmonary Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory failure caused by a pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic period). She received epinephrine and CPR, and her rhythm was restored.
* Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a high FiO2. She has significant secretions and requires frequent suctioning.
* HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis: The patient has a persistent RLL infiltrate on CT, and her CBC shows new bands on the differential. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her clinical response has been poor.
* Urosepsis: The patient has W. e. coli bacteremia and e. coli/providencia UTI, and repeat cultures have been negative.
* Acute Kidney Failure: The patient's creatinine is 1.1, and she is currently volume overloaded, likely due to poor forward flow.
* Hypertension: The patient is on lisinopril and metoprolol as an outpatient, and she will be restarted on lisinopril today, with titration as tolerated.
* Dementia: The patient is currently intubated without the need for sedative medications, and she is being treated with namenda and aricept.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
* Sepsis: The patient's HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis can progress, leading to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney failure can worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension can worsen, leading to hypertensive crisis and potential cardiac complications.
* Dementia-related complications: The patient's dementia can worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, infections, and other complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning from mechanical ventilation and extubation, pending further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure.
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis.
* Monitoring and managing her acute kidney failure, with goal I/O of negative 1 liter per day.
* Restarting lisinopril and uptitrating as tolerated for hypertension.
* Continuing treatment for dementia with namenda and aricept.
* Monitoring for and managing potential complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and hypertensive crisis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male, intubated and sedated, with a history of respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient received 40mg IV lasix with good urine output (approx 500cc) and had medications changed to PO if possible to avoid excess urine and decreased free water flushes with TFs. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and amikacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, with normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction put him at risk for further complications, including septicemia, organ failure, and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is critical, and any changes in ventilation or oxygenation could lead to further deterioration.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest potential kidney damage, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, are within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient's ongoing antibiotic therapy and potential presence of sepsis increase the risk of developing new infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Thrombosis: The patient's risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) is high due to his immobility and ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ongoing sedation and intubation increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including aspiration, ileus, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3
   more days)
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND

   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, currently
   on CVVH.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head as above
   .
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3
   more days)
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   - f/u amikacin levels this morning
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, currently
   on CVVH.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head as above
   .
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She presents with worsening mental status, likely due to a recent cardiopulmonary arrest, and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of E.coli bacteremia and UTI, and repeat cultures have been negative. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

The patient has developed acute kidney failure, with a creatinine level of 1.1 from a baseline of 0.6. She is currently on CVVH, although this is an error and should be disregarded. She is also experiencing hypertension, which is being managed with lisinopril and metoprolol.

The patient has a history of dementia and is currently intubated without the need for sedative medications. There is concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest that may be causing her apnea.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with frequent suctioning and nebulization as needed. She is also experiencing episodes of apnea while on PS, which is being treated with oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 2.6.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, managing her hypertension, and monitoring her respiratory status. She will also be evaluated for possible tracheostomy and weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's E.coli bacteremia and UTI could lead to sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's current kidney function is abnormal, and further deterioration could lead to chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's apneic episodes and hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen her respiratory status, leading to further respiratory failure.
4. Cerebral ischemic insult: The patient's history of dementia and possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest could worsen her cognitive function.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen her cardiovascular status, leading to further cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's history of UTI and E.coli bacteremia could lead to further infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E. coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She presents with worsening mental status, apnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 24.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.0 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 666 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 256 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Cardiopulmonary arrest: The patient had a likely PEA arrest 48 hours prior to admission, which was treated with intubation and epinephrine.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic period).
* HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: The patient has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E. coli in blood and urine, indicating a severe infection.
* Urosepsis: The patient has E. coli bacteremia and UTI.
* Acute kidney failure: The patient has acute kidney failure, likely due to prerenal etiology secondary to episode of hypoperfusion.
* Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with lisinopril and metoprolol.
* Dementia: The patient has dementia, which may be causing her apnea.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Sepsis: The patient's severe infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
* Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may lead to hypertensive crisis, which can cause cardiovascular complications.
* Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration PNA may progress to pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure and sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3 more days.
* Wean FiO2 as tolerated and consider tracheostomy.
* Monitor electrolytes and replete potassium aggressively.
* Trend creatinine and consider discontinuing CVVH if kidney function improves.
* Restart lisinopril and uptitrate as tolerated.
* Continue namenda and aricept for dementia.
* Consider CT head to evaluate for possible cerebral ischemic insult.

The patient's disposition is ICU care for now, with plans to reassess with her sister today."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3
   more days)
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - f/u amikacin levels this morning
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6, currently
   on CVVH.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -          goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as
   needed to achieve this
   .
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - restart lisinopril today, uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          suspect that only only is there a component of dementia but
   also a component of acute cerebral insult secondary to cardiopulmonary
   arrest that has likely

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3
   more days)
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
      CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E. coli urosepsis, Providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She was transferred to the ICU from the medical floor after likely PEA arrest, now 48 hours after the event. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with cardiopulmonary arrest, hypercarbic respiratory failure, HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis, urosepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, dementia, and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for further respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheal stenosis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is also unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac events, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute kidney failure is likely to worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's septicemia and pneumonia are at risk of progression, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's dementia and potential acute cerebral insult from cardiopulmonary arrest may lead to further cognitive decline, increased risk of falls, and potential need for further neuroimaging studies.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's persistent diarrhea and potential bowel obstruction may lead to further electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and potential need for surgical intervention.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's anemia and potential bleeding diathesis may lead to further complications, including hypovolemic shock and potential need for transfusions.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's hypokalemia and potential electrolyte imbalances may lead to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potential need for further electrolyte repletion.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Consider further cardiac testing, including echocardiogram and stress test, to assess cardiac function and potential need for further interventions.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management and diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's septicemia and pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider further imaging studies to guide therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further neuroimaging studies to assess potential acute cerebral insult.
6. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms with antidiarrheal agents and consider further imaging studies to rule out bowel obstruction.
7. Monitor the patient's hematological status closely and consider further transfusions if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's metabolic status closely and adjust electrolyte repletion as needed.

By closely monitoring the patient's condition and addressing potential complications promptly, the patient's outcome can be improved, and further morbidity and mortality can be reduced."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with recurrent acute respiratory failure in the setting of
   persistent dementia, secretions and incapacity to maintain patent
   airway and management of secretions.  She has had persistent
   ventilatory requirement and limited improvement in mental status.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Continue with PSV support
   -Patient with continued oral secretions and incapacity to maintain gag
   reflex to prevent ongoing large volume of aspiration
   -Mental status remains primary barrier to extubation
   -Will need to consider goals of care prior to decision to extubate as
   risk factors for acute respiratory failure are persistent.
   2)Alteration of Awareness-
   -Concern for persistent dense imparied sensorium
will pursue CT head
   -No sedation given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Continue with PSV support
   -Patient with continued oral secretions and incapacity to maintain gag
   reflex to prevent ongoing large volume of aspiration
   -Mental status remains primary barrier to extubation
   -Will need to consider goals of care prior to decision to extubate as
   risk factors for acute respiratory failure are persistent.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU due to persistent acute respiratory failure, recurrent fevers, and an inability to maintain a patent airway. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and has had multiple antibiotics administered. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 360 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent fevers and opacities in the right lung basal segments on CXR suggest a possible pneumonia. Further investigation with a chest CT scan and bronchoscopy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to maintain a patent airway and her oral secretions put her at risk for aspiration. Close monitoring of her airway and secretion management is essential to prevent this complication.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and inadequate lung expansion may increase her risk for VAP. Strict adherence to VAP prevention measures, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing daily wake-up tests, and ensuring proper mouth care, is crucial.
4. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent fevers and leukocytosis suggest a possible sepsis. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's persistent dense impaired sensorium and inability to respond to noxious stimuli may indicate neurological deterioration. Further investigation with a CT head scan and neurology consultation may be necessary to determine the cause of her neurological status.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased sensation may put her at risk for pressure ulcers. Close monitoring of her skin and proper pressure ulcer prevention measures, such as turning and repositioning, are essential.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase her risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as SQ UF heparin, should be continued to prevent DVT.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation support with close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status.
2. Perform a chest CT scan to investigate the opacities in the right lung basal segments.
3. Consider bronchoscopy to further investigate the patient's respiratory status.
4. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider a CT head scan and neurology consultation if necessary.
6. Implement pressure ulcer prevention measures, such as turning and repositioning.
7. Continue prophylactic measures for DVT, such as SQ UF heparin."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND

   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril todya
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head as above
   - history of CVA - for secondary stroke prevention should be on aspirin
   and statin; currently on neither one will start statin today, listed as
   having aspirin allergy of unknown type in the chart, however on
   previous admissions appears to have taken it so will consider
   restarting it, although utility at this point given mental status
   likely low

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND

   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril todya
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head as above
   - history of CVA - for secondary stroke prevention should be on aspirin
   and statin; currently on neither one will start statin today, listed as
   having aspirin allergy of unknown type in the chart, however on
   previous admissions appears to have taken it so will consider
   restarting it, although utility at this point given mental status
   likely low

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was transferred to the ICU after a PEA arrest on the medical floor. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a persistent RLL infiltrate on her chest X-ray and has grown GPC pairs/clusters in her sputum and E. coli in her blood and urine. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since admission and has had multiple blood cultures, including one that grew E. coli.

The patient's condition has been stable, but she has had episodes of apnea while on PS. Her lactate levels have been trending upwards, and she has had a CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her apneic periods. She has also had a respiratory culture that showed no growth.

The patient's labs are notable for a creatinine of 1.1, which is an increase from her baseline of 0.6. Her electrolytes are abnormal, with a potassium level of 2.6, which was repleted aggressively this morning. Her magnesium and phosphorus levels are also abnormal.

The patient's medications include scopolamine patch for secretions, TCA for sedation, and lasix for diuresis. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin and PPI.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's E. coli bacteremia and UTI may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen, leading to decreased cognitive function and increased risk of falls.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to decreased muscle mass and increased risk of complications.
7. Infection: The patient's persistent RLL infiltrate may lead to infection, which could worsen her condition.
8. Bleeding: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies may lead to bleeding complications.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's abnormal cardiac rhythm may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
    # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
         CLUSTERS.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
   .- only positive blood culture so far from [**8-17**] - ESCHERICHIA COLI

   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril today to 10
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .# Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative
   medications. No evidence of acute infarct on CT however suspect global
   anoxia as metabolic insult.
   - d/c namenda and aricept as likely not helpful anymore
   -
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6, K now 4.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
    # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
         CLUSTERS.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].

   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril today to 10
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .# Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative
   medications. No evidence of acute infarct on CT however suspect global
   anoxia as metabolic insult.
   - d/c namenda and aricept as likely not helpful anymore
   -

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presented to the ICU with urosepsis and pneumonia. She was initially intubated and received epinephrine with CPR after a likely PEA arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with HAP/Aspiration PNA, sepsis, and acute kidney failure.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is tachypneic and has diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. She is not a candidate for extubation today.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has a history of hypertension. She is receiving prophylactic heparin.
* Neurological: The patient has worsening mental status and does not respond to verbal or physical stimuli. She has no spontaneous movement appreciated.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney failure, and her creatinine level is 1.1. She is receiving furosemide and has a goal of negative 1 liter per day of fluid output.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally may indicate worsening respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and continues to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1, and she is receiving furosemide to manage her fluid output.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving prophylactic heparin.
* Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia and is currently intubated without sedative medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and will be weaned off FIO2 as tolerated.
* Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics for her HAP/Aspiration PNA and sepsis.
* Renal management: The patient will continue to receive furosemide to manage her fluid output and will have her creatinine level trended.
* Cardiovascular management: The patient will continue to receive prophylactic heparin and will have her blood pressure monitored.
* Neurological management: The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in her mental status or neurological function.

The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been given the option to come and visit her. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently receiving ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with persistent and recurrent respiratory failure in the
   setting of altered mental status and aspiration and recurrent
   respiratory failure.  She has failed to have any significant
   improvement in mental status to the point of being able to reasonably
   consider extubation.  In addition there has been a significant decrease
   in alertness and inability to establish response to even painful
   stimuli at this point.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Acute and Chronic-
   -PSV to continue for support as patient unable to support ventilation
   independently
   -Vanco/Amikacin/Flagyl
   2)Alteration of Awareness-
   -Medications in place
   -Will have to consider complete absence of meaningful improvement and
   with persistent absence of responsiveness that patient is likely to
   remain in this persistent state without reasonable expectation of
   meaningful improvement.
   3)Disposition---Family meeting needed and scheduled for today to
   discuss plan of care in the setting of current comatose state.  Current
   clinical decline would suggest that DNR status at a minimum is
   suggested to family in addition to consideration of CMO status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with persistent and recurrent respiratory failure in the
   setting of altered mental status and aspiration and recurrent
   respiratory failure.  She has failed to have any significant
   improvement in mental status to the point of being able to reasonably
   consider extubation.  In addition there has been a significant decrease
   in alertness and inability to establish response to even painful
   stimuli at this point.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Acute and Chronic-
   -PSV to continue for support as patient unable to support ventilation
   independently
   -Vanco/Amikacin/Flagyl
   2)Alteration of Awareness-
   -Medications in place
   -Will have to consider complete absence of meaningful improvement and
   with persistent absence of responsiveness that patient is likely to
   remain in this persistent state without reasonable expectation of
   meaningful improvement.
   3)Disposition---Family meeting needed and scheduled for today to
   discuss plan of care in the setting of current comatose state.  Current
   clinical decline would suggest that DNR status at a minimum is
   suggested to family in addition to consideration of CMO status

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and decreased responsiveness. The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, with increasing tachypnea and minimal response to painful stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate acid levels. The CT head scan revealed no acute infarct or bleeding.

The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 312 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 47 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 163 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination shows a thin patient with endotracheal tube in place, symmetric chest expansion, and dullness to percussion. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the extremities show mild edema.

The patient's medical history includes a history of aspiration, recurrent respiratory failure, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, penicillins, and Bactrim.

The patient's current medications include scopalamine patch, TCA, furosemide, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and the patient may require ongoing ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and increased lactate acid levels suggest the possibility of infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's encephalopathy and decreased responsiveness may be related to sepsis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and encephalopathy may be related to pneumonia.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's decreased blood pressure and increased lactate acid levels suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability.
6. Renal failure: The patient's decreased hemoglobin and increased lactate acid levels suggest the possibility of renal failure.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate acid levels suggest the possibility of metabolic acidosis.

Given the patient's condition, the patient's family should be informed of the potential risks and complications and the need for ongoing ventilatory support. The patient's code status should be discussed with the family, and the possibility of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status should be considered."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 77 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis unknown at this time. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 157/66 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95% and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis or inflammatory response. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits, but the patient's serum potassium level is slightly elevated.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the presence of endotracheal tube and other invasive lines. The patient's neurologic examination is also limited due to the patient's altered mental status.

The patient's medical history is significant for a history of penicillin allergy and rash with Bactrim use. The patient has also received antibiotics, including levofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and amikacin.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure if the underlying cause of the patient's respiratory distress is not addressed.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated heart rate and blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including tachycardia and hypertension.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal dysfunction, which can worsen if the patient's blood pressure is not controlled.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's altered mental status and limited neurologic examination may indicate neurologic complications, including cerebral edema or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - family said patient is now DNR/DNI
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
    .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril today to 10
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .# Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative
   medications. No evidence of acute infarct on CT however suspect global
   anoxia as metabolic insult.
   - d/c namenda and aricept as likely not helpful anymore
   -
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6, K now 4.4
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, d/c bowel regimen in the setting of
   persistent diarrhea, PPI
   .
   # Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**].
   # Code: Plan. Now DNR/DNI. Plan to extubate today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - family said patient is now DNR/DNI
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
    .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril today to 10
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .# Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative
   medications. No evidence of acute infarct on CT however suspect global
   anoxia as metabolic insult.
   - d/c namenda and aricept as likely not helpful anymore
   -
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6, K now 4.4
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, d/c bowel regimen in the setting of
   persistent diarrhea, PPI
   .
   # Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**].

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, hypercarbic, and likely not a candidate for extubation today. She has been intubated twice and is requiring frequent suctioning. Her mental status has worsened since her previous transfer, and she is now DNR/DNI. She has a history of urosepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, dementia, and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires frequent suctioning.
2. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of E.coli urosepsis, and her current antibiotic regimen may not be effective in eradicating the infection.
3. Acute Kidney Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1, and she is likely experiencing relative hypoperfusion. Her kidney function may continue to deteriorate if not managed properly.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and she is at risk of developing complications such as cardiac failure and stroke.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia is likely to worsen if not managed properly, and she may experience further decline in her cognitive function.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and she is at risk of developing further complications if not managed properly.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and frequent suctioning.
2. Review and adjust the patient's antibiotic regimen to ensure that it is effective in eradicating the urosepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider adjusting her fluid management and diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medication and monitor her blood pressure closely.
5. Consider consulting with a neurologist to manage the patient's dementia and prevent further decline in her cognitive function.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of aspiration pneumonia and consider adjusting her feeding regimen as needed.
7. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to manage the patient's VAP and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch-tall male who weighs 77 kg, admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has received various antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Amikacin, as well as other medications such as Lansoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and Furosemide.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 157/66 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, with a WBC of 20.2 K/uL and a platelet count of 875 K/uL. His hemoglobin (Hb) level is 8.7 g/dL, and his creatinine (Cr) level is 1.0 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.10 ng/mL, and his lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of various systems, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and abdominal.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's elevated WBC and platelet count, as well as the presence of multiple antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory status due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, given the patient's elevated troponin-T level.
4. Renal failure or worsening renal function due to the patient's elevated creatinine level.
5. Hemodynamic instability or shock due to the patient's elevated lactate level and potential development of sepsis or septic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, given the patient's use of anticoagulant medications and potential development of stress ulcer.
7. Infection or sepsis due to the patient's presence of central venous catheters and potential development of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with persistent respiratory failure in the setting of
   altered mental status with persistent and severe dementia and inability
   to maintain oral secreations.  She has had no findings to suggest new
   insult in CNS imaging despite worsening and persistent decline in
   responsiveness.  There is no reasonable expectation of a meaningful
   recovery based upon the patient's goals of care as expressed through
   her family and primarily through the health care proxy.  In this
   setting the patient has had continued venilatory support and discussion
   of the goals of care.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Amikacin/Levoflox/Flacyl
   -Maintain ventilatory support as patient unable to protect airway
   -She has increase in level of ventilatory support
   -Will move towards extubation and CMO as plan of care after family has
   had opportunity to finalize disussion and health care proxy status
   confirmed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with persistent respiratory failure in the setting of
   altered mental status with persistent and severe dementia and inability
   to maintain oral secreations.  She has had no findings to suggest new
   insult in CNS imaging despite worsening and persistent decline in
   responsiveness.  There is no reasonable expectation of a meaningful
   recovery based upon the patient's goals of care as expressed through
   her family and primarily through the health care proxy.  In this
   setting the patient has had continued venilatory support and discussion
   of the goals of care.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Amikacin/Levoflox/Flacyl
   -Maintain ventilatory support as patient unable to protect airway
   -She has increase in level of ventilatory support
   -Will move towards extubation and CMO as plan of care after family has
   had opportunity to finalize disussion and health care proxy status
   confirmed

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with persistent respiratory failure, altered mental status, and severe dementia. She is intubated and requires ventilatory support. Despite no new findings on CNS imaging, her responsiveness has worsened, and there is no reasonable expectation of a meaningful recovery based on her goals of care. The patient's family and healthcare proxy have been discussing her goals of care, and the plan is to maintain ventilatory support and potentially move towards extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) after the family has finalized their discussion and healthcare proxy status is confirmed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing VAP, which could further complicate her condition.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to maintain oral secretions and altered mental status increase her risk of aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged antibiotic course and underlying respiratory failure make her susceptible to sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's increasing level of ventilatory support and respiratory failure may indicate a worsening of her underlying condition, which could lead to further complications.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's worsening responsiveness and lack of meaningful recovery suggest a high risk of neurological deterioration, which could lead to a poor quality of life and increased morbidity.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac complications.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines increase her risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, which could lead to further complications."
