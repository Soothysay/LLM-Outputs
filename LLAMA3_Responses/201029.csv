   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   .
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, hypercalcemia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit.  Pt now s/p 5.5L
   IVF and BP stable with MAPs in the 60
s-70
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - Started on Vanc/Zosyn last night after no clinical improvement from
   IVF boluses
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose, although patient has been unable to take
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush, making
   esophageal candidiasis most likely, also on ddx includes viral
   esophagitis (CMV, HSV).  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest not
   showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.
   -check CMV Ab and VL, HSV Ab
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   .
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca = 11.6, only mildly elevated for this
   patient, who has been admitted with ca as high as 19 in the past.
   -Hydrate as above
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer, metastatic to bone and liver, presenting with dysphagia and hypotension. The patient has a history of poor oral intake, hypercalcemia, diuretic use, high BUN/Cr ratio, and hyponatremia, which may contribute to her hypotension.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy, rather than hypoperfusion from hypotension, infection, hypercalcemia, or brain metastases. The patient's dysphagia is likely caused by esophageal candidiasis, which is being treated with fluconazole.

The patient's hypercalcemia is a recurrent problem, and hydration and monitoring are ongoing. The patient's liver failure is being managed with lactulose and aggressive nutrition.

The patient has been started on Vanc/Zosyn for suspected infection/sepsis, and blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient is also being treated for candidal esophagitis and hypercalcemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infection/sepsis: The patient is immunocompromised and has a history of poor oral intake, which may increase the risk of infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may worsen, leading to increased risk of encephalopathy.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen, leading to further complications.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory rate may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver failure and portal hypertension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor oral intake and liver failure may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the bone and liver, presenting with dysphagia and hypotension. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to dehydration, diuretic use, and hyponatremia, with a possibility of infection or sepsis given the patient's immunocompromised state. The patient is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, and the plan is to continue IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-70 mmHg.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy, with less likely causes being hypoperfusion, infection, hypercalcemia, or brain metastases. The plan is to hold dilaudid for now and use 0.25mg doses as needed, and to consider adjunct pain medication and lactulose to improve mental status.

The patient's dysphagia is likely due to esophageal candidiasis, with a possibility of viral esophagitis (CMV, HSV). The plan is to treat with fluconazole and consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.

The patient's liver failure is likely due to extensive liver metastases, with no evidence of biliary obstruction on ultrasound. The plan is to aggressively manage nutrition and consider lactulose to improve liver function.

The patient's elevated coagulation factors are likely due to decreased synthetic function in the liver. The plan is to send DIC labs and evaluate possible contributions of lovenox and the patient's dose.

The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, which is a recurrent problem for this patient with widely metastatic cancer. The plan is to continue to monitor.

The patient is at risk for DVT and is receiving lovenox prophylaxis.

The patient's ICU care plan includes full liquids with supplements, nutrition consult pending, and advancement to pudding as tolerated. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and will have a head CT to evaluate for metastatic disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and potential infection or sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver failure and potential for further liver dysfunction.
3. Esophageal candidiasis: Given the patient's dysphagia and potential for further infection.
4. Hypercalcemia: Given the patient's history of hypercalcemia and potential for further calcium elevation.
5. DVT: Given the patient's risk factors for DVT and potential for further thrombotic events.
6. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's potential for further respiratory compromise and potential for further lung disease.
7. Cardiac failure: Given the patient's potential for further cardiac compromise and potential for further heart disease.
8. Renal failure: Given the patient's potential for further kidney dysfunction and potential for further kidney disease.

It is essential to continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer who has extensive metastatic
   disease with substantial liver involvement and compromised hepatic
   function who has come in with significant hypotension in the setting of
   dilaudid Rx for significant pain from esophagitis and mucositis
   presumed.  This, in the setting of significant compromise of hepatic
   function may well have contributed to persistent and significant
   altered mental status acros time.  Mental status has improved as
   dilaudid had been metabolized.  The hyptension has persisted and is
   within the range of where patient has been documented to be recently at
   home.  This is with improved mental status this morning.  She has
   persistent hypotension through to this morning but without obvious
   source for acute worsening of stability.  Investigation of the primary
   issue would suggest--preload has been repleted, sources of vasodilatory
   insult including adrenal failure, hypthyroidism and sepsis appear less
   likely.  We have the persistent and resting tacycardia likely
   represents cardiac compromise and does raise concern for possible
   compromise SV.  The issue may be patient with continued loss of
   intravascular volume.
   1)Hypotension-
   -Will have to evaluate ECHO today
   -Will have to fluid bolus as needed
   -Will need to finalize any culture results in regards to bacterial
   infection but do not have clear evidcence of it.
   -If ECHO reassuring will need to consider
intravascular volume
   depletion + effects of narcotics as most likely cause for hypotension
   and manage appropriately going forward
   2)Altered Mental Status-Much improved today with patient alert,

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer and extensive metastatic disease, including liver involvement and compromised hepatic function. The patient was admitted to the ICU with significant hypotension and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 125 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 94/68 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Soft, distended abdomen with no tenderness
* Right and left lower extremity edema (3+)
* No skin abnormalities
* Neurological examination shows the patient is not attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli, but has no movement or tone assessment due to sedation.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 14.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 150 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 85 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis is acute renal failure, acute hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition is likely related to her underlying cancer, compromised hepatic function, and potential cardiac compromise.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac compromise: The patient's persistent tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac compromise, which can lead to further deterioration of her condition.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing infections, which can be life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is slightly decreased, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's compromised hepatic function and potential malnutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, which can exacerbate her condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function
2. Fluid bolus as needed to manage hypotension
3. Monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis
4. Narcotic management to control pain and sedation
5. Nutrition support, including PO diet and potential parenteral nutrition
6. Glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia
7. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days given thrush on exam, now also on Ganciclovir since [**11-13**].
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit at admission.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - continue albumin dose at noon today, dose with spironolactone and
   lasix given peripheral edema
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
     Overall improved today, might be because of increased perfusion of
   prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some, continue
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -guiaic stools
   -active T&S
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca has normalized to 9.1
   -continue to monitor
   #.  DVT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the liver and bones, presenting with dysphagia, hypotension, and altered mental status. She has been experiencing suboptimal urine output, and her creatinine levels have been increasing. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and diuretics. Her condition has been complicated by liver failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status, seizures, and even coma.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating possible AKI, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even end-stage renal disease.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of CMV and candidal esophagitis increase her risk of developing sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level has normalized, but she may still be at risk of developing hypercalcemia due to her metastatic breast cancer.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and cancer diagnosis.
7. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of PE, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
9. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of CMV and candidal esophagitis increase her risk of developing infection.
10. Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive management of the patient's liver failure, including lactulose and albumin infusions.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels closely and consider initiating dialysis if necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics and antivirals as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to prevent further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider correcting any imbalances.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's acute kidney injury.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
9. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to further manage the patient's respiratory status.
10. Discuss the patient's level of care and possibility of hospice with her HCP and family."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Now on albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - consider d/c Vanc/Zosyn as CMV positive.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some
   - Will get CT head to evaluate for metastatic disease, as could  be
   causing altered mental status
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, consider
   CTA chest to r/o PE.
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.   Now CMV positive.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider d/c since now on treatment with Gangcylovir
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Now on albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - consider d/c Vanc/Zosyn as CMV positive.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.

   causing altered mental status
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, consider
   CTA chest to r/o PE.
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause

   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider d/c since now on treatment with Gangcylovir
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the bone and liver, presenting with dysphagia and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She has been treated with various medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and antivirals.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to dilaudid use, hepatic encephalopathy, or a combination of both. Further evaluation with a CT head is recommended to rule out metastatic disease.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachycardia may be secondary to intravascular depletion, and a CTA chest to rule out PE is recommended. Additionally, the patient's dysphagia may lead to respiratory complications, such as aspiration pneumonia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed promptly. Further evaluation with a renal ultrasound and monitoring of renal function is recommended.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may be a recurrent problem, and close monitoring is recommended to prevent further complications.
5. DVT: The patient's DVT may worsen if not managed promptly. Further evaluation with a CTA chest and monitoring of DVT is recommended.
6. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent use of antibiotics may increase her risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is recommended.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen if not managed promptly. Further evaluation with a liver biopsy and monitoring of liver function is recommended.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's dysphagia and thrush may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as esophagitis or gastritis. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory results is recommended.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple comorbidities to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   .
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  Pt now s/p 5.5L IVF and BP stable with MAPs in
   the 60
s-70
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Will give sodium bicarb in
   fluid if needs further fluid resuscitation
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now but may not need antibiotics if
   clinically improves and cultures negative, sepsis less likely at this
   time
   - Will triple home steroid dose to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   - TTE today to assess for pericardial effusion in setting of low
   voltage on ECG, hypotension, metastatic cancer
   - Can consider albumin to help keep fluids intravascularly
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose for a few doses to see if improves mental status
   - Will get CT head to evaluate for metastatic disease, as could  be
   causing altered mental status
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush, making
   esophageal candidiasis most likely, also on ddx includes viral
   esophagitis (CMV, HSV).  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest not
   showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.   Now CMV positive.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider change to gangciclovir or another [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the liver and bone, who has been admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of immunocompromise, including chemotherapy and steroids, and has recently received IV Ganciclovir for CMV positivity.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 113/63 mmHg, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-70 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg or higher.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy to maintain a SpO2 of 100%.
* Neurologic status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is expected to improve with lactulose treatment.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has dysphagia, which is likely due to esophageal candidiasis. The patient is receiving treatment with fluconazole.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.
* Hepatic status: The patient has hepatic failure, with elevated liver enzymes and total bilirubin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent IV Ganciclovir treatment make them susceptible to sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory support requirements increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic failure and altered mental status make them at risk for further hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ongoing fluid resuscitation increase the risk of further renal failure.
* DVT: The patient's immobilization and recent IV fluid administration increase the risk of DVT.
* GI bleeding: The patient's esophageal candidiasis and altered mental status increase the risk of GI bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg or higher.
* Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but may consider changing to a different antibiotic if cultures are negative.
* Hold diuresis for now and consider albumin administration to help maintain intravascular fluid volume.
* Continue lactulose treatment to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
* Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory failure.
* Consider stress dose steroids to manage adrenal insufficiency.
* Continue to monitor liver function tests and adjust treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now with presentation with
   significant hypotension in the setting of increased dosing of dilaudid
   needed for severe oral/esophageal pain which in the setting of
   significant hepatic dysfunction may have had prolonged effects and now
   with time patient has had substantial improvement in mental status and
   blood pressure and now is faced with modest persistent renal
   dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.  This has all trended
   to better with most prominent issue going forward working to establish
   a regimen to provide stability in regards to volume status with likely
   role for diuretics with caution given recent hypotension.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose
   -Dilaudid minimized
   -Blood pressure improved
   -Will continue to monitor exam but very reassuring now
   2)Hypotension-This is likely a combination of narcotics with extensive
   impact in the setting of ongoing difficulty with intravascular volume
   with hepatic failure.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
will D/C if cultures negative at 72 hours
   -Dex 12mg IV qd
   -Albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   -GCV in place
   -Will move to D/C albumin at 48 hours with hope for improved balance
   across time
   3)Oliguria-Patient has significant oliguria but preserved Creatinine
   levels
we have seen increase in urine output across time
   -Will continue with Albumin across time
   -Will move to standing diuretic starting at low dose
   4)CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**]
s input
   -Will work to discuss with family goals of her care and path to
   treatment from here
   5)Hepatic Failure-
   -Patient with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with
   mild persistent elevation of transaminases
   -Continue with lactulose
   -Will need to maintain
   6)Esophagitis-Likely a combination of fungal and viral contribution
   -Will continue with Fluconazole as well as gancyclovir
   -Local pain control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now with presentation with
   significant hypotension in the setting of increased dosing of dilaudid
   needed for severe oral/esophageal pain which in the setting of
   significant hepatic dysfunction may have had prolonged effects and now
   with time patient has had substantial improvement in mental status and
   blood pressure and now is faced with modest persistent renal
   dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.  This has all trended
   to better with most prominent issue going forward working to establish
   a regimen to provide stability in regards to volume status with likely
   role for diuretics with caution given recent hypotension.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose
   -Dilaudid minimized
   -Blood pressure improved
   -Will continue to monitor exam but very reassuring now
   2)Hypotension-This is likely a combination of narcotics with extensive
   impact in the setting of ongoing difficulty with intravascular volume
   with hepatic failure.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
will D/C if cultures negative at 72 hours
   -Dex 12mg IV qd
   -Albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   -GCV in place
   -Will move to D/C albumin at 48 hours with hope for improved balance
   across time
   3)Oliguria-Patient has significant oliguria but preserved Creatinine
   levels
we have seen increase in urine output across time
   -Will continue with Albumin across time
   -Will move to standing diuretic starting at low dose
   4)CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**]
s input
   -Will work to discuss with family goals of her care and path to
   treatment from here
   5)Hepatic Failure-
   -Patient with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with
   mild persistent elevation of transaminases
   -Continue with lactulose
   -Will need to maintain
   6)Esophagitis-Likely a combination of fungal and viral contribution
   -Will continue with Fluconazole as well as gancyclovir
   -Local pain control

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Volume Overload: The patient has extra-vascular volume overload, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory distress, and worsening of renal function.
2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with mild persistent elevation of transaminases, which can worsen liver function and increase the risk of bleeding, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has modest persistent renal dysfunction, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infections.
4. Infections: The patient has an elevated CMV viral load and is receiving antiviral medication, which can increase the risk of resistant infections.
5. Respiratory Distress: The patient has tachypnea and diminished breath sounds, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient has persistent tachycardia and hypotension, which can worsen cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has esophagitis, which can lead to bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
8. Nutritional Deficits: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition, which can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
9. Thrombotic Complications: The patient is at risk of developing thrombosis due to the presence of an indwelling port and the use of heparin.
10. Cancer Progression: The patient has metastatic breast cancer, which can worsen with time and lead to further complications.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her volume status, electrolyte imbalances, and hepatic and renal function. She should also receive ongoing treatment for her cancer, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Additionally, she should receive prophylactic measures to prevent infections, such as antibiotics and antiviral medication, and close monitoring for signs of bleeding, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension and now with BRPBR.
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 31.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -Cotinue fluconazole for candidal esophagitis for 14-21 days
   - continue Ganciclovir ([**11-13**]-present); course for immunocompromised pt
   [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks, which is appropriate in this case.
   #.  Hypotension: Improved, likely dehydration in setting of poor PO
   intake with dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit at admission.
   MAPS now high 70s.
   - prn albumin if becomes acutely hypotensive or tachycardia worsens
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   # Liver Failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Could also be
   caused by CMV.  Liver dysfunction is likely contributing to full body
   volume overload, leading to peripheral edema and ascites.
   -plan to restart home dose PO lasix and aldactone today
   - prn albumin as above
   -aggressive nutrition
   - hold lactulose for now
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Resolved. Likely from dilaudid use and
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension, infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -pt has not been receiving lactulose regularly; will only use if mental
   status worsens
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   .
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension and now with BRPBR.
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 31.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -Cotinue fluconazole for candidal esophagitis for 14-21 days
   - continue Ganciclovir ([**11-13**]-present); course for immunocompromised pt
   [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks, which is appropriate in this case.
   #.  Hypotension: Improved, likely dehydration in setting of poor PO
   intake with dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit at admission.
   MAPS now high 70s.
   - prn albumin if becomes acutely hypotensive or tachycardia worsens
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   # Liver Failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Could also be
   caused by CMV.  Liver dysfunction is likely contributing to full body
   volume overload, leading to peripheral edema and ascites.
   -plan to restart home dose PO lasix and aldactone today
   - prn albumin as above
   -aggressive nutrition
   - hold lactulose for now
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Resolved. Likely from dilaudid use and
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension, infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -pt has not been receiving lactulose regularly; will only use if mental
   status worsens
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   .
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion prn
   -continue telemetry monitoring
   .
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer, liver metastasis, and bone metastasis, presenting with dysphagia, hypotension, and bleeding (BRBPR).
* She is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids, with a history of liver failure, white plaques in the oropharynx suggestive of thrush, and positive for CMV.
* The patient has been treated with fluconazole for candidal esophagitis and Ganciclovir for immunocompromised patients.
* Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating liver dysfunction.
* She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a recent episode of BRBPR, and is currently receiving vitamin K and anticoagulation therapy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and her ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of further bleeding.
2. **Liver Failure:** The patient's liver function is compromised, which may lead to further deterioration in her condition, including encephalopathy, ascites, and portal hypertension.
3. **Infection/Sepsis:** The patient's immunocompromised state and history of chemotherapy make her susceptible to infections, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's elevated PTT and INR suggest a bleeding diathesis, which may be exacerbated by her ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
5. **Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's history of dehydration, diuretic use, and hyponatremia may lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, including hypovolemic hyponatremia.
6. **Pain Management:** The patient's ongoing pain management with opioids and other medications may lead to adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, constipation, and nausea.
7. **Cancer Progression:** The patient's breast cancer may progress, leading to further metastasis and potential complications.
8. **Infection of Central Venous Catheter:** The patient's central venous catheter may become infected, leading to sepsis and bacteremia.

**Plan:**

* Continue anticoagulation therapy with protamine if further bleeding episodes occur.
* Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust therapy accordingly.
* Continue immunosuppressive therapy with Ganciclovir.
* Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue pain management with opioids and other medications, monitoring for adverse effects.
* Consider restarting home dose of PO lasix and aldactone.
* Plan for aggressive nutrition and hold lactulose for now.
* Hold dilaudid for now, using 0.25mg doses as needed.
* Consider stopping lovenox due to elevated PTT.
* Monitor the patient's coagulation profile and adjust therapy accordingly.
* Plan for a family meeting with HCP today at 2 pm to discuss hospice care and future management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch, 74.5 kg (admission: 72.2 kg) immunocompromised individual with a history of breast cancer, currently receiving treatment in the ICU. The patient's 24-hour events are significant for the development of arterial line stop, BRBPR, and elevated PTT, which prompted the administration of vitamin K and the consideration of protamine treatment.

The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 99/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination is notable for scleral icterus, jaundice, and right and left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7-7.1 K/uL
* Hct: 41.9-31.2%
* Plt: 150-110 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90-107 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 17.0/106.6/1.5, ALT / AST: 145/192, Alk Phos / T Bili: 493/20.6, Differential-Neuts: 72.7%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 24.2%, Mono: 2.9%, Eos: 0.2%, Fibrinogen: 206 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.6 mmol/L, Albumin: 1.9 g/dL, LDH: 557 IU/L, Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.8 mg/dL, PO4: 1.7 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is significant for Gastrointestinal Bleed, Hepatic Failure, Fulminant, Renal Failure, Acute, and Hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Bleeding complications due to the gastrointestinal bleed and the patient's thrombocytopenia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy and increased risk of sepsis due to the patient's fulminant hepatic failure.
3. Acute kidney injury and potential need for renal replacement therapy due to the patient's acute renal failure.
4. Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
5. Development of sepsis and multi-organ failure due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of multiple comorbidities.
6. Potential for further bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and the presence of multiple invasive devices.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 32.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days given thrush on exam, now also on Ganciclovir since [**11-13**].
   course for Ganciclovir for immunocompromised pt [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks
   depending on if sxs are resolving
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit at admission.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - continue albumin dose at noon today, dose with spironolactone and
   lasix given peripheral edema
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some, continue
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -guiaic stools
   -active T&S
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca has normalized to 9.1

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the bone and liver, admitted with dysphagia and hypotension. She has been experiencing a drop in hemoglobin count, which has stabilized at 32% after administration of vitamin K and stopping enoxaparin. She has also been experiencing thrush in the oropharynx, which has been treated with fluconazole. Her PTT remains elevated.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to dehydration, poor PO intake, diuretic use, high BUN/Cr ratio, and hyponatremia. She is also immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids, making her prone to infection and sepsis.

Her altered mental status is likely due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. She has also been experiencing tachycardia, which may be secondary to intravascular depletion or pain.

The patient's liver failure is significant, with elevated LFTs and T Bili. She has been experiencing hypercalcemia, which has normalized to 9.1 after treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's PTT remains elevated, and she is at risk of bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulants.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and poor wound healing make her prone to infection and sepsis.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is significant, and she is at risk of further deterioration, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and death.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is a recurring problem, and she is at risk of further complications, such as kidney damage and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a concern, especially in the setting of liver failure, and can lead to seizures and brain damage.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and tachycardia make her at risk of respiratory failure, especially if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia make her at risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin count and PTT to prevent bleeding.
2. Continue to treat the patient's thrush and liver failure with antifungal and antiviral medications.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluid repletion and diuretics.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypercalcemia and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent respiratory and urinary tract infections.
8. Consider stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Consider palliative care and hospice services to manage the patient's symptoms and improve her quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer admitted with oro-pharyngeal
   candidiasis with course complicated by hypotension.  We had substantial
   concern for worsening respiratory status but today has increased
   comfort with limitation on further fluid being given.
   1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)-HCT has been without change
   -Follow stool output
   -Will provide vitamin K for support
   -Will need to consider FFP for any further bleeding
   2)HYPOTENSION-This has been considered multifactorial with relative
   compromise of effective filling pressures, substantial decrease in
   oncotic pressure and vasodilatory effects of dilaudid with prolonged
   impact in the setting of hepatic dysfunction and possible infection
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Dex 12mg/d
   -Emiric antibiotics will be D/C
d at 72 hours of culture negative
   -GCV--for positive CMV viral load
   -Will move to aldactone lasix
   3)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS-
   -Lactulose
   4)ORO-PHARYNGEAL PAIN-This is likely related to fungal infection with
   significant pain noted with good response to local treatment
   -Fluconazole to continue
   -Will continue with local Rx
   5)HEPATIC FAILURE--likely secondary to metastatic insult from breast
   cancer mets.
   -Lactulose
   -Lasix/Aldactone
   -Albumin as needed for hypotension was reasonable but not needed now
   -Will need to follow coagulopathy going forward
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will move to PO intake today as tolerated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU with oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, with potential complications arising from various factors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 121 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/70 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, with a value of 10.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 110 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of ALT and AST, and a decreased albumin level.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 99% on room air. The patient is not receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. The patient's extremities are edematous, with a 4+ edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and the patient is at risk of further bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is at risk of further hypotension.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's neurological status is altered, and the patient may be at risk of further deterioration.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient may be at risk of further liver damage.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient may be at risk of further bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of stool output and vitamin K support for gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Vasopressor support and consideration of FFP for hypotension.
3. Lactulose and lasix/aldactone for altered mental status and hepatic failure.
4. Fluconazole and local treatment for oro-pharyngeal pain.
5. Prophylaxis with boots and re-evaluation for anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.
7. Monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor once stabilized."
