   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.
   - Possible PPM today
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - FU TSH level
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   #. Hypertension - Patient hypertensive in the ED and upon reaching the
   CCU.  He reports that his blood pressures always run high after
   dialysis and he is on a number of medications for BP control.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, clonidine 0.2mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Patient due for his morning doses of his BP meds this morning, and
   will titrate up these medications as needed as patient still
   hypertensive
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Unlikely CAD as patient without history of chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Have started simvastatin 20mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed today and
   currently electrolytes are within normal limits.  Patient with prior
   graft sites on both left and right side; current dialysis site is
   through left IJ line and vascular surgery does not recommend further
   attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Peripheral Vascular Disease - patient with significant peripheral
   vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - Will order venous studies as recommended by vascular service here and
   will consult them with questions
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Encourage smoking cessation
   Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with wheezing
   at baseline.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as
   fexofenadine
   .
   #. Prostate cancer -  currently stable and status post-XRT.
   .
   #. Depression - continued citalopram, Aricept

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Prostate cancer: The patient has stable prostate cancer and is being treated with citalopram and Aricept.
* Depression: The patient has depression and is being treated with citalopram and Aricept.

The patient's plan of care is:

* Continue lisinopril, diovan, amlodipine, clonidine, and HCTZ for hypertension
* Continue ASA 81mg po daily for CAD
* Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily for CAD
* Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps for chronic kidney disease
* Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF
* Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0 and Mag>2.0
* Continue ASA 81mg po daily for peripheral vascular disease
* Encourage smoking cessation
* Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as fexofenadine for asthma/COPD
* Continue citalopram and Aricept for depression
* Continue cardiac/heart healthy diet
* Monitor for signs of DVT, VAP, and stress ulcer
* Consider PPM today for bradycardia
* FU EP recs

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and is currently hypertensive and bradycardic. He has a history of significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely due to 2nd-degree AV block, which may be secondary to calcifications, coronary artery disease, or hypothyroidism. He requires a pacemaker, and access may be difficult due to his peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft complications.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with multiple medications, but he may require titration of his medications as needed.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, which may be contributing to his bradycardia. He is currently on aspirin and simvastatin, but further management may be necessary.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis and has a history of graft complications. He requires continued dialysis and electrolyte monitoring.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease, which may affect access for his pacemaker procedure. He requires further evaluation and management.
6. Asthma/COPD: The patient has a history of asthma and COPD, which may be contributing to his wheezing. He requires continued management with his outpatient inhalers.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, which is currently stable.
8. Depression: The patient is taking citalopram and Aricept for depression, but further management may be necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Pacemaker procedure: The patient requires a pacemaker procedure to manage his bradycardia.
2. Continued dialysis: The patient requires continued dialysis and electrolyte monitoring.
3. Management of hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires continued management with his medications.
4. Further evaluation and management of CAD: The patient requires further evaluation and management of his CAD.
5. Evaluation and management of peripheral vascular disease: The patient requires further evaluation and management of his peripheral vascular disease.
6. Continued management of asthma/COPD: The patient requires continued management of his asthma/COPD.
7. Continued management of depression: The patient requires continued management of his depression.

Note: The patient's code status is full code, and he is likely to be discharged home after his pacemaker procedure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.
   - Possible PPM today
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - FU TSH level
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   #. Hypertension - Patient hypertensive in the ED and upon reaching the
   CCU.  He reports that his blood pressures always run high after
   dialysis and he is on a number of medications for BP control.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, clonidine 0.2mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Patient due for his morning doses of his BP meds this morning, and
   will titrate up these medications as needed as patient still
   hypertensive
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Unlikely CAD as patient without history of chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Have started simvastatin 20mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed today and
   currently electrolytes are within normal limits.  Patient with prior
   graft sites on both left and right side; current dialysis site is
   through left IJ line and vascular surgery does not recommend further
   attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Peripheral Vascular Disease - patient with significant peripheral
   vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - Will order venous studies as recommended by vascular service here and
   will consult them with questions
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Encourage smoking cessation
   # Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with
   wheezing at baseline.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as
   fexofenadine
   .
   #. Prostate cancer -  currently stable and status post-XRT.
   .
   #. Depression - continued citalopram, Aricept

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD, who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia. He is currently hypertensive and bradycardic, but asymptomatic. His physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing throughout lung fields, regular rhythm with bradycardia, and no m/r/g auscultated. His laboratory results show mildly depressed systolic function with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen and lead to cardiac arrest if not treated promptly. A pacemaker may be necessary to regulate his heart rhythm.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen and lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney damage.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD may worsen and lead to myocardial infarction, angina, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient's kidney function may worsen and lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or anemia.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen and lead to limb ischemia, gangrene, or amputation.
6. Asthma/COPD: The patient's asthma/COPD may worsen and lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, or cardiac arrest.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient's prostate cancer may progress and lead to metastasis, bone pain, or spinal cord compression.
8. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen and lead to suicidal ideation, anxiety, or worsening of other medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Pacemaker insertion to regulate the patient's heart rhythm.
2. Optimization of blood pressure control to prevent cardiovascular complications.
3. Continuation of medications for CAD, hypertension, and asthma/COPD.
4. Consultation with a renal fellow to optimize dialysis and electrolyte management.
5. Consultation with a vascular specialist to assess the patient's peripheral vascular disease and recommend further management.
6. Encouragement of smoking cessation to prevent worsening of peripheral vascular disease.
7. Monitoring of the patient's prostate cancer and depression, and adjustment of treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  Unable to place pacemaker. Will consider OR today or next
   week pending EP recommendations.
   - Possible PPM today or next week.
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Chest Pain: EKG without concerning changes. Nitro appeared to
   alleviate. Certainly unstable angina/NSTEMI are concerns in patient
   with known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular
   disease, and chronic kidney disease. Resolved after approx 30 minutes.
   - Repeat EKG this AM.
   - Monitor on Telemetry\

   this morning for dialysis.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - clonidine changed to 0.2mg po BID
   - Consider uptitrating meds to better control BP.
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Some chest pain this morning. Given risk factors
   this may represent CAD.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Simvastatin Increase to 40mg Daily, last LDL 118.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a 2nd-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with some conduction to the ventricles.

The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with one SL nitrogen treatment. The EKG did not show any concerning changes. However, the patient's history of coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease make unstable angina/NSTEMI a concern.

The patient's blood pressure continues to be elevated, and his medications have been adjusted accordingly. His cardiac function is mildly depressed, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.

The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease and has undergone vascular surgery. He has a history of asthma and COPD, and his respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and bronchodilators.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical plan includes continued dialysis, with a plan to increase the frequency of dialysis to three times a week. He will also receive anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and aspirin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Unstable angina/NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and chest pain, there is a risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's 2nd-degree AV block and bradycardia increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure can lead to cardiovascular complications.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease can lead to complications such as limb ischemia and gangrene.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's asthma and COPD increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's mild anemia and electrolyte imbalance can lead to complications such as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and bradycardia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 45 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 158/72 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and has a dialysis catheter in place.

The patient has a small hematoma in the subclavian area following an attempted access for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) procedure. The procedure was unsuccessful, and the patient is awaiting an epicardial pacemaker implantation in the operating room.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 188 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 5.2 mg/dL, and their potassium level is 28 mEq/L. 

The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to the lack of palpable pulses in the right and left radial and dorsal pedal areas. The patient's skin and neurologic examination is also incomplete. 

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding complications from the small hematoma in the subclavian area.
2. Infection due to the hematoma or the dialysis catheter.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying chronic respiratory disease.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's bradycardia and potential cardiac instability.
5. Renal failure exacerbation due to the patient's underlying ESRD and potential complications from the dialysis catheter.
6. Infection or sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of hypertension and potential stress ulceration.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the need for further interventions, close monitoring and frequent assessments are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Despite attempts to place a pacemaker, it was unsuccessful due to a small hematoma in the subclavian area. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 45 beats per minute and blood pressure of 158/72 mmHg. He has diffuse wheezing in the lung fields and is on oxygen therapy.

The patient has a history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, which increases the risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI. He has also been experiencing chest pain, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin.

The patient is currently on dialysis and has a history of graft sites on both left and right sides. The current dialysis site is through the left internal jugular (IJ) line. He is also taking medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable angina/NSTEMI: The patient's history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen if the pacemaker is not successfully placed.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's history of hypertension and CAD increases the risk of hemodynamic instability.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse wheezing in the lung fields may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of graft sites and dialysis catheter increases the risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's small hematoma in the subclavian area may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
7. Kidney disease progression: The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure.
2. Consider placing the pacemaker in the operating room or next week pending EP recommendations.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CAD with medications.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0 and Mag>2.0.
5. Continue to provide oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
6. Consider uptitrating medications to better control the patient's blood pressure.
7. Consult a renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while the patient is in the hospital."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Chest pain this AM. [**2170-5-17**] left anterior chest wall radiated to left
   scapula. No shortness of breath, no diaphoresis, no radiation down the
   arm. Improved with one SL nitrogen x2. Pain resolved within 30 minutes.
   EKG without significant change (small change in V2 from baseline but
   does not appear to represent ST elevation).
   - Vascular took off right unna boot today. Will use adaptic dressing
   with cover sponge and light ace wrap changed daily while in hospital.
   Will call vascular before d/c to place unna boot back on.
   - ABI's; did not do yesterday b/c of low HR and concern for taking off
   of floor.
   - PPM: unable to obtain any access, so could not do PPM. EP recommends
   performing an epicardial pacemaker in the OR
   - Small hematoma in subclavian s/p attempted access in PPM;

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 30's-40's, which is a concern. The patient's rhythm is 2nd degree AV block, which may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Chest Pain: The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease increase the risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are consistently elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. The patient's medications may need to be adjusted to better control blood pressure.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient's kidney function is severely impaired, and they require dialysis three times a week. The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored, and repletion therapy should be initiated if necessary.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease, which increases the risk of further complications, such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
6. Asthma/COPD: The patient has a history of asthma and COPD, which can exacerbate respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, which may require further management and monitoring.
8. Depression: The patient is taking antidepressant medications, which may need to be adjusted or monitored for efficacy and potential side effects.

In terms of the patient's current condition, the following are the most pressing concerns:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
2. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain needs to be closely monitored, and further evaluation and management should be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient's kidney function needs to be closely monitored, and repletion therapy should be initiated if necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.

In terms of the patient's plan of care, the following are the most important considerations:

1. Bradycardia: The patient may require further evaluation and management, including placement of a pacemaker.
2. Chest Pain: The patient may require further evaluation and management, including repeat EKG and stress test.
3. Hypertension: The patient's medications may need to be adjusted to better control blood pressure.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient will require dialysis three times a week, and their electrolyte levels will need to be closely monitored and repleted as necessary.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient will require further evaluation and management, including consideration for angioplasty or bypass surgery.
6. Asthma/COPD: The patient will require further evaluation and management, including consideration for inhalers and bronchodilators.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient will require further evaluation and management, including consideration for further treatment or monitoring.
8. Depression: The patient will require further evaluation and management, including consideration for adjustment of antidepressant medications or referral to a mental health professional."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to asymptomatic bradycardia, which was later diagnosed as a high-grade AV nodal block. He underwent a VDD implant via axillary access yesterday, which was successful, but was complicated by significant bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F), Heart rate 62 bpm, Blood pressure 150/50 mmHg, Respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 99%.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-appearing, with no signs of distress. He has diffuse wheezing throughout the lung fields, and his abdomen is slightly distended with large kidneys palpable bilaterally.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 13.3 K/μL, Hematocrit 33.5%, Platelet count 206 K/μL, Creatinine 5.6 mg/dL, Troponin-T 0.34 ng/mL, and Glucose 79 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

* Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is consistent with a high-grade AV nodal block, which was treated with a VDD implant. However, the patient's heart rate is still relatively low, and he may require further management to optimize his cardiac rhythm.
* Chest pain: The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which was treated with nitroglycerin and resolved after approximately 30 minutes. However, the patient's risk factors for unstable angina/NSTEMI are significant, and he may require further evaluation and management.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he may require further management to control his blood pressure.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and his recent chest pain may be related to this condition.
* Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient is on dialysis three times a week, and his electrolyte levels will need to be closely monitored to ensure that they remain within normal ranges.
* Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease, and his recent pacemaker implant may have further compromised his circulation.
* Asthma/COPD: The patient has long-standing asthma and COPD, and his wheezing may require further management with bronchodilators and other medications.

Based on this information, the patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and recent chest pain may indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin levels may indicate a higher risk of myocardial infarction.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent electrolyte abnormalities may indicate a higher risk of renal failure.
* Peripheral ischemia: The patient's peripheral vascular disease and recent pacemaker implant may indicate a higher risk of peripheral ischemia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's asthma and COPD may indicate a higher risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his wheezing is not well-controlled.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications. His bradycardia and chest pain may indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction, while his chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease may indicate a higher risk of renal failure and peripheral ischemia. His asthma and COPD may indicate a higher risk of respiratory failure."

   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He underwent pacemaker placement yesterday with some
   bleeding but no other complications.
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Chest Pain: EKG without concerning changes. Nitro appeared to
   alleviate. Certainly unstable angina/NSTEMI are concerns in patient
   with known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular
   disease, and chronic kidney disease. Resolved after approx 30 minutes.

   this morning for dialysis.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Clonidine changed to 0.2mg po BID
   - Consider uptitrating meds to better control BP.
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Some chest pain this morning. Given risk factors
   this may represent CAD.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Simvastatin Increase to 40mg Daily, last LDL 118.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Trend CE
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD
 Patient dialyzed yesterday,
   will be dialyzed again Monday.  Patient with prior graft sites on both
   left and right side; current dialysis site is through left IJ line and
   vascular surgery does not recommend further attempts at grafts in the
   upper extremities.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement yesterday. He has been experiencing chest pain and has a history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. He has also been diagnosed with asthma/COPD and has a history of depression and prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia/Rhythm: The patient's bradycardia is likely related to his pacemaker placement, but it is essential to monitor his rhythm closely to ensure that it does not worsen.
2. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain may be related to his CAD, and it is crucial to monitor his EKG and troponin levels to rule out unstable angina/NSTEMI.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and it is essential to continue his antihypertensive medications and consider uptitrating them to better control his blood pressure.
4. CAD: The patient's CAD is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue his aspirin and statin therapy to reduce his risk of cardiac events.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue his dialysis and monitor his electrolytes closely to ensure that they remain within normal ranges.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue his antithrombotic therapy and consider referring him to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and management.
7. Asthma/COPD: The patient's asthma/COPD is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue his bronchodilator therapy and consider referring him to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.
8. Depression: The patient's depression is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue his antidepressant therapy and consider referring him to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's rhythm and EKG closely to ensure that his bradycardia does not worsen.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's chest pain and troponin levels to rule out unstable angina/NSTEMI.
3. Continue the patient's antihypertensive medications and consider uptitrating them to better control his blood pressure.
4. Continue the patient's aspirin and statin therapy to reduce his risk of cardiac events.
5. Continue the patient's dialysis and monitor his electrolytes closely to ensure that they remain within normal ranges.
6. Continue the patient's antithrombotic therapy and consider referring him to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and management.
7. Continue the patient's bronchodilator therapy and consider referring him to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.
8. Continue the patient's antidepressant therapy and consider referring him to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including bradycardia/rhythm, chest pain, hypertension, CAD, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, asthma/COPD, and depression. It is essential to continue to monitor his condition closely and make adjustments to his therapy as needed to ensure that he receives the best possible care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD, presented with asymptomatic bradycardia. He underwent pacemaker placement yesterday with some bleeding but no other complications. The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin. His blood pressures continue to be elevated, and his medications were held this morning for dialysis. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, making it a concern for unstable angina/NSTEMI. He is also experiencing wheezing and has a history of asthma and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, there is a high risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated, which may lead to further complications if not controlled.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's wheezing and history of asthma and COPD may lead to respiratory complications such as bronchospasm or respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's pacemaker placement and history of coronary artery disease may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and dialysis dependence may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances or acute kidney injury.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and lines may increase the risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressures and adjust medications as necessary to control hypertension.
2. Repeat EKG and trend CE to assess for any changes in cardiac rhythm or function.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust medications as necessary to manage wheezing and bronchospasm.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary to manage arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal status and adjust medications as necessary to manage electrolyte imbalances or acute kidney injury.
6. Consider uptitrating medications to better control blood pressure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and take measures to prevent infection.
8. Consider referral to a cardiologist or nephrologist for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD), was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for asymptomatic bradycardia. He underwent successful pacemaker placement via axillary access, with some bleeding and a decrease in hematocrit. He experienced episodes of chest pain, which were alleviated with nitroglycerin. He also has a history of chronic kidney disease stage V, peripheral vascular disease, and asthma/COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, there is a concern for unstable angina/NSTEMI, which may have been triggered by the pacemaker placement.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient's bleeding during the pacemaker procedure and decreased hematocrit may indicate a risk for further bleeding complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated, which may require further management and consideration for uptitration of antihypertensive medications.
4. CAD: The patient's history of CAD, combined with new onset bradycardia and chest pain, may indicate a risk for CAD progression or complications.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease stage V and need for hemodialysis may require close monitoring of electrolytes and consideration for adjustments to dialysis therapy.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease may increase the risk for complications, such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
7. Asthma/COPD: The patient's wheezing and history of asthma/COPD may require close monitoring and consideration for adjustments to bronchodilator therapy.
8. Depression: The patient's history of depression may require ongoing management and consideration for adjustments to antidepressant therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results.
2. Adjust antihypertensive medications as needed to control blood pressure.
3. Consider uptitration of simvastatin to 40mg daily to manage LDL levels.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider adjustments to dialysis therapy as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's asthma/COPD with bronchodilators and consider adjustments to therapy as needed.
6. Consider a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out CAD.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease and consider further evaluation and management as needed.
8. Consider a psychiatric evaluation to assess the patient's depression and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia. He underwent pacemaker placement yesterday with some bleeding but no other complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.7°C, Tcurrent 35.9°C, HR 62 bpm, BP 150/50 mmHg, RR 11 breaths/min, SpO2 99%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula O2 delivery device, SpO2 99%.
* Physical examination: Well-appearing male with no significant abnormalities, except for mild wheezing throughout lung fields, and moderately tender to palpation at the site of pacemaker insertion on the right shoulder.
* Lab results:
	+ WBC: 6.9-13.3 K/μL
	+ Hct: 31.1-33.5%
	+ Plt: 170-206 K/μL
	+ Cr: 5.2-7.5 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 0.27-0.34 ng/mL
	+ Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 5.0 mg/dL
* Medical conditions:
	+ Bradycardia/rhythm: Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to the ventricles.
	+ Chest pain: EKG without concerning changes, nitro appeared to alleviate.
	+ Anemia: Patient with decreased hematocrit after his procedure yesterday where bleeding was noted.
	+ Hypertension: Blood pressures continue to be elevated.
	+ CAD: Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new onset bradycardia.

	+ Peripheral vascular disease: Patient with significant peripheral vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
	+ Asthma/COPD: Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with wheezing at baseline.
	+ Prostate cancer: Currently stable and status post-XRT.
	+ Depression: Continued citalopram, Aricept.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Unstable angina/NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, this is a concern.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's bradycardia and history of CAD, this is a concern.
* Hypertensive crisis: Given the patient's history of hypertension and elevated blood pressures, this is a concern.
* Renal failure: Given the patient's chronic kidney disease stage V on HD, this is a concern.
* Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of COPD and wheezing, this is a concern.
* Infection: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and dialysis, this is a concern.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and anemia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adjusting the pacemaker settings as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider adjusting the oxygen therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0 and Mag>2.0.
* Continue to monitor the patient's dialysis catheter and consider changing the dialysis site if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease and consider adjusting the anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's depression and consider adjusting the antidepressant therapy as necessary."
