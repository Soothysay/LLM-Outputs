   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of mod-severe
   AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN, osteoporosis s/p repair
   of periprosthetic fracture of the right femur.
   .
   Plan:
   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - ABX for 24 hr - Ancef
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
   - pain control
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt intubated, but neurologically active.  Pt has
   been given >8L fluids intra-op and post-op.  Pt with history of severe
   AS and given volume status may be difficulty weaning from vent.
   However, CXR this AM did not show increasing pulmonary edema. RSBI was
   <100 today.  Pt was placed on 5/0 and tolerating.
   - will attempt to wean and extubate this AM
   - will have BiPap ready  at bedside
   - pull ET tube back 3-4 cm if not extubated today.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued intermittent hypotension throughout
   the night and evening.  Given hx of AS ventilation could be
   contributing to decreased pre-load and hypotension.  Additionally, pt
   could be volume depleted post-op and sedation could contribute to
   hypotension.
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - will have dobutamine and neo ready at bedside if pt becomes pressor
   dependent
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110 without need for pressors. Will likely cont. to
   require volume. Long term plan for elective AV replacement.
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Per cards, if pressors needed would use phenylephrine
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be secondary to
   AS/cardiac
   - cont. Flovent, prn albuterol
   .
   # Osteoporosis
   - VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate
   .
   # Anemia: Approx 2L EBL, 6 u pRBCs given in OR. Lasix with blood
   transfusions as needed peri-operatively per cards
   - Monitor CRIT
   .
   # GERD
   - Continue PPI
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet, monitor volume status closely given AS, replete
   lytes prn
   .
   # PPX: Lovenox post-op, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: R subclavian will be pulled due to line being in vertebral
   vein., A-line, PIV x 2
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and a recent periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She underwent surgical repair of the fracture and is currently in the ICU for post-operative care. The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which was treated with a 500cc NS bolus and 0.4mg narcan. She was also found to have a central venous line (CVL) in the vertebral vein, which was removed. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation, and her respiratory status is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of severe AS and pulmonary hypertension may make it difficult to wean her from the ventilator. She is at risk for developing respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension overnight may be related to her AS, volume depletion, or sedation. She is at risk for continued hypotension, which could lead to decreased cardiac output and organ dysfunction.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and history of AS. She is receiving Lovenox for prophylaxis, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of DVT.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of AS and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk for developing pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and cardiac function is necessary to detect any signs of pulmonary edema.
5. Infection: The patient's surgical site and CVL removal increase her risk for infection. Close monitoring of her wound and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
6. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of AS and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm is necessary to detect any signs of arrhythmias.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis increases her risk for fractures and decreased bone density. Close monitoring of her bone health and fracture risk is necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's history of anemia increases her risk for further anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and transfusion needs is necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and a recent periprosthetic fracture of the right femur that was surgically repaired.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She has been given a lot of fluids and has a history of difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The plan is to attempt to wean and extubate the patient this morning.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 104 bpm (103-135 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/45 mmHg (59-207/115 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (12-17 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure: 8 mmHg (8-16 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* TCO2: 26
* ABG: 7.38/43/147//0
* PaO2/FiO2: 294

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, her peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, and her skin, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations are also not assessed.

The patient's plan includes:

* Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
* Antibiotics for 24 hours (Ancef)
* Hip abduction pillow and brace
* Pain control
* Repeat hip and femur X-ray
* Monitoring of urine output

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the primary reason for her admission to the ICU. She has been given a lot of fluids, which may make it difficult for her to wean from the ventilator.
* Sepsis: The patient's history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis and her recent surgical procedure make her at risk for sepsis.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis and her recent surgical procedure make her at risk for deep vein thrombosis.
* Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and her recent surgical procedure make her at risk for pneumonia.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis and her recent surgical procedure make her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Osteoporosis-related fractures: The patient's history of osteoporosis and her recent surgical procedure make her at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her plan of care as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe and effective treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of mod-severe
   AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN, osteoporosis s/p repair
   of periprosthetic fracture of the right femur.
   .
   Plan:
   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
   - pain control (Morphine prn - 7mg total in 24hrs)
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop -->goal >30cc/hr,  bolus prn
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt sucessfully extubated. LOS fluid blance is
   +7L.  Pt currenlty on 4L NC.  Pt with history of severe AS and given
   volume status respiratory stauts my be complicated by pulmonary edema.
   However, pt appears comfortable and satting well.
   - will attempt to wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider lasix prn if SOB or new O2 requirement
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued hypotension and slightly increased neo
   requirement overnight to 0.7.  Additionally, pt is prelaod dependent
   given AS. Pt could still be volume depeted post-op.  Still has low
   urine output. Pt no obvious signs of infection, had been afebrile and
   cultures NGTD.  Pt with leukocytosis post-op --> trending down
   (however, could be dilutional) and reactive due to surgery. No evidence
   of MI on EKG and CE negative.  Pt with limited pain medications, but
   could aslo be contributing to hypotension.
   - attempt to wean neo
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - t/c adding dobutamine if becomes more hypotensive.
   - f/u cards recs
   - hold on any antibiotics for now
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110.  Currently, however is on neo.  Long term plan
   for elective AV replacement.
   - plan as above for hypotension
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # Anemia: Approx 2L EBL, 6 u pRBCs given in OR. Hct today is 23.1.
   Will plan to transfuse today.
   - transfuse 1U pRBC with lasix
   - transfusion goal Hct >25
   - Monitor CRIT
   .
   # COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be secondary to
   AS/cardiac
   - cont. Flovent, prn albuterol
   .
   # Osteoporosis
   - VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate
   .
   # GERD
   - Continue PPI
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet, monitor volume status closely given AS, replete
   lytes prn
   .
   # PPX: Lovenox post-op, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: RIJ placed yesterday., A-line, PIV x 2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy at 4 liters per nasal cannula and is extubated.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which has been managed with phenylephrine and has required a slight increase in her norepinephrine (neo) requirement overnight. She has also been experiencing a distributive pattern of hypotension, which may be related to her underlying AS.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a history of mild COPD and is at risk for pulmonary edema due to her volume status and AS.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL. She has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in the operating room and will require further transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level above 25.

The patient's medical plan includes continued monitoring of her urine output, which is currently at 30 mL per hour, and bolus therapy as needed. She will also be weaned off of norepinephrine and will receive dobutamine if her blood pressure becomes too low. The patient's antibiotics will be held until further cultures are obtained.

The patient's code status is full code, and she has a RIJ placed yesterday. Her lines include an arterial line, two peripheral intravenous lines, and a multi-lumen line. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMW) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of mod-severe
   AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN, osteoporosis s/p repair
   of periprosthetic fracture of the right femur.
   .
   Plan:
   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
   - pain control (Morphine prn - 7mg total in 24hrs)
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop -->goal >30cc/hr,  bolus prn
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt sucessfully extubated. LOS fluid blance is
   +7L.  Pt currenlty on 4L NC.  Pt with history of severe AS and given
   volume status respiratory stauts my be complicated by pulmonary edema.
   However, pt appears comfortable and satting well.
   - will attempt to wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider lasix prn if SOB or new O2 requirement
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued hypotension and slightly increased neo
   requirement overnight to 0.7.  Additionally, pt is prelaod dependent
   given AS. Pt could still be volume depeted post-op.  Still has low
   urine output. Pt no obvious signs of infection, had been afebrile and
   cultures NGTD.  Pt with leukocytosis post-op --> trending down
   (however, could be dilutional) and reactive due to surgery. No evidence
   of MI on EKG and CE negative.  Pt with limited pain medications, but
   could aslo be contributing to hypotension.
   - attempt to wean neo
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - t/c adding dobutamine if becomes more hypotensive.
   - f/u cards recs
   - hold on any antibiotics for now
 f/u blood cx & urine cx
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110.  Currently, however is on neo.  Long term plan
   for elective AV replacement.
   - plan as above for hypotension
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # Anemia: Approx 2L EBL, 6 u pRBCs given in OR. Hct today is 23.1.
   Will plan to transfuse today.
   - transfuse 1U pRBC with lasix
   - transfusion goal Hct >25
   - Monitor CRIT
   .
   # COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be secondary to
   AS/cardiac
   - cont. Flovent, prn albuterol
   .
   # Osteoporosis
   - VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate
   .
   # GERD
   - Continue PPI
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet, monitor volume status closely given AS, replete
   lytes prn
   .
   # PPX: Lovenox post-op, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: RIJ placed yesterday., A-line, PIV x 2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She has a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and osteoporosis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for post-operative care.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. She is receiving phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place. She is receiving infusions of enoxaparin (Lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and morphine sulfate for pain control.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 149 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 102 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a respiratory support index (RSI) of 28.

The patient's neurological status is also stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 and a reactive pupils.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is receiving phenylephrine to maintain it. Further monitoring and management of her blood pressure are necessary to prevent complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and is at risk for pulmonary edema. Monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygen therapy are necessary to prevent complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobilization and history of aortic stenosis. Prophylaxis with enoxaparin (Lovenox) is necessary to prevent DVT.
4. Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place, which increases her risk of infection. Monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be due to blood loss during surgery. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary to correct her anemia.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which increases her risk of fractures. Monitoring of her bone density and treatment with bisphosphonate may be necessary to prevent further bone loss."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of mod-severe
   AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN, osteoporosis s/p repair
   of periprosthetic fracture of the right femur.
   .
   Plan:
   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
 PT to fit brace today
   - pain control (Morphine prn - 7mg total in 24hrs)
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop -->goal >30cc/hr,  bolus prn
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt sucessfully extubated. LOS fluid blance is
   +7L.  Pt currenlty on 4L NC.  Pt with history of severe AS and given
   volume status respiratory stauts my be complicated by pulmonary edema.
   However, pt appears comfortable and satting well.
   - will attempt to wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider lasix prn if SOB for new O2 requirement
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued hypotension and slightly increased neo
   requirement overnight to 0.7.  Additionally, pt is prelaod dependent
   given AS. Pt could still be volume depeted post-op.  Still has low
   urine output. Pt no obvious signs of infection, had been afebrile and
   cultures NGTD.  Pt with leukocytosis post-op --> trending down
   (however, could be dilutional) and reactive due to surgery. No evidence
   of MI on EKG and CE negative.  Pt with limited pain medications, but
   could aslo be contributing to hypotension.
   - attempt to wean neo
   - will give 1U pRBC
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - t/c adding dobutamine if becomes more hypotensive.
   - f/u cards recs
   - hold on any antibiotics for now
 f/u blood cx & urine cx
   - hold BB and other hypertensive meds given hypotension
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110.  Currently, however is on neo.  Long term plan
   for elective AV replacement.
   - plan as above for hypotension
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # Anemia: Approx 2L EBL, 6 u pRBCs given in OR. Hct today is 23.1.
   Will plan to transfuse today.
   - transfuse 1U pRBC with possible lasix
   - transfusion goal Hct >25
   - Monitor CRIT
   .
   # COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be secondary to
   AS/cardiac
   - cont. Flovent, prn albuterol
   .
   # Osteoporosis
   - VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate
   .
   # GERD
   - Continue PPI
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet, monitor volume status closely given AS, replete
   lytes prn
   .
   # PPX: Lovenox post-op, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: RIJ placed yesterday., A-line, PIV x 2
   .
   # Code: full code per medical record, will confirm with family in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
 PT to fit brace today
   - pain control (Morphine prn - 7mg total in 24hrs)
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop -->goal >30cc/hr,  bolus prn
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt sucessfully extubated. LOS fluid blance is
   +7L.  Pt currenlty on 4L NC.  Pt with history of severe AS and given
   volume status respiratory stauts my be complicated by pulmonary edema.
   However, pt appears comfortable and satting well.
   - will attempt to wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider lasix prn if SOB for new O2 requirement
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued hypotension and slightly increased neo
   requirement overnight to 0.7.  Additionally, pt is prelaod dependent
   given AS. Pt could still be volume depeted post-op.  Still has low
   urine output. Pt no obvious signs of infection, had been afebrile and
   cultures NGTD.  Pt with leukocytosis post-op --> trending down
   (however, could be dilutional) and reactive due to surgery. No evidence
   of MI on EKG and CE negative.  Pt with limited pain medications, but
   could aslo be contributing to hypotension.
   - attempt to wean neo
   - will give 1U pRBC
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - t/c adding dobutamine if becomes more hypotensive.
   - f/u cards recs
   - hold on any antibiotics for now
 f/u blood cx & urine cx
   - hold BB and other hypertensive meds given hypotension
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110.  Currently, however is on neo.  Long term plan
   for elective AV replacement.
   - plan as above for hypotension
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # Anemia: Approx 2L EBL, 6 u pRBCs given in OR. Hct today is 23.1.
   Will plan to transfuse today.
   - transfuse 1U pRBC with possible lasix
   - transfusion goal Hct >25
   - Monitor CRIT

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She underwent surgical repair of the fracture today.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off the ventilator. She is on oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula and has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure is 120/49 mmHg, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg. Her urine output is greater than 30 cc/hour, and she is receiving 250 cc bolus of fluid every hour.

The patient has a history of hypotension and has required phenylephrine to maintain her blood pressure. Her blood cultures, urinalysis, and culture are pending. She is also receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and mild elevation of creatinine. Her troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and her CK/CKMB levels are 890/8 ng/mL.

The patient's plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, weaning of oxygen therapy, and monitoring of her urine output and fluid balance. She will also receive pain management with morphine and will have her hip and femur X-ray repeated in the future.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema: Given her history of severe AS and volume status, she may be at risk for pulmonary edema, especially if her fluid balance is not closely monitored.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As she is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, it is essential to monitor her for signs of DVT and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Infection: As she has a history of hypotension and is receiving antibiotics, she is at risk for infection. Close monitoring of her temperature, white blood cell count, and cultures is essential.
4. Respiratory failure: Given her history of COPD and AS, she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygen therapy is not closely monitored.
5. Cardiac complications: As she has a history of moderate-severe AS, she may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
6. Osteoporosis: As she has a history of osteoporosis, she may be at risk for fractures, especially in the hip and femur.
7. Anemia: Given her history of anemia, she may be at risk for complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: As she is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, she may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure her safe recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent surgical repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She has a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She was successfully extubated and is currently receiving oxygen therapy at 2L. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 129/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her urine output has increased with improved oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of severe aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension may complicate her respiratory status, potentially leading to pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low urine output and SBP of 110-120 mmHg may indicate hypotension, which may be related to pain medication, infection, or cardiac factors.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is 24.3%, and she received 1U pRBC transfusion yesterday. She is planned to receive another 1U pRBC transfusion today.
4. COPD: The patient's mild COPD may exacerbate her respiratory status, particularly with her history of aortic stenosis and pulmonary hypertension.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may increase her risk of fractures, particularly with her recent periprosthetic fracture.
6. GERD: The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may require ongoing management to prevent complications.
7. Cardiac Status: The patient's moderate-severe aortic stenosis may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications.

Plan:

1. Continue oxygen therapy at 2L and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
2. Monitor urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue pain management with morphine and monitor for signs of hypotension.
4. Plan to transfuse 1U pRBC today and monitor for signs of anemia.
5. Continue COPD management with Flovent and prn albuterol.
6. Monitor for signs of osteoporosis-related fractures.
7. Continue GERD management with PPI.
8. Monitor cardiac status and adjust management as necessary.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition through a central line.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood sugar is well-controlled.
3. Lines: The patient has an arterial line, two peripheral IV lines, and a multi-lumen central line.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Comments: The patient's code status is full code, and she is to be transferred to the floor once hemodynamically stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent surgical repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur and was extubated yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 104 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 129/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95% on 2L nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.3%
* Platelet count: 149 x 10^9/L
* White blood cell count: 19.3 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated, but her lung function may be compromised due to her history of severe AS and pulmonary hypertension. She may require further respiratory support, and her oxygen requirement may need to be adjusted.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and her urine output is still decreased. She may require further fluid boluses and monitoring to ensure adequate blood pressure and urine output.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she has received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) so far. She will require further transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of >25%.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has moderate-severe AS, which may require further management, including cardiology consultation and potential elective aortic valve replacement.
5. COPD: The patient has mild COPD, which may be exacerbated by her respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, which may increase her risk of further fractures and complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of severe AS and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of developing pulmonary edema, which could worsen her respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of AS and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's surgical site and central lines may increase her risk of developing infections, which could worsen her condition.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding complications, which could worsen her condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further complications, including respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust her respiratory support as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Administer further fluid boluses and monitor her urine output to ensure adequate hydration and blood pressure.
4. Transfuse additional pRBCs as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level of >25%.
5. Consult with cardiology to further manage the patient's AS and potential complications.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as echocardiography, to assess the patient's cardiac function and potential complications.
7. Monitor the patient's oxygen requirement and adjust it as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's central lines and surgical site for signs of infection.
9. Consider further management of the patient's osteoporosis, including vitamin D and calcium supplements, and bisphosphonate therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent orthopedic left hip fixation and was admitted to the ICU for post-operative observation due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and subsequent hypotension. She has since been weaned off pressors and is hemodynamically stable. Her pain is well-controlled, and she is without complaint.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/55 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.3, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 149. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly low potassium level. Her troponin-T level is <0.01, indicating no cardiac damage.

The patient's plan includes holding her blood pressure medications until her blood pressure reaches baseline, discontinuing her arterial line today, and returning to the orthopedic service for further care. She is also being closely monitored for cardiovascular stability due to her aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular instability due to aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur if her blood pressure medications are not carefully managed.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and aortic stenosis.
4. Infection: The patient's surgical site may be at risk for infection, particularly if her wound is not properly cleaned and dressed.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's immobility may lead to thrombosis, particularly in the deep veins of her legs.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory compromise.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's clear diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not carefully monitored.
8. Medication interactions: The patient's multiple medications may interact with each other, leading to adverse effects."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old female who underwent orthopedic left hip fixation surgery and was admitted to the ICU for post-operative observation due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and subsequent hypotension. The patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight and is currently on morphine sulfate for pain control.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 125/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient's medical history is significant for aortic stenosis, which is likely contributing to her hypotension. She is currently on pressors, which have been weaned and held for 24 hours. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's history of aortic stenosis and hypotension during the post-operative period make her susceptible to further hypotensive episodes.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's aortic stenosis may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Wound complications: The patient's surgical site may be at risk for infection, dehiscence, or other complications.
5. DVT: The patient is receiving lovenox for prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. Medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications, which may interact with each other or with her underlying medical conditions, leading to adverse effects.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of complications and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."
