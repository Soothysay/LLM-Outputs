   EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **]
   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD last night bc of dyspnea. This is
   in combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - pulling off nipride, on labetolol gtt.
   -cont clonidine patch
   -urgent PD dialysis should improved BP as well.
   -cycle cardiac enzymes
   -repeat EKG in am
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD to remove 500 to 1L
   -f/u BNP
   -repeat TEE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept in am
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol in am
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   -BCx if spikes
   -f/u sputum Cx
   -f/u peritoneal cultures
   -f/u UA/Ucx
   -f/u urine legionella
   -start Vanc/Levo/Cefepime
   -Vanc level at 8pm [**8-29**]
   -consider coverage for PCP if not clinically improved
   -repeat CXR after diuresis with PD
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   -active T+S
   -xfuse 1 unit PRBC
   -[**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   -consider GI consult in am
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control
   -dilaudid to pain control
   # elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.
   -f/u LFTs, albumin
   -trend INR
   # FEN: noIVFs / replete lytes prn with PD / NPO
   # PPX: IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], heparin SQ, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **]
   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD last night bc of dyspnea. This is
   in combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - pulling off nipride, on labetolol gtt.
   -cont clonidine patch
   -urgent PD dialysis should improved BP as well.
   -cycle cardiac enzymes
   -repeat EKG in am
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD to remove 500 to 1L
   -f/u BNP
   -repeat TEE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept in am
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol in am
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.

   -consider coverage for PCP if not clinically improved
   -repeat CXR after diuresis with PD
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 56-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and headache. She was diagnosed with a hypertensive emergency and was treated with labetalol and nitroprusside. She is currently in the ICU and is being treated for pulmonary edema, heart failure, and asthma. The patient is also experiencing dyspnea, leukocytosis, and anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cyanide toxicity:** The patient is receiving nitroprusside, which can cause cyanide toxicity if not monitored closely. The physician plans to wean the patient off nitroprusside as soon as possible to minimize this risk.
2. **Pulmonary edema:** The patient's pulmonary edema is likely due to heart failure and volume overload. The physician is planning to use diuretics and continue PD dialysis to manage this condition.
3. **Asthma exacerbation:** The patient's recent diagnosis of asthma may have contributed to her presentation. The physician is planning to continue treatment with albuterol nebs and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
4. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis may be due to a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, or underlying disease. The physician is planning to perform further testing, including blood cultures and sputum cultures, to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be due to chronic kidney disease or other underlying conditions. The physician is planning to continue treatment with Procrit and monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels closely.
6. **Elevated INR:** The patient's elevated INR may be due to nutritional factors or other underlying conditions. The physician is planning to monitor the patient's LFTs and INR levels closely to ensure that they do not become further elevated.
7. **Infection:** The patient's low-grade fever and leukocytosis may indicate the presence of an infection. The physician is planning to perform further testing, including blood cultures and sputum cultures, to determine the cause of the infection.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue PD dialysis to manage the patient's pulmonary edema and heart failure.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Perform further testing, including blood cultures and sputum cultures, to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
4. Continue treatment with Procrit to manage the patient's anemia.
5. Monitor the patient's LFTs and INR levels closely to ensure that they do not become further elevated.
6. Consider coverage for PCP if the patient's leukocytosis does not improve with treatment.
7. Repeat CXR after diuresis with PD to monitor the patient's pulmonary edema."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **]
   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - renal recs
   - d/c nipride gtt as possible and d/c labetalol gtt as possible
   - continue labetalol po and attempt introducing po meds as possible
   - continue clonidine patch
   - PD
   - f/u EKG
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD today
   -f/u TTE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - CXR in AM
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - PPI daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,
   now resolved
   -dilaudid to pain control
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.
   -trend INR

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) with low-dose immunosuppression, diagnosed with asthma and presenting to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, and headache. She was found to have a hypertensive emergency, manifesting as pulmonary edema.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 99.8°F (37.7°C), heart rate 64 bpm, blood pressure 160/92 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 94%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 10.4 K/uL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, platelet count 84 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28 mg/dL, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, troponin-T 0.20 ng/mL, glucose 206 mg/dL, and lactic acid 1.1 mmol/L.
* Urinalysis: The patient has microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and pyuria, with a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI).
* Imaging studies: Chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema, and echocardiogram (TTE) is pending.
* Medications: The patient is receiving labetalol, nitroprusside, hydromorphone, and lorazepam, as well as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and antihypertensives.
* Plan: The patient is to continue on labetalol, nitroprusside, and antibiotics, and to undergo further testing, including a TTE and urine culture. She is also to receive dialysis and to have her immunosuppressive medications adjusted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and the use of medications such as labetalol and nitroprusside increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's UTI and pyuria increase the risk of sepsis and other infections.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia and history of chronic kidney disease increase the risk of anemia and bleeding.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and use of medications such as labetalol and nitroprusside increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and use of medications such as labetalol and nitroprusside increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and use of medications such as labetalol and nitroprusside increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Central nervous system complications: The patient's history of hypertension and the use of medications such as labetalol and nitroprusside increase the risk of central nervous system complications such as stroke and seizures.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [**Last Name (un)**] who was admitted to the ICU with renal failure, end-stage, and is being treated for hypertension, malignant. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper, and have been prescribed multiple medications, including labetalol, hydralazine, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 164/85 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They are receiving IV fluids and have been started on a proton pump inhibitor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. This could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, despite treatment with labetalol and hydralazine. This could lead to further complications, such as cardiac damage, cerebral hemorrhage, and retinopathy.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could recur or worsen, leading to further complications, such as hemorrhagic shock and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics, but their white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating the possibility of infection. This could lead to further complications, such as sepsis and organ failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with an ejection fraction of less than 55%. This could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for respiratory failure due to their underlying conditions.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which could lead to further complications, such as malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan:
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - renal recs
   - d/c nipride gtt as possible and d/c labetalol gtt as possible
   - continue labetalol po and attempt introducing po meds as possible
   - continue clonidine patch
   - PD
   - f/u EKG
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD today
   -f/u TTE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - CXR in AM
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - PPI daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,
   now resolved
   -dilaudid to pain control
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.
   -trend INR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan:
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - renal recs
   - d/c nipride gtt as possible and d/c labetalol gtt as possible
   - continue labetalol po and attempt introducing po meds as possible
   - continue clonidine patch
   - PD
   - f/u EKG
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD today
   -f/u TTE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - CXR in AM
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - PPI daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,
   now resolved
   -dilaudid to pain control
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) with low-dose immunosuppression, who presented to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), nausea (N/V), and headache (HA). She was diagnosed with hypertensive emergency and pulmonary edema. The patient was treated with labetalol and nitroprusside, and her condition improved.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.9°C (98.5°F), HR = 65 bpm, BP = 164/85 mmHg, RR = 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2 = 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: LVEF > 55%, mild LVH, no major changes from echo in [**2121**]
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device: None, SpO2: 97%
* Physical examination: General appearance: Thin, anxious; eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL, no pupils dilated, no conjunctiva pale; cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal, S3 present; respiratory/chest: symmetric expansion, dullness at bases bilaterally, crackles at 2/3 up from bases bilaterally
* Labs: WBC = 10.8, Hct = 21.8, Plt = 104,000, Cr = 16.0, TropT = 0.20, Glucose = 206

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and there is a risk of further hypertensive emergency if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further decompensation.
4. Uremic symptoms: The patient's uremic symptoms, such as N/V, may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may increase the risk of bleeding if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be considered:

1. Continue labetalol and nitroprusside to manage blood pressure and pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic parameters closely to ensure that her condition is stable.
3. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, to assess the patient's cardiac function and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.
4. Manage the patient's uremic symptoms, such as N/V, with appropriate medications and fluids.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications and fluids as necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Consider the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central venous catheters, and take appropriate precautions to prevent infection.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion if necessary.
8. Trend the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) with low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache, which were later diagnosed as a hypertensive emergency. She was treated with labetalol in the emergency department, which decreased her heart rate to the low 60s. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's medical history includes asthma, which was recently diagnosed, and she has been missing her PD and oral antihypertensive medications due to dyspnea. She has also been experiencing worsening pulmonary edema and heart failure with volume overload, as seen on the chest X-ray.

The patient's current medications include labetalol, clonidine patch, lasix, and albuterol nebs. She has been started on PD and is receiving labetalol IV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and she is at risk for further hypertensive complications.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of pulmonary edema, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure with volume overload may worsen if not managed with diuretics and other medications.
4. Asthma: The patient's recent diagnosis of asthma may worsen if not managed with bronchodilators and other medications.
5. Uremic syndrome: The patient's PD may not be functioning adequately, leading to uremic syndrome, which can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and headache.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed with transfusions and other medications.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may increase the risk of bleeding if not managed with vitamin K and other medications.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, which needs to be investigated and managed promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue labetalol IV and titrate to achieve a blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg.
2. Continue PD and monitor for adequate function.
3. Start albuterol nebs q6prn for asthma symptoms.
4. Continue lasix and other diuretics to manage heart failure and pulmonary edema.
5. Start prednisone and cellcept to manage asthma and prevent rejection.
6. Resume renalgel and calcitriol to manage anemia and bone disease.
7. Monitor INR and consider vitamin K therapy to manage elevated INR.
8. Trend CBC and consider antibiotics if infection is suspected.
9. Monitor patient's symptoms and adjust medications as needed to manage uremic syndrome, anemia, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema.  Very difficult to control.
   - follow renal recs - ? aliskerin, minoxidil
   - attempt to wean labetalol gtt
   - uptitrate labetalol as needed, currently on 200 mg po TID
   - continue clonidine patch
   - continue PD
   - SBP goal 150-160
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   - albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   - continue PD
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   - PD
   - continue prednisone and cellcept
   - appreciate renal recs
   - resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   possible source.  Viral URI ispossible but given lack of fever/myalgias
   flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - trend cbc
   - hold off on antibiotics for now
   - CIS
   # N/V: Improved with bp control, tolerating po
s, ruled out for ACS
   - zofran and ativan prn
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - change PPI to po daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   - Procrit per renal
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,
   now resolved
   - dilaudid to pain control
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shortness of breath, nausea, and headache, which were diagnosed as a hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema. Her blood pressure was difficult to control, and she required multiple doses of labetalol and hydralazine. She also has a history of asthma, which may have contributed to her presentation. Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated INR, which are likely related to her underlying kidney disease and dialysis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure was difficult to control, and she required multiple doses of labetalol and hydralazine. This could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or renal damage.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled. This could lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Asthma: The patient's diagnosis of asthma may have contributed to her presentation, and it is essential to continue her treatment for this condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her kidney disease is not managed properly. This could lead to further complications such as heart failure or decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to her underlying kidney disease or a secondary infection. It is essential to monitor her white blood cell count and treat any underlying infections promptly.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be related to her nutritional status or liver disease. It is essential to monitor her INR and treat any bleeding complications promptly.
7. Kidney disease: The patient's kidney disease may worsen if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled. This could lead to further complications such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or the need for dialysis.
8. Uremic symptoms: The patient's uremic symptoms may worsen if her kidney disease is not managed properly. This could lead to further complications such as seizures, confusion, or coma.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her blood pressure, kidney function, and underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration, with a history of CABG and ongoing hypertension despite being weaned off labetalol. The patient's blood pressure remains high, especially when they dwell. Renal team has increased clonidine to 0.4mg daily and resumed lasix and lisinopril, but is limited by the patient's heart rate. The patient has also received hydralazine 25mg PO q6h. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 67bpm, and blood pressure of 142/84mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% and no oxygen delivery device.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is -470mL, which may indicate fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is 12.7mg/dL, which may indicate renal dysfunction. This can increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and they have a history of sepsis. This increases the risk of infection, which can lead to septic shock, organ failure, and death.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, which can increase the risk of respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
6. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can increase the risk of respiratory compromise, pleuritic chest pain, and infection.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can increase the risk of recurrent bleeding, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   now off labetalol gtt and on po medications.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Difficult to control but has been off
   labetalol gtt since 5 pm on [**8-31**]. Added clonidiine, lasix, Lisinopril
   and hydralazine. SBPs 150s mostly, sometimes 170s.
   - appreciate renal recs
 okay to start aliskerin
   - continue labetalol, clonidine, lasix, Lisinopril and hydralazine
   - could uptitrate hydralazine and / or add aliskerin
   - continue PD
   - SBP goal 150-160
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR.
   - albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   - continue PD
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   - continue PD
   - continue prednisone and cellcept
   - appreciate renal recs
   -  continue renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   possible source.  Viral URI Is possible but given lack of
   fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - trend cbc
   - hold off on antibiotics
   - CIS
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - change PPI to po daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   - Procrit per renal (holding due to HTN, but may be able to give today)
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.
   - trend INR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertensive emergency, asthma, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
* She was initially treated with labetalol, but was weaned off it due to high blood pressure (SBP) and concerns about heart rate (HR).
* The patient's SBP remains elevated, especially when she dwells, and renal wanted to increase labetalol, but is limited by HR.
* The patient was started on clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine to control her blood pressure.
* Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% and no oxygen therapy.
* The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated INR, which are being monitored and managed accordingly.
* Her chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema, which has improved, and bilateral pleural effusions, which are stable.
* The patient is being treated with antibiotics for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), and a gram stain and fluid culture are pending.
* The patient's medications include antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, and medications for hypertension, asthma, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac damage, stroke, or kidney damage.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient's mild pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated, leading to further complications, such as heart failure or worsening kidney function.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
* Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may indicate a bleeding risk, which can be exacerbated by anticoagulant therapy.
* UTI: The patient's UTI may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to further complications, such as sepsis or kidney damage.

Based on this information, I recommend that the patient's treatment plan be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to manage her hypertensive emergency, anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated INR."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache, and was found to have a hypertensive emergency. She has a history of failed kidney transplant and is on peritoneal dialysis. She was initially on labetalol, but was weaned off due to high blood pressure, especially when she dwells. She was started on clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine to control her blood pressure. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 142/84 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with a flow rate of 10 L/min and an oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains high, especially when she dwells, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac damage, stroke, or renal failure.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has improved, but it may worsen if her blood pressure is not controlled.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, which may lead to sepsis or organ failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences further bleeding or if her kidney function declines.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be a sign of liver dysfunction or malnutrition, which may lead to bleeding or other complications.
6. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may worsen if her pulmonary edema or heart failure worsens.
7. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may worsen if her kidney function declines or if she experiences further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to control her hypertension.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and adjust her respiratory support as necessary to improve her oxygenation.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and adjust her antibiotic regimen as necessary to prevent infection.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusion regimen as necessary to maintain her hemoglobin levels.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's elevated INR and adjust her anticoagulation regimen as necessary to prevent bleeding.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's dyspnea and adjust her respiratory support as necessary to improve her oxygenation.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's ESRD and adjust her dialysis regimen as necessary to maintain her kidney function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   FINDINGS: Status post CABG, unchanged.
   The mild pulmonary edema has improved and bilateral pleural effusions
   are
   stable, which are moderate on the left and small on the right side. No
   new
   consolidation or pneumothorax.
   IMPRESSION:
   Improved pulmonary edema with stable bilateral pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   now off labetalol gtt and on po medications.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Difficult to control but has been off
   labetalol gtt since 5 pm on [**8-31**]. Added clonidiine, lasix, Lisinopril
   and hydralazine. SBPs 150s mostly, sometimes 170s.
   - appreciate renal recs
 okay to start aliskerin
   - continue labetalol, clonidine, lasix, Lisinopril and hydralazine
   - could uptitrate hydralazine and / or add aliskerin
   - continue PD
   - SBP goal 150-160
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR.
   - albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   - continue PD
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   - continue PD
   - continue prednisone and cellcept
   - appreciate renal recs
   -  continue renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: downward trending without e/o infection
   - f/u culture data
   - trend cbc
   - hold off on antibiotics
   - CIS
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - change PPI to po daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   - Procrit per renal (holding due to HTN, but may be able to give today)
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.
   - trend INR

Based on the 24-hour events and patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains high, especially when they dwell, and is not well-controlled despite the addition of clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine. This may lead to further complications such as cardiac damage, cerebral edema, or renal damage.
2. Pulmonary edema and heart failure: The patient's CXR shows mild pulmonary edema, which may worsen with continued volume overload. This could lead to respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and while it is trending downward, it is still above normal. This may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and they are on procrit for anemia of chronic disease. However, their recent hematemesis and emesis may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen their anemia.
5. ESRD: The patient's chronic kidney disease is likely to progress, and their current PD therapy may not be sufficient to manage their fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's AG metabolic acidosis may worsen if their kidney function continues to decline, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory failure.
7. Potential bleeding complications: The patient's elevated INR and recent hematemesis and emesis may indicate a risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."
