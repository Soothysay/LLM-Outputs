   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to combination of
   large left sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  No
   evidence of obstructive airways disease on exam to explain her
   hypercarbia.  Also no clear evidence to support acute change such as PE
   to cause her symptoms.  Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib
   w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No
   preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or
   empyema.
   -IP to place pigtail drain at bedside today to relieve pleural effusion
   and hopefully allow for re-expansion of L lung
   -start lasix gtt for improved diuresis
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol
   -continue to support nutritional status
   -send pleural fluid for analysis
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -restart coumadin tomorrow if doing well post [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -start lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis -1-2L
   -f/u [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete prn
   -monitor bicarb, may need to hold off on diuresis if appears to be
   intravascularly depleted (does have slight creatinine/HCO3 bump today)
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #C.diff - diagnosed during her recent admission, started on flagyl, no
   apparent complications.
   - continue flagyl to be completed on [**2101-11-15**] (7 days after ampicillin
   stopped)
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   - continue multivitamin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 71-year-old female, is currently in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis following a fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression, as well as a history of DVT, IVC filter placement, DM2, Afib with large L-sided effusion, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient is hypotensive and has a small L apical pneumothorax, which was confirmed by a stat CXR.
* The patient became tachypneic and uncomfortable during attempts to place a central line, and the procedure was abandoned.
* The patient has a large L-sided pleural effusion, which is likely due to a combination of Afib with RVR, diastolic dysfunction, and poor nutritional status.
* The patient has anasarca, likely due to diastolic CHF caused by Afib with RVR and poor nutritional status.
* The patient has skin breakdown, likely due to poor nutritional status, anasarca, and new paralysis.
* The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to the large L-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening of the pneumothorax
* Respiratory failure due to the large L-sided pleural effusion
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to Afib with RVR
* Worsening of anasarca and skin breakdown
* Development of DVT or PE due to immobility and poor nutritional status
* Infection of the pleural effusion or skin breakdown

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Placement of a pigtail drain at bedside to relieve the pleural effusion and allow for re-expansion of the L lung
* Start of lasix gtt for improved diuresis
* Continuation of rate control with metoprolol
* Support of nutritional status
* Send of pleural fluid for analysis
* Transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis
* Restart of coumadin tomorrow if doing well post procedure
* Start of lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis of -1-2L
* F/u of lytes and repletion as needed
* Monitoring of bicarb and possible holding off on diuresis if appears to be intravascularly depleted
* Continuation of support of nutrition
* Continue flagyl to be completed on [**2101-11-15**]
* Continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
* Continue multivitamin and f/u of wound care reccs."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to combination of
   large left sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  No
   evidence of obstructive airways disease on exam to explain her
   hypercarbia.  Also no clear evidence to support acute change such as PE
   to cause her symptoms.  Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib
   w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No
   preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or
   empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old female, is a morbidly obese individual with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, DVT, and IVC filter placement. She was admitted with a large left-sided pleural effusion, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload. She underwent a chest tube placement and was started on metoprolol for rate control. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and skin breakdown.

Current condition:

* The patient is currently in the ICU with a chest tube in place and is receiving oxygen therapy.
* She is experiencing hypotension and has a history of poor nutritional status, which may be contributing to her anasarca.
* Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions.
* She has a history of skin breakdown, which may be related to her poor nutritional status and anasarca.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
* Infection: The patient's skin breakdown and anasarca may increase her risk of developing infections.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anasarca may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload may lead to cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status may lead to further complications if not addressed.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
* Implement measures to prevent and manage skin breakdown, such as turning and repositioning the patient, and using pressure-reducing devices.
* Address the patient's anasarca by starting lasix gtt and repleting electrolytes as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and consider restarting coumadin tomorrow if doing well.
* Provide nutritional support to the patient, including a diabetic diet and multivitamin, and consider starting a nutritional supplement.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
* Consider transferring the patient to a rehabilitation facility once her medical condition is stable."

 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   71 yo female with complicated recent medical history resulting in LE
   paralysis bilaterally and now admitted with worsening hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  This is likely related to some background
   ventilatory compromise with co-existing disease in addition to what is
   likey both a combination of lung collapse as well as pleural effusion
   in the left lung.  The mode to support her will be a combination of
   non-invasive ventilatory support as well as drainage of effusions.
   Respiratory Failure-
   Thoracentesis today on the left, Will need to re-evaluate post tap for
   residual collapse
   -Will consider CT scan following tap of fluid when parenchyma can be
   visualized

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including lower extremity paralysis bilaterally, who was admitted with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, pleural effusion in the left lung, and impaired skin integrity. The patient requires respiratory support, including non-invasive ventilatory support and drainage of effusions.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Dyspnea, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and pleural effusion in the left lung.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and a history of deep venous thrombosis.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 429 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to a combination of lung collapse, pleural effusion, and background ventilatory compromise. The patient requires drainage of effusions and non-invasive ventilatory support.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis and is at risk for further thrombotic events. The patient requires heparin prophylaxis and close monitoring for signs of thrombosis.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control and anticoagulation with heparin.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient has C. difficile colitis, which requires treatment with Flagyl.
* Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which requires close monitoring for signs of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
* Malnutrition: The patient requires nutrition support to prevent malnutrition and promote wound healing.
* Glycemic control: The patient requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status to prevent complications and promote recovery."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complicated medical history, admitted with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity paralysis bilaterally, and acute pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has undergone chest tube placement with a pigtail drain and has had a small pneumothorax (PTX) seen. The pleural effusion on the left lung was drained via thoracentesis, and the patient will need to be monitored for residual collapse and potential PTX on the right lung.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's medical conditions include DVT, pleural effusion, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is at risk for sepsis, and a low threshold for broad-spectrum antibiotics should be maintained.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Non-invasive ventilatory support and drainage of effusions.
2. Close monitoring for PTX on the right lung and potential residual collapse.
3. Restarting heparin post-thoracentesis.
4. Ongoing diuresis and nutrition.
5. Hemodynamic monitoring, including central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.
6. Alternative diagnosis for hypotension, including sepsis, but with a low threshold for broad-spectrum antibiotics.
7. Continuation of Flagyl for C. diff colitis.
8. Restarting heparin post-procedure for atrial fibrillation.
9. Rate control for atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure due to pleural effusion and PTX.
2. Sepsis due to impaired skin integrity and potential bacterial colonization.
3. Hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy.
4. C. diff colitis worsening due to continued antibiotic therapy.
5. Atrial fibrillation worsening due to inadequate rate control.
6. Hypotension due to sepsis, cardiac failure, or hemorrhage.
7. Thrombocytopenia worsening due to continued bleeding or bone marrow suppression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to combination of
   large left sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  No
   evidence of obstructive airways disease on exam to explain her
   hypercarbia.  Also no clear evidence to support acute change such as PE
   to cause her symptoms.  Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib
   w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No
   preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or
   empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   -IP to place second pigtail catheter in R side today
   - Chest CT after procedure to further evaluate underlying lung
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol
   -continue to support nutritional status
   - consider Lasix gtt if BP tolerates today
   - f/u CXR after [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -restart coumadin tomorrow if doing well post [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -start lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis -1-2L
   -f/u [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete prn
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   ..
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   - continue multivitamin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis, s/p fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression, history of DVT, and DM2. She has a large left-sided pleural effusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Afib with RVR, and her nutritional status is poor. She has multiple areas of skin breakdown and anasarca.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's large left-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient's skin breakdown and anasarca increase her risk of developing infections.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's Afib with RVR and diastolic dysfunction may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac function.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status may lead to further complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Skin breakdown progression: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications, such as infections and decreased quality of life.
6. Hypercarbic respiratory failure exacerbation: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory compromise.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of DVT and Afib with RVR may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac function.
8. Kidney damage: The patient's anasarca and poor nutritional status may increase her risk of developing kidney damage and acute kidney injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Implement measures to prevent and treat skin breakdown, such as proper wound care and nutrition.
3. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
4. Continue to manage the patient's Afib with RVR and diastolic dysfunction with rate control medication and consider Lasix gtt if BP tolerates.
5. Consider restarting coumadin tomorrow if doing well post-thoracentesis.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
7. Continue to support the patient's cardiovascular health with stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider anticoagulation therapy.
8. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent kidney damage and acute kidney injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis.  No evidence of obstructive
   airways disease on exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed no PT
   but had multifocal pneumonia.  Effusion most likely due to combination
   of Afib w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional
   status.  No preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant
   effusion or empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   CXR in evening shows apical pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail
   placement)

   #Hypotension: Improved with 2L of NS last night.  Patient with UOP last
   night usually >30cc/hr.  Hypotension likely a combination of poor PO
   intake over last 48 hours, aggressive diuresis at rehab facility, and
   high output from pigtail catheters (R side produced 1L fluid in approx
   10 hours yesterday)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis.  No evidence of obstructive
   airways disease on exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed no PT
   but had multifocal pneumonia.  Effusion most likely due to combination
   of Afib w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional
   status.  No preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant
   effusion or empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   CXR in evening shows apical pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail
   placement)
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course since patient afebrile, not producing sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample
   - blood culture
   -urine legionella Cx
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved with 2L of NS last night.  Patient with UOP last
   night usually >30cc/hr.  Hypotension likely a combination of poor PO
   intake over last 48 hours, aggressive diuresis at rehab facility, and
   high output from pigtail catheters (R side produced 1L fluid in approx
   10 hours yesterday)
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -start lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis -1-2L
   -f/u [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete prn
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   ..
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, bilateral lower extremity paralysis, and a history of fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression. She has a large left-sided pleural effusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. Her lung exam shows bronchial breath sounds over both lungs, with decreased breath sounds over the left apex. She has a pleural effusion on the right side, which is exudative, and a transudative effusion on the left side.

The patient has a history of skin breakdown, which is likely due to poor nutritional status and anasarca. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia and is taking medication for it.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/μL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 352 K/μL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and repeat CXR to evaluate for worsening pneumothorax.
2. Hypotension: 500 cc NS boluses as needed, encourage PO intake, and maintenance fluids.
3. Afib with RVR: Continue metoprolol.
4. h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis, and restart coumadin when stable.
5. Anasarca: Start lasix gtt if stable following procedure, and replete electrolytes and fluids as needed.
6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.
7. Skin breakdown: Continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs, and f/u wound care reccs.
8. Hyperlipidemia: Continue fenofibrate and pravastatin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows apical pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient's CXR shows a pneumothorax on the left side, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not treated promptly.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infection.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch, 121.5 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity, and pleural effusion. Over the past 24 hours, a chest tube was placed on the right side, which drained 1000cc of bloody fluid. The patient also had a multi-lumen catheter placed, which was used to drain the pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has a significant pleural effusion on the right side, which is exudative in nature. This may lead to respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, which may be attributed to the hypotensive episode earlier in the day. This may indicate a potential cardiac or vasculature issue that needs to be addressed.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke or pulmonary embolism.
4. Deep venous thrombosis: The patient's history of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism or other thromboembolic events.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of infection or other complications.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's pleural effusion and potential respiratory compromise may increase the risk of respiratory failure or other respiratory complications.
7. Cardiac issues: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential hypotension may indicate underlying cardiac issues that need to be addressed.
8. Nutritional concerns: The patient's recent blood transfusions and potential fluid imbalance may indicate nutritional concerns that need to be addressed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pleural effusion and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider echocardiography to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and potential cardiac issues.
3. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac issues with anticoagulation therapy and other medications as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and take steps to prevent further impairment.
5. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide appropriate nutritional support as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and take steps to prevent further hypotension."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   1. Resp Distress: overall improvement in resp status with drainage of
   effusions down to 2 liters nasal cannula. Post tap underlying lungs
   with extensive GGO- given her prolonged hosp stays and new hypotension
   will Rx for nosocomial PNA with Vanco Levo and gather data. It is
   notable however that the desire to treat is driven by abnomrla CT and
   her relative hypotension not truly a clinical case of cough and phlegm
   so this course will need to be evaluated on a dialy basis. IP had
   queried about BAL but she would need sedation and BP are borderline
   will try for expectortation and if fails can re evaluate later in day
   or early AM.
   2. Hypotension: MAPs drifting down in 50
 has been fluid responsive.
   Likely combination of hypovolemia
 poor pos and known pHTN, we will
   bolus another liter watch CVP and UOP. Could be early sepsis as above
   and as such we will plan for Rx with ABX and pan culture
   3. Bilat pleural effusions: CT in place, persistent apical PTX, could

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of traumatic fall and paralysis, who presents with respiratory failure due to bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and diffuse ground glass opacities on chest CT. 

The patient has undergone chest tube placement on the right with 1 liter output, and a multi-lumen catheter was started. She has been receiving IV fluids and has been stable hemodynamically, with a low-range blood pressure. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved with drainage of effusions, and she is currently receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula. However, her underlying lungs show extensive ground glass opacities, which may indicate nosocomial pneumonia. The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the plan is to start antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and levofloxacin. 

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of hypovolemia, poor perfusion, and known hypertension. She may require further fluid boluses and will be monitored closely for signs of sepsis. 

The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and apical pneumothoraces are being managed with chest tubes, and she may require further interventions to re-expand her lungs. 

The patient has severe skin breakdown, and a wound care consult has been ordered. 

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition through a per oral diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's underlying lungs show extensive ground glass opacities, which may indicate nosocomial pneumonia. 
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to her prolonged hospital stay and respiratory support.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension may be due to early sepsis, and she will be monitored closely for signs of sepsis.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient's apical pneumothoraces may require further interventions to re-expand her lungs.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's severe skin breakdown requires close monitoring and wound care.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis, and prophylaxis is being provided to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has undergone a chest tube placement on the right side with 1 liter output, and a multi-lumen catheter has been started. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg. The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis, lower extremity pleural effusion, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Nosocomial Pneumonia (NPN): Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay and new hypotension, there is a risk of developing NPN. The patient's underlying lung disease and prolonged intubation make them more susceptible to NPN.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of early sepsis. The patient's respiratory distress, pleural effusions, and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's pleural effusions and apical pneumothorax may increase the risk of developing PE.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or heart failure.
5. Wound Complications: The patient's severe skin breakdown increases the risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or further skin breakdown.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and prolonged intubation may increase the risk of developing respiratory failure.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function. The patient should receive antibiotics for potential sepsis, and wound care should be prioritized to prevent further skin breakdown."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual weighing 121.5 kg, admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation (AF), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, pleural effusion, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, and the patient is receiving 1 liter of IV fluid per hour.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 429 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 167 mg/dL
* Other lab results include PT/PTT/INR: 19.6/150.0/1.8, and a differential white blood cell count showing 75.4% neutrophils, 11.3% lymphocytes, and 4.3% monocytes.

The patient's imaging studies show a pleural effusion on the left side, which has not changed on repeat chest X-ray.

The patient's physical examination is significant for hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and pleural effusion increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's impaired skin integrity and pleural effusion increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression: The patient's existing DVT in the lower extremity increases the risk of progression to pulmonary embolism.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and impaired platelet function increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's decreased blood pressure and increased creatinine level increase the risk of developing renal dysfunction.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired gut function and impaired nutritional status increase the risk of malnutrition.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Urine: Legionella antigen negative; pleural fluid
 no microbes, no
   growth
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   -consider stopping flagyl pending culture results
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with 50 cc output over 24 hrs
 will
   plan to seal and eventually remove.  Right pigtail with 500 cc output
   over 24 hrs.  Will allow it to continue to drain.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - on heparin gtt
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -holding lasix secondary to hypotension
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   -          continue multivitamin
   -          IVF boluses in 500 cc increments to support BP
   #Prophylaxis: wound care, heparin gtt, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum

   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   -consider stopping flagyl pending culture results
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with 50 cc output over 24 hrs
 will
   plan to seal and eventually remove.  Right pigtail with 500 cc output
   over 24 hrs.  Will allow it to continue to drain.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, epidural hematoma, and cord compression following a fall. She has been admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and large left-sided effusion. She has also been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and levoquin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension and has received 500cc boluses of normal saline. She has a history of DVT and has an IVC filter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of worsening pneumonia and development of complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated with rate control medications, but there is a risk of worsening cardiac function and development of complications such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Large Left-Sided Effusion: The patient has a large left-sided effusion, which may be causing respiratory distress and compromising her lung function. There is a risk of worsening effusion and development of complications such as pleural empyema or mediastinitis.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to a combination of factors including poor oral intake, high output from pigtail catheters, and underlying cardiac dysfunction. There is a risk of worsening hypotension and development of complications such as organ dysfunction or shock.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which may be due to poor nutritional status, anasarca, and new paralysis. There is a risk of worsening skin breakdown and development of complications such as infection or sepsis.
6. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which may be due to underlying cardiac dysfunction, poor nutritional status, and fluid overload. There is a risk of worsening anasarca and development of complications such as respiratory distress or cardiac failure.
7. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and has an IVC filter in place. There is a risk of recurrent DVT or pulmonary embolism.
8. IVC Filter: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which may be causing complications such as filter migration or thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis.  No evidence of obstructive
   airways disease on exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed no PT
   but had multifocal pneumonia.  Effusion most likely due to combination
   of Afib w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional
   status.  No preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant
   effusion or empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   CXR in evening shows apical pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail
   placement)
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course since patient afebrile, not producing sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample
   - blood culture
   -urine legionella Cx
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved with 2L of NS last night.  Patient with UOP last
   night usually >30cc/hr.  Hypotension likely a combination of poor PO
   intake over last 48 hours, aggressive diuresis at rehab facility, and
   high output from pigtail catheters (R side produced 1L fluid in approx
   10 hours yesterday)
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -start lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis -1-2L
   -f/u [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete prn
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   ..
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   - continue multivitamin
   #Prophylaxis: stress ulcer prophylaxis, will start heparin gtt today

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including bilateral lower extremity paralysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and anasarca (edema).

The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis. She has a small pneumothorax on the left side, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also a concern, with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be contributing to her hypotension. She has a history of DVT and PE, and an IVC filter was placed to prevent further thrombotic events.

The patient's nutritional status is poor, with a history of malnutrition and anasarca. She has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which may be related to her poor nutritional status and anasarca.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of kidney dysfunction, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mmol/L and a sodium level of 138 mmol/L.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may be contributing to her hypotension and cardiac failure.
3. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of DVT and PE, and an IVC filter was placed to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are abnormal, indicating kidney dysfunction.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which may be related to her poor nutritional status and anasarca.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is poor, which may be contributing to her skin breakdown and other complications.
7. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may be contributing to her respiratory distress and skin breakdown.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Cardiovascular support: The patient will continue to receive cardiovascular support, including medications to control her atrial fibrillation and rate control.
3. Nutritional support: The patient will continue to receive nutritional support, including a diabetic diet and supplements as needed.
4. Wound care: The patient will receive wound care, including debridement and dressing changes, to promote healing and prevent further skin breakdown.
5. Thromboprophylaxis: The patient will continue to receive thromboprophylaxis, including heparin and warfarin, to prevent further thrombotic events.
6. Monitoring: The patient will continue to be monitored closely for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, kidney dysfunction, skin breakdown, and malnutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity. The patient's condition has worsened, with progressive ventilatory compromise, bilateral effusions, and pulmonary infiltrates on computed tomography (CT) scan. She was started on treatment for pneumonia over the weekend, but the effusions are exudative and without evidence of active infection.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 16 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 6.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 429 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 35 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Pneumonia treatment with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for 7 days
* Bilateral pleural effusions drainage with chest tubes
* Physical therapy to help ambulate the patient and get her out of bed
* Anticoagulation with heparin for atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis
* Nutrition and skin care support

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Pneumonia progression and worsening respiratory failure
* Pleural effusions leading to respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure
* Deep vein thrombosis progression and potential pulmonary embolism
* Atrial fibrillation leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest
* Skin integrity issues due to immobility and potential pressure ulcers
* Worsening of diabetes mellitus due to inadequate glycemic control
* Impaired chest wall function leading to respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          250 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with increased output, IP changed
   back to suction.  Cont. right on suction.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - on heparin gtt
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -holding lasix secondary to hypotension
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # h/o C. diff infection
 cont. flagyl through [**11-18**].
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   -          continue multivitamin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU with bilateral lower extremity paralysis, s/p fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT, DM2, and Afib with large L-sided effusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of IVC filter placement and is currently on heparin. She has a chest tube and pigtail catheters in place, and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a low hematocrit and is at risk for bleeding. She has multiple areas of skin breakdown and anasarca, and is being treated for these conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia may worsen due to the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, and may require more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Infection: The patient's urine culture is positive for GNR, and she has a history of C. diff infection. She may be at risk for developing a nosocomial infection, particularly in the setting of her compromised immune system.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low hematocrit and history of bleeding complications make her at risk for bleeding complications, particularly with the use of heparin.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's multiple areas of skin breakdown may worsen due to her poor nutritional status and anasarca, and may require more aggressive wound care.
5. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may worsen due to her poor nutritional status and may require more aggressive treatment, such as diuretics.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to her poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters, and may require more aggressive treatment, such as vasopressors.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's Afib with RVR may worsen due to her poor nutritional status and may require more aggressive treatment, such as rate control medications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, and may require more aggressive respiratory support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   -consider stopping flagyl pending culture results
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with 50 cc output over 24 hrs
 will
   plan to seal and eventually remove.  Right pigtail with 500 cc output
   over 24 hrs.  Will allow it to continue to drain.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - on heparin gtt
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -holding lasix secondary to hypotension
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   -          continue multivitamin

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation with large left-sided effusion and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with bilateral pleural effusions, multifocal pneumonia, and anasarca. She has been treated with antibiotics and has been on mechanical ventilation. Her condition has been stable, but she has had some fluctuations in her vital signs and has required multiple interventions to manage her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is a serious complication that can lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and even death.
2. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the body. This can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and even death.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a condition characterized by the buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and even death.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a condition characterized by an irregular heartbeat. This can lead to stroke, heart failure, and even death.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a serious complication that can lead to pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and even death.
6. IVC filter placement: The patient has an IVC filter placed, which is a device designed to prevent blood clots from traveling to the lungs. However, this device can also cause complications such as filter migration, embolism, and even death.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which is a serious complication that can lead to infection, sepsis, and even death.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is a condition characterized by high levels of lipids in the blood. This can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and even death.
9. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a serious condition that can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and even death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing serious medical complications, and it is essential to monitor her condition closely and provide aggressive treatment to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with admission with hypoxemic respiratory compromise in
   the setting of bilateral pleural effusions.  This is in the setting of
   significant and chronic compromise in the setting of baseline
   paralysis.  She has had continued high volume output from chest tubes
   bilaterally
the source of these effusions remains to be defined with
   confidence but it would appear that transudative effusionin the setting
   of low oncotic pressure may well be driving much of the pleural
   effusions presence.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Levo/Flagyl
   -Await culture results for any further modification of antibiotic
   dosing and will consider GNR
s in urine likely covered by current
   antibiotic dosing and will repeat
   2)Pleural Effusions-
   -Right chest tube
200cc in 6 hours, Left Chest Tube
250cc in 6 hours
   noted
   -Will need to follow up on chest tube drainage
   -[**Month (only) 51**] need to consider pleuradhesis if persistent drainge seen limiting
   ventilatory capacities.
   -Albumin to be re-checked and will follow up with nutrition
   3)DVT-Known in LE
   -ON Heparin gtt
   -Will transition back to coumadin dosing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with admission with hypoxemic respiratory compromise in
   the setting of bilateral pleural effusions.  This is in the setting of
   significant and chronic compromise in the setting of baseline
   paralysis.  She has had continued high volume output from chest tubes
   bilaterally
the source of these effusions remains to be defined with
   confidence but it would appear that transudative effusionin the setting
   of low oncotic pressure may well be driving much of the pleural
   effusions presence.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Levo/Flagyl
   -Await culture results for any further modification of antibiotic
   dosing and will consider GNR
s in urine likely covered by current
   antibiotic dosing and will repeat
   2)Pleural Effusions-
   -Right chest tube
200cc in 6 hours, Left Chest Tube
250cc in 6 hours
   noted
   -Will need to follow up on chest tube drainage
   -[**Month (only) 51**] need to consider pleuradhesis if persistent drainge seen limiting
   ventilatory capacities.
   -Albumin to be re-checked and will follow up with nutrition
   3)DVT-Known in LE
   -ON Heparin gtt
   -Will transition back to coumadin dosing
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and a history of chronic compromise due to baseline paralysis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's chest tube drainage is improving, with 200cc of drainage from the right chest tube and 250cc from the left chest tube over the past 6 hours. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 429 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly low calcium level of 7.8 mg/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal. 

The patient's microbiology results show the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in the urine, but the source of the pleural effusions remains to be defined. 

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for respiratory failure, monitoring chest tube drainage, and considering pleuradesis if drainage persists. The patient's DVT will be managed with heparin, and she will be transitioned back to coumadin dosing. The patient's additional issues to be addressed include edema, electrolyte and fluid disorder, diarrhea, impaired physical mobility, diabetes mellitus, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. 

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once her condition improves."
