   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   A/P: 85M with CAD, CHF EF 20%, VT s/p ICD, ESRD on HD, p/w dysphagia.
   .
   # Dysphagia:  This is most likely [**12-24**] obstruction and food impaction in
   esophagus.  Pt is comfortable and handling his secretions; however,
   prolonged food impaction carries a significant risk of eroding the
   esophagus and may cause rupture.
   - GI aware, plan for upper endoscopy
   - NPO
   - given elevated INR will  give FFP peri-operatively
   - obtain T& S, crossmatch 2 units
   .
   # Pre-procedure risk evaluation: Given the food impaction and known
   prior aspiration/dysphagia (Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS)
   rating of 4, moderate dysphagia), this patient is at particular risk of
   aspiration and will need intubation. As far as I can see from OMR, the
   patient has not been formally diagnosed with primary pulmonary disease.
   He was a long-term smoker, quit 20 years ago. He did have PFT's in [**2137**]
   w/o any evidence of obstructive disease but showing mild restrictive
   ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity suggesting an
   interstitial process and possible amiodarone toxicity. He has chronic
   effusions and is on 2L home O2 suggestive of underlying lung disease-
   both of which may complicate extubation.  However, he has never had
   symptoms from pulmonary disease and hospitalizations for respiratory
   distress have been largely related to aspiration and CHF.  In addition
   to the aspiration risk, patient has multiple cardiac comorbidities that
   place him at risk for peri-procedural MI. Having said that, endsocopy
   is a low risk procedure itself. At this time, he appears to be stable
   and at baseline from a cardiac and pulmonary perspective with stable
   effusion, no CHF exacerbation and no new hypoxia. Although the patient
   is moderate/high risk, the benefit of removing a food impaction
   urgently appears to out weight the risk of  aspiration and difficulty
   extubating.
   - proceed with EGD
   - ideally would give long acting perioperative beta-blocker but can
   consider short acting BB instead given NPO status.
   - discuss with anesthesia and family risk of difficulty with extubation
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - contact renal for HD
   .
   # CAD s/p multiple stents:  No active angina.  has been several years
   since the last stent, the patient has not been taking the aspirin since
   [**11-16**]
   - restart meds when can take PO
   .
   # H/o VT s/p ICD:
   - restart Mexiletine and BB when able to take PO's
   .
   # Chronic systolic HF:  currently euvolemic
   - restart metoprolol and lisinopril when able to take PO's
   .
   # anemia:  hct 34.7, has baseline anemia
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - hold  levothyroxine  until taking Po
   .
   # Factor V leiden: INR supratherapeutic
   - hold coumadin and trend INR
   -                      give FFP peri-procedure, but will not reverse
   with vit K

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of chronic diseases, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and a history of ventricular tachycardia with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. He was admitted to the ICU due to food impaction and was started on invasive ventilation. He underwent an endoscopy procedure to remove the food impaction and was found to have a moderate dysphagia. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, and his vital signs are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his moderate dysphagia and the presence of a food impaction in the esophagus. This risk is increased by his history of aspiration and dysphagia.
2. Esophageal Rupture: The prolonged food impaction carries a significant risk of eroding the esophagus and causing rupture.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has multiple cardiac comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, and a history of ventricular tachycardia. He is at risk for peri-procedural myocardial infarction (MI) due to the endoscopy procedure.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has chronic effusions and is on home oxygen therapy, which may complicate extubation. He is also at risk for respiratory distress due to his underlying lung disease.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of dysphagia and is at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and bowel obstruction.
6. Renal Complications: The patient has end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and is at risk for further renal complications, including acute kidney injury or worsening of his chronic kidney disease.
7. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) due to his use of warfarin, which increases his risk of bleeding complications during the endoscopy procedure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of food impaction. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to invasive ventilation and endoscopy to remove the food impaction. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 99/45 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% and is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination is notable for an endotracheal tube, with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 137 K/uL, and creatinine of 5.4 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The patient has also had a ventricular tachycardia episode in the past and has been prescribed mexiletine and beta blockers.

The patient's plan includes restarting diet at clears ADAT today, restarting medications for coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, and hypothyroidism, and restarting coumadin for factor V Leiden.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway and potential for aspiration of gastric contents or other substances.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's reliance on mechanical ventilation and potential for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and chronic systolic heart failure, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Renal complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease and potential for worsening renal function.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of food impaction and potential for further gastrointestinal complications.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's presence in the ICU and potential for hospital-acquired infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential for neurological complications such as seizures or brain damage.
8. Hematological complications: The patient's history of anemia and potential for worsening anemia or bleeding complications."

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic systolic heart failure, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, was admitted to the ICU for food impaction and subsequent dysphagia. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [**2141-11-19**] and was successfully extubated on [**2141-11-20**] without sequelae. He was restarted on all home medications, except for warfarin, which was held due to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.9. The patient reports a new cough, which started prior to hospitalization, and is occasionally productive. He also has a sore throat since the EGD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's cough and occasional productive cough could be a sign of pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients with chronic respiratory disease.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of factor V Leiden mutation increase the risk of thrombosis, which could lead to serious complications if left untreated.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of food impaction and dysphagia increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulants.
4. Infection: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and dialysis increases the risk of infection, which could be complicated by the patient's immunocompromised state.
5. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent food impaction could exacerbate his heart failure, leading to decompensation and worsening of his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cough and respiratory status closely for signs of pneumonia.
2. Repeat INR and adjust warfarin therapy as necessary to maintain a therapeutic range.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely for signs of bleeding or obstruction.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk factors and provide appropriate antibiotics if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's heart failure status closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent decompensation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, dysphagia, and factor V Leiden.

The patient was extubated without sequelae and is currently tolerating clear liquids and solids. He was restarted on most of his home medications, except for warfarin due to elevated INR. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and is being monitored for oxygen saturation.

Physically, the patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/47 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 166 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 32 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 101 mEq/L
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 4.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.9%

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Restarting medications for coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and factor V Leiden
* Continuing hemodialysis
* Follow-up with gastroenterology in two weeks for possible repeat upper endoscopy
* Restarting diet at clear liquids and solids
* Monitoring oxygen saturation and blood pressure

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to underlying coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure
* Renal failure due to inadequate dialysis or underlying kidney disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to dysphagia and food impaction
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility
* Thrombotic events due to factor V Leiden and prolonged immobilization
* Anemia due to underlying kidney disease and chronic bleeding
* Hypothyroidism due to underlying thyroid disease

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical plan closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."
