You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypertensive urgency requiring Nicardipine infusion. The patient's condition has been stable, and he is currently off Nicardipine. The plan is to control hypertension with oral and intravenous medications, and to monitor blood pressure and neurological status every 4 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and there is a risk of further hypertensive crisis if not properly managed.
2. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient has a history of subdural hematoma (SDH) and is at risk of increased intracranial pressure due to hypertension.
3. Worsening of peripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy, and the use of certain medications, such as metoprolol, may exacerbate this condition.
4. Development of arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the use of certain medications, such as Nicardipine, may cause arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further imbalance if not properly monitored and managed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to his compromised immune system and the use of central lines.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the use of certain medications, such as Coumadin, may increase this risk.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is abnormal, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
9. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and there is a risk of cardiac failure if not properly managed.
10. Kidney injury: The patient has a history of ESRD, and there is a risk of further kidney injury if not properly managed."

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of ESRD on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. He presented to the hospital with a severe head injury (SDH) following a fall and was treated for hypertensive urgency. However, his blood pressure became hypotensive, likely due to the stacking of multiple blood pressure medications. He has been febrile, with a temperature of 101.1°F, and has undergone a central line placement. His laboratory results show abnormal values, including elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and further hypotension may lead to organ damage, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, are abnormal and may require correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Blood Pressure Control: The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control due to the stacking of multiple medications, which may lead to further complications, such as hypertensive crisis or hypotension.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
6. Infection: The patient's central line placement and urinary catheter may increase the risk of infection, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and urinary tract infection (UTI).
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a mild respiratory acidosis, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, and he may be at risk for further neurological decline due to his head injury and potential sepsis.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bowel regimen and stress ulcer prophylaxis may be inadequate, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presented to the emergency department with a subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency following a fall. The patient was treated with antihypertensives and hemodialysis, resulting in hypotension, although sepsis was not ruled out. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Echocardiogram findings indicate mild left atrial dilation, moderate right atrial dilation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is normal, and there is no evidence of ventricular septal defect or aortic stenosis. The patient's pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is borderline, and there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 156/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, mild neutropenia, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's recent fall and possible sepsis, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and the patient is at risk for developing a hypertensive crisis, which could lead to cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's echocardiogram findings indicate mild left atrial dilation and moderate right atrial dilation, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac tamponade.
4. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's subdural hematoma could lead to neurological deficits or death if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's recent fall and possible sepsis make the patient at risk for developing infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition could lead to delayed wound healing, decreased immune function, and increased risk of infection.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, type II diabetes, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. He presented to the hospital with a subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency after a fall. He was treated with antihypertensives and received 3.5L of hemodialysis, which resulted in hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 156/66 mmHg and a heart rate of 71 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 261 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he is at risk for further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or renal damage.
2. Sepsis: Although not ruled out, the patient's fever and white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Subdural hematoma: The patient's SDH is stable, but further bleeding or expansion could occur, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, combined with his recent fall, increases his risk for stroke and thromboembolic events.
5. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and his blood pressure fluctuations may impact his renal function and overall health.
6. Diabetes: The patient's type II diabetes requires close monitoring and management to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications if not addressed.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent fall increases his risk for venous thromboembolism, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a weight of 86.2 kg, admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma (SDH) following a fall. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 156/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, and fluid balance is stable with a total fluid input of 3,050 mL and output of 292 mL over the past 24 hours.

Echocardiogram results show a mildly dilated left atrium, moderately dilated right atrium, and normal left ventricular systolic function. The patient has borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the differential shows a predominance of neutrophils. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and differential may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of a head injury.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and mildly dilated left atrium may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's head injury and potential bleeding may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, brain edema, or secondary injury.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is stable, but the risk of fluid overload remains, particularly if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and anemia may indicate kidney injury, which could lead to metabolic complications, such as acidosis or electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory results.
2. Consider antibiotics for potential infection, particularly if the patient's white blood cell count and differential remain elevated.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
4. Continue cardiac monitoring and consider echocardiography to assess cardiac function.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider neuroimaging to assess for potential complications.
6. Consider adjusting fluid management to minimize the risk of fluid overload.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic status and consider adjusting electrolyte management as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with peripheral neuropathy, and Afib on Coumadin. He presented to the hospital with SDH and hypertensive urgency following a fall. He was treated with antihypertensives and 3.5L HD, resulting in hypotension.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 71 bpm
* Blood pressure: 156/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Weight: 86.2 kg (admission: 82 kg)
* Height: 64 inches

Physical examination:

* Peripheral vascular: 2+ pulses in all extremities
* Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallop
* Abdomen: soft, non-tender, and obese
* Extremities: WWP, edema in lower extremities, increased edema in RUE
* Neurologic: alert and oriented, moving all 4 extremities

Laboratory results:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 34.9%
* White blood cell count: 10.3 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 261 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 48 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 8.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 59 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 135 mmol/L, K 4.5 mmol/L, Mg 2.3 mmol/L, PO4 6.6 mmol/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he may require further antihypertensive therapy.
2. SDH: The patient's SDH is stable, but he will need to be monitored for any changes or worsening of symptoms.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is being managed with HD, but he may need to be monitored for any changes in his renal function.
4. DM: The patient's DM is being managed with insulin sliding scale, but he may need to be monitored for any changes in his glucose levels.
5. Afib on Coumadin: The patient's Afib is being managed with Coumadin, but he may need to be monitored for any changes in his coagulation status.
6. RUE swelling: The patient's RUE swelling may be due to fluid overload or thrombosis, and he will need to be monitored for any changes or worsening of symptoms.
7. FEN: The patient's FEN is being managed with a low-sodium diet and electrolyte repletion, but he may need to be monitored for any changes in his electrolyte levels.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

1. Continue to monitor his blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive therapy as needed.
2. Monitor his SDH and adjust his therapy accordingly.
3. Continue his ESRD management with HD and monitor his renal function.
4. Manage his DM with insulin sliding scale and monitor his glucose levels.
5. Monitor his Afib and adjust his Coumadin therapy accordingly.
6. Monitor his RUE swelling and adjust his therapy accordingly.
7. Manage his FEN with a low-sodium diet and electrolyte repletion, and monitor his electrolyte levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 85.5 kg male who was converted to atrial fibrillation (a.fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and treated with a 250mL NS bolus. The patient's heart rate was in the 130s-140s beats per minute (bpm). The patient was in a.fib for approximately 2-3 hours before converting back to sinus rhythm (SR) at 1am. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 137/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total output of 4,500mL and a total input of 1,715mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's conversion to a.fib and subsequent treatment with a 250mL NS bolus may have caused cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Dehydration: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and tubes may increase the risk of infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the use of nasal cannula oxygen and the patient's underlying medical condition may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is not fully assessed, but the patient's presence in the ICU and the use of sedatives and paralytics may increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's presence in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and tubes may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. DVT and PE: The patient's immobility and the use of invasive lines and tubes may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's presence in the ICU and the use of sedatives and paralytics may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. VAP: The patient's presence in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and tubes may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient is a 82-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, and type II diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, who presented from the outpatient setting (OSH) with subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency after a fall.
* The patient's blood pressure control is currently being managed with antihypertensives and HD, with a plan to resume home blood pressure medications as needed.
* The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, but given the lack of fever or other signs of infection, sepsis is unlikely.
* The patient's SDH is stable, and he will continue to be monitored for blood pressure and neurological status.
* The patient's ESRD is being managed with HD, and his fluid goal has been adjusted to 1-3L today due to evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray (CXR) and examination.
* The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale, and he will be uptitrated as necessary.
* The patient's atrial fibrillation (Afib) on coumadin is being held due to the recent fall, and he will need to be off anticoagulation for 4 weeks before restarting.
* The patient's right upper extremity (RUE) swelling is being monitored, and a RUQ echo is planned to assess for thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis or stroke due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Infection or sepsis due to the patient's elevated WBC count
* Further neurological decline or worsening of the SDH due to uncontrolled blood pressure or other factors
* Fluid overload or congestive heart failure due to inadequate fluid management
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin sliding scale or other factors
* Thrombosis or CVL complication due to the patient's RUE swelling
* Anticoagulation-related bleeding or stroke due to the patient's Afib on coumadin."

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of ESRD, HTN, DM Type II, peripheral neuropathy, and AFIB, who was admitted to the ICU with a fall, SDH, and hypertensive urgency. He was treated with antihypertensives and HD, resulting in hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had some notable events. He converted to a.fib with RVR and was treated with a bolus of NS. He has been without urination for 2 days since his Foley catheter was removed and is now seemingly anuric. His blood pressure is now under control with metoprolol and diltiazem, and he is being monitored. He has been on HD three times a week and is now being followed by nephrology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular: The patient's history of AFIB and recent conversion to a.fib with RVR may increase his risk of cardiac complications. His blood pressure is now under control, but he may still be at risk for cardiac events.
2. Renal: The patient's anuria and history of ESRD may indicate a high risk of renal complications. His creatinine level is elevated, and he may need further evaluation and treatment.
3. Neurological: The patient's SDH and history of peripheral neuropathy may increase his risk of neurological complications. He is being monitored for any changes in his neurological status.
4. Infection: The patient's history of falls and immobility may increase his risk of infection. He is being monitored for any signs of infection.
5. Metabolic: The patient's history of DM and anuria may increase his risk of metabolic complications. He is being monitored for any changes in his blood glucose levels.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's anuria and history of ESRD may increase his risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. He is being monitored for any changes in his fluid and electrolyte levels.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust his treatment as necessary.
2. Further evaluate the patient's renal function and consider adjusting his HD schedule or medication as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient for any signs of infection and adjust his treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's metabolic status and adjust his treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte levels and adjust his treatment as necessary."

   Was in a.fib for approx 2 to 3 hours.  Converted back to sinus at
   approx 1am.
   Patient reports no urination for 2 days since foley was removed. Says
   he normally urinates at home several times per day.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II with peripheral neuropathy, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) who presented to the hospital with subdural hematoma (SDH) and hypertensive urgency. He has been in the ICU for several days and has developed a few complications.

The patient's 24-hour events include a conversion to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, which was treated with a 250mL NS bolus. He has also developed decreased fluid status, which may have contributed to his abnormal rhythm. The patient reports no urination for 2 days since his Foley catheter was removed, which is concerning given his normal urinary habits.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm and blood pressure of 137/52 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula oxygen. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and conversant male with no signs of distress. His cardiovascular examination is significant for an irregularly irregular rhythm during the first examination, which converted to sinus rhythm during the second examination. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a range of 10.3-26.1 K/uL. His platelet count is 261-188 K/uL, and his hemoglobin is 9.6-4.3 g/dL. His creatinine is 8.5-4.3 mg/dL, and his glucose is 59-187 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Blood pressure control: Metoprolol 25 TID and added home diltiazam 30 TID to monitor.
2. SDH: Stable neurologically, holding coumadin, and continuing Keppra 500 mg PO BID to be dosed after HD on HD days.
3. ESRD: Patient on HD M/W/F, with a recent HD session. He is now seemingly anuric, and a bladder scan is planned to assess for obstruction after Foley removal.
4. DM: Hold oral anti-hyperglycemic, given episode of hypoglycemia. Change to insulin sliding scale for now, and uptitrate as necessary.
5. Afib on Coumadin: Patient with history of AFIB on coumadin. Given recent fall, patient likely not a candidate to continue on coumadin. Discussed with neurosurg regarding anticoagulation in context of SDH. Will need to be off anticoagulation for 4 weeks and then seen in [**Hospital 5054**] clinic to reeval.
6. RUE swelling: Good pulses, low concern for CVL complication. Thrombosis is possible, and a RUQ echo is planned.
7. FEN: Low sodium, diabetic diet, and check and replete lytes to goal K>4, Mg>2.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may require further management.
2. Anuria: The patient's recent HD session and decreased fluid status may have contributed to his anuria. A bladder scan is planned to assess for obstruction after Foley removal.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's recent episode of hypoglycemia may require further management, and a change to insulin sliding scale may be necessary.
4. AFIB: The patient's recent conversion to AFIB with rapid ventricular rate may require further management, and a RUQ echo is planned to assess for thrombosis.
5. SDH: The patient's SDH may require further management, and a discussion with neurosurg regarding anticoagulation is planned.
6. RUE swelling: The patient's RUE swelling may require further management, and a RUQ echo is planned to assess for thrombosis.
7. FEN: The patient's low sodium and diabetic diet may require further management, and a check and repletion of lytes to goal K>4, Mg>2 is planned."
