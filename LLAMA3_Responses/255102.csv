   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in the am to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to ***.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above for fluid resuscitation.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Will recheck EKG in the am and monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss anticoagulation with the team in the am.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was ***
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # PPx: SQH, PPI not indicated.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's kidney function can continue to decline, leading to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to heart failure, stroke, and death.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can worsen, leading to decreased metabolism, fatigue, and decreased cognitive function.

The patient's current medications include:

* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Levophed
* Donepezil
* Memantine
* Risperdone
* Levothyroxine
* Calcium and vitamin D

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 18.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 27.4%
* Platelet count: 377 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 69 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: 104 mg/dL (sodium), 21 mEq/L (potassium), 4.0 mEq/L (chloride), and 137 mEq/L (bicarbonate)

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in the am to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to ***.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above for fluid resuscitation.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Will recheck EKG in the am and monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss anticoagulation with the team in the am.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was ***
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # PPx: SQH, PPI not indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents to the ICU with sepsis, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. She was given IV fluids, levophed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and is being monitored for CVP, MAP, and urine output. She has a central line, and her CVP is ranging from 7-4. She has a 2 cm firm mass in the anterior portion of her mid-neck, which is not causing any respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's CVP is ranging from 7-4, which may indicate septic shock. She is being monitored closely for signs of worsening sepsis, such as decreased urine output, increased lactate levels, and decreased blood pressure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her FENa is 0.2, which suggests a prerenal cause of AKI. She is at risk for further kidney injury due to her hypotension and decreased urine output.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being monitored, and she is at risk for stroke or cardiac arrest if her rate control is not managed effectively.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being monitored, and she is at risk for further blood loss or worsening anemia if her bleeding is not managed effectively.
5. Post-obstructive Pneumonia (PON): The patient's PNA is being managed, and she is at risk for PON if her airway is not managed effectively.
6. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration risk is being assessed, and she is at risk for aspiration if her airway is not managed effectively.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and she is at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygenation and ventilation are not managed effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's CVP, MAP, and urine output closely to assess for signs of worsening sepsis.
2. Continue to manage the patient's AKI with IV fluids, levophed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and manage her rate control effectively to prevent stroke or cardiac arrest.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and manage her bleeding effectively to prevent further blood loss.
5. Continue to manage the patient's PNA and PON with antibiotics and respiratory support as needed.
6. Continue to assess the patient's aspiration risk and manage her airway effectively to prevent aspiration.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and manage her oxygenation and ventilation effectively to prevent respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents from her nursing home with sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg. She is on oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with no ventilator assistance. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a firm mass in the anterior portion of her mid-neck, trachea midline. Her neurological examination is normal, with no evidence of jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.9 K/μL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dL, and creatinine (Cr) of 3.0 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 104 mg/dL, and her serum magnesium level is 2.1 mg/dL. 

The patient's urinary legionella antigen is negative, and her blood cultures are pending. Her urine culture is also pending. 

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), and is being treated for sepsis. She is also receiving norepinephrine to maintain her mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may require further respiratory support if her oxygenation or ventilation becomes compromised.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further monitoring and treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may require further treatment for rate control and anticoagulation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but she may require further monitoring for signs of worsening dementia or other neurological complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is stable, but she may require further monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, and she may require further treatment for sepsis or other infections.
7. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving IV fluids, and she may require further monitoring for signs of fluid overload.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she may require further treatment for hypotension if her blood pressure becomes compromised.

Based on the patient's current status, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure that she receives the appropriate treatment and care."

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin, and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of dementia and is being treated with antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and vasopressors (Levophed). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 103/62 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR and a small right-sided effusion. She is receiving IV fluids and has a central venous catheter (CVL) in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of stroke or thromboembolism, particularly if anticoagulation is not adequate.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress or develop complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances or fluid overload.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia may exacerbate her confusion or agitation, particularly if her medication regimen is not optimized.
7. Vascular Complications: The patient's central venous catheter (CVL) may cause vascular complications such as thrombosis or infection.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure or hypoxemia.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic regimen as necessary based on culture results.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's vasopressor regimen to optimize blood pressure control.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels closely to manage her acute renal failure.
5. Consider obtaining an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and guide management of her atrial fibrillation.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to manage her dementia.
7. Consider obtaining a CT scan to evaluate the patient's pneumonia and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms."

 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Pt currently off of Levophed will continue to monitor fluid status
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn as the patient
   is being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr is currently
   trending down towards baseline from 3.7 to 2.5 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to
   1.3) likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - Will increase beta blocker therapy to 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg
   TID
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents from her nursing home with sepsis, meeting SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia. The likely source of sepsis is pulmonary, given the infiltrates on CXR and slightly positive UA. She has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn) and IV fluids. She has a central line in place and is being monitored for CVP and MAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent PNA, which may indicate aspiration or a postobstructive process. A speech and swallow evaluation is recommended to assess for aspiration, and a chest CT may be considered to evaluate for a postobstructive process.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and she is being closely monitored for CVP and MAP.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is trending down towards baseline, likely due to pre-renal azotemia. IV fluids and renally dosed medications are being used to manage this condition.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which may require rate control medication. However, given her hypotension, it is being held off for now.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low Hct, which may indicate bleeding or chronic disease. Type and screen are being kept, and her Hct is being trended.
6. Dementia: The patient has a history of worsening dementia, and her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone is being continued.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's levothyroxine is being continued.
8. Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection, and her calcium and vitamin D supplements are being continued.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan includes IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed.
* Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose is being monitored and managed as needed.
* Lines: The patient has a 20-gauge central line and a multi-lumen central line in place.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Code status: The patient has a DNR/DNI code status, which has been confirmed with her daughter."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is an 83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as needed to maintain her MAP > 65.   As her
   pressures have been good, can attempt to wean levophed to day.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn as the patient is
   being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.  Will
   check vanc level in evening to dose vanc by level.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED was
   eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3).  FENa was 0.2, supporting
   a prerenal state.  This am it has trended down to 2.5.  Most likely
   differential includes prerenal vs ATN from recent hypotension.  Also to
   consider are other intrarenal causes such as AIN or postrenal
   obstruction.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few back, and
   small leuk.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents with sepsis, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent PNA, and the current infection may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, septic shock, or prolonged hospitalization.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction, septic shock, or death.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib may increase her risk of stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not managed properly, leading to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or death.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, weakness, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed, requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
9. Infection Control: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis may increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors to manage her sepsis and pneumonia. She is also being monitored for atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia. Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 83-year-old female with Alzheimer's disease and hypothyroidism, is currently in the ICU with sepsis and septic shock. She was weaned off pressors and remains on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Her atrial fibrillation (AF) is reasonably rate-controlled, and she is on heparin infusion with plans for long-term anticoagulation to be clarified. She has anemia, which may be dilutional, and is being monitored. Her dementia, including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct, appears to be stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued sepsis and septic shock: The patient's sepsis and septic shock need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke, if not properly managed.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Dementia: The patient's dementia may progress if not properly managed, leading to cognitive decline and behavioral changes.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis and septic shock may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sepsis and septic shock may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
8. Renal failure: The patient's sepsis and septic shock may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's sepsis and septic shock may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's sepsis and septic shock may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, constipation, or nausea and vomiting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Pneumonia, other with septic shock: off pressors, remains on Vanc and Zosyn, off home hypertensives, and will continue to monitor acute on chronic RF from sepsis/ATN.
* Atrial fibrillation: reasonably rate-controlled, remains on heparin infusion, and long-term plans for anticoagulation to be clarified.
* Anemia: could be dilutional, but as pt anticoagulated, will guiac stools.
* Dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct): PTX appears to be decreasing, continue monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Sepsis-related acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Pneumonia-related respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic embolism
* Anemia-related decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Dementia-related increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and malnutrition
* ICU-acquired weakness and muscle wasting
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other ventilator-related complications

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and optimize her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Pt currently off of Levophed will continue to monitor fluid status
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn as the patient
   is being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr is currently
   trending down towards baseline from 3.7 to 2.5 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to
   1.3) likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - F/u UCx
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - Will increase beta blocker therapy to 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg
   TID
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 26.9.
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  Sips, IVF as above, electrolyte repletion prn.
   - When ready to eat, speech and swallow recs from last admission
   included: thin liquids and regular solids with pills whole with puree
   or with thin liquids.
   - Speech and swallow consult for reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.
   # Comm:  Daughter and HCP [**Name (NI) 2052**] [**Name (NI) 4343**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Pt currently off of Levophed will continue to monitor fluid status
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn as the patient
   is being admitted from a nursing home and was hypotensive in the ED.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culuture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr is currently
   trending down towards baseline from 3.7 to 2.5 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to

   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  One set of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with
   her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
   - Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
   - Will increase beta blocker therapy to 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg
   TID
   - TTE to evaluate her heart fucntion.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of

* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 18.1/49.1/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 41/3/0.02, Differential-Neuts 91.8%, Lymph 3.9%, Mono 3.8%, Eos 0.4%, Ca++ 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.6 mg/dL, PO4 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and concerns include:

* Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia. The likely source is pulmonary given the infiltrates seen on CXR.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's Cr is currently trending down towards baseline from 3.7 to 2.5 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal given her FENa of 0.2.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED EKG. She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online records.
* Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's. In the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85. No clinical evidence of bleeding.
* Alzheimer's disease: The patient has a history of chronically worsening dementia.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine.
* Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection and is on calcium and vitamin D.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintain her CVP 8-12.
* Pt currently off of Levophed will continue to monitor fluid status.
* IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr.
* Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
* Follow-up blood and urine cultures; will send sputum culture.
* Trend WBC count fever curve.
* Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now.
* Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern for either aspiration or a postobstructive process. Will obtain a speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration. Consider chest CT for workup of a postobstructive process as an outpatient.
* Continue to monitor on tele for atrial fibrillation.
* Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other medication for rate control.
* Will discuss the risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation with her daughter and hold off starting a heparin gtt for now.
* Increase her ASA to 325 mg daily.
* Will increase beta blocker therapy to 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID.
* TTE to evaluate her heart function.
* Keep an type and screen for anemia.
* Continue to trend for anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and PNA can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
* Acute on chronic renal failure can lead to worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications such as uremic crisis.
* Atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
* Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Alzheimer's disease can lead to worsening cognitive function, behavioral changes, and increased risk of falls and injuries.
* Hypothyroidism can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and decreased cognitive function.
* Hyperparathyroidism can lead to hypercalcemia, kidney stones, and osteoporosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her plan of care accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, however will
   need to balance fluid resuscitation with her respiratory status as she
   is DNI and now requiring a NRB.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Continue increased beta blocker at 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID
   - Continue heparin gtt for anticoagulation per her primary
   cardiologist.  Will discuss starting coumadin for long-term
   anticoagulation.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Given her need for pressors/sepsis and Hct drop will transfuse one
   unit PRBC and check a post transfusion Hct.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration
- Speech and swallow had seen the patient on [**1-25**] and recommended soft solids an

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Continue to monitor CVP and give IVF boluses to maintian her CVP
   8-12.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, however will
   need to balance fluid resuscitation with her respiratory status as she
   is DNI and now requiring a NRB.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrance of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a postobstructive process.  Will obtain a
   speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration.  Consider chest CT for
   workup of a posobstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Given her hypotension and as her rate is in the 80's to 90's
   currently will hold off starting a nodal blocker or other [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   rate control.
   - Continue increased beta blocker at 25mg Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID
   - Continue heparin gtt for anticoagulation per her primary
   cardiologist.  Will discuss starting coumadin for long-term
   anticoagulation.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.
   - Given her need for pressors/sepsis and Hct drop will transfuse one
   unit PRBC and check a post transfusion Hct.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Continue her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   - Continue Ca and Vit D
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration
- Speech and swallow had seen the patient on [**1-25**] and recommended soft solids an
d nectral thick liquids.  Will need reevaluation.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She presents to the ICU with sepsis, PNA, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a fever of 101.2°F, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Her blood cultures are pending, and her sputum culture is contaminated. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in a.fib. She is also anemic and has a history of chronic worsening dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and she may require further antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
2. PNA: The patient's PNA is likely to worsen, and she may require further treatment, including bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely to worsen, and she may require further dialysis or hemofiltration.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to continue, and she may require further anticoagulation and rate control medication.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen, and she may require further transfusions and iron supplementation.
6. Aspiration: The patient's recent aspiration event is a risk factor for further aspiration, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Postobstructive Process: The patient's recent PNA and aspiration event may have caused a postobstructive process, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen, and she may require further oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
10. Infection: The patient's sepsis and PNA may increase her risk of infection, and she may require further antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Continue to provide antibiotics and antifungal therapy as needed.
3. Continue to provide fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid and electrolyte replacement accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her anticoagulation and rate control medication accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusion and iron supplementation accordingly.
7. Continue to evaluate the patient's aspiration risk and provide further treatment as needed.
8. Continue to evaluate the patient's postobstructive process and provide further treatment as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and provide further oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular function and provide further treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - NPO given recurrent aspiration.  Will have meeting with her daughter
   to discuss goals of care and possible placement of a feeding tube.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Hold her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone for now
   as NPO.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Stopping Ca and Vit D for now given aspiration risk.
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration. Family meeting as above to dicuss
   goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for sepsis and PNA.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on non-rebreather mask
* Heart rhythm: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Elderly female lying in bed in no apparent distress
* Scattered crackles in the lungs
* Soft, tender abdomen
* Trace edema in both legs
* Neurological examination shows normal cranial nerves II and XII, and normal strength in all four extremities

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 18.9 K/μL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 22.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 459 K/μL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 14.6 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the emergency department (ED). The likely source is pulmonary given the infiltrates seen on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient was given additional intravenous fluids (IVF) and started on levophed for low mean arterial pressure (MAP).
* Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hb in the low to mid 30's. In the ED, her Hb was 28.6 g/dL, and her mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 85. No clinical evidence of bleeding.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine has decreased to 1.6 mg/dL from 3.7 mg/dL on admission. The patient's FENa is 0.1, indicating pre-renal azotemia.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation (a.fib) on her ED electrocardiogram (EKG). She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online records.
* Alzheimer's disease: The patient has a history of chronically worsening dementia.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently taking levothyroxine, which will be changed to intravenous (IV) due to her aspiration risk.
* Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is status post-parathyroid resection and is currently taking calcium and vitamin D, which will be stopped due to her aspiration risk.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration and has recently aspirated during lunch, which has led to a decrease in her oxygen saturation.
* Sepsis: The patient has sepsis and PNA, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and death.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine has decreased, but she is still at risk for acute kidney injury due to her pre-renal azotemia and chronic kidney disease.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in a.fib, which can lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is recommended to:

* Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status.
* Continue to provide broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for PNA and sepsis.
* Monitor the patient's creatinine and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
* Consider a chest computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out post-obstructive process.
* Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if necessary.
* Consider a feeding tube placement if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake.
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hyperparathyroidism and consider stopping calcium and vitamin D if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with Alzheimer's dementia, admitted with pneumonia and sepsis. She has developed aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, pressors, and antibiotics. Her vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 101.2°F, hypotension, and tachycardia. Her respiratory status is compromised, with hypoxic episodes and a SpO2 of 100%. She has a history of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not improving, and there is a risk of multi-organ failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not resolving, and there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is not improving, and there is a risk of chronic kidney disease progression.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not controlled, and there is a risk of stroke or cardiac arrest.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is not improving, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest or organ failure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is not improving, and there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
7. Infection: The patient has multiple bacteremia, which may lead to septicemia and organ failure.
8. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status may lead to malnutrition and further compromise her already compromised immune system.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and compromised circulation may lead to pressure ulcers, which can further complicate her care.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - NPO given recurrent aspiration.  Will have meeting with her daughter
   to discuss goals of care and possible placement of a feeding tube.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - Continue levophed as need to maintain MAP > 65.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures.  Sputum cx contaminated, should send
   another.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  This am her Hct was 22.7( from 25.5)
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.6
   (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely pre-renal
   given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Hold her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone for now
   as NPO.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Stopping Ca and Vit D for now given aspiration risk.
   # FEN:  NPO given recent aspiration. Family meeting as above to dicuss
   goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and pneumonia, and has been experiencing recurrent aspiration, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. She has been treated with antibiotics, pressors, and oxygen therapy. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. She has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has a history of chronic worsening dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may not be fully treated, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
3. Aspiration: The patient's recurrent aspiration may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to increased risk of mortality.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to increased risk of stroke and mortality.
7. Chronic Worsening Dementia: The patient's chronic worsening dementia may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to increased risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis and pneumonia with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust pressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider placing a feeding tube to prevent further aspiration.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize the patient's anticoagulation therapy.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's kidney function.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's dementia and adjust treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Nectar thickened liquids per S&S but awaiting video swallow study
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx.  Blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC
   in pairs/chains
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely
   pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Were holding her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone
   while NPO but should restart.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Nectar thickened diet. Family meeting as above to dicuss goals
   of care and possible feeding tube placement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Nectar thickened liquids per S&S but awaiting video swallow study
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx.  Blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC
   in pairs/chains
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely
   pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Were holding her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone
   while NPO but should restart.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Nectar thickened diet. Family meeting as above to dicuss goals
   of care and possible feeding tube placement.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and PNA, and has been treated with antibiotics, pressors, and IV fluids. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/44 mmHg. She has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 98%. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may continue to worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's PNA may recur or spread to other parts of the lung, leading to respiratory failure and increased mortality.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to stroke or thromboembolism if not properly managed with anticoagulation therapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed with blood transfusions and iron supplements.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may lead to further worsening of her kidney function and increased risk of complications such as sepsis and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Hyperparathyroidism: The patient's hyperparathyroidism may lead to further complications such as bone disease and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen if not properly managed with medications and supportive care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and PNA with antibiotics, pressors, and IV fluids.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation closely and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Manage the patient's anemia with blood transfusions and iron supplements.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Manage the patient's hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement therapy and calcium and vitamin D supplements, respectively.
6. Provide supportive care for the patient's dementia, including medications and psychological support.
7. Consider a feeding tube placement if the patient's nutritional needs cannot be met with nectar-thickened diet.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely and adjust therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with history of dementia now admitted with likely
   aspiration penumonitis and persistent altered mental status with
   hemodynamics affected by both SIRS and Atrial Fibrillation showing some
   improvement in the setting of signifcant elevation in CVP.
   1)PNEUMONIA, Aspiration
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Video Swallow suggested and will pursue today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Heparin started after discussion with outpatient cardiologist
but now
   with patient showing OB+ stool and decreased HCT concern raised in the
   setting of significant fall risk to hold anticoagulation
   -Continue with rate control
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   -Will need PO intake to allow administration of medications.
 Sepsis
charcaterized as HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Only with improved
   volume have we been able to wean pressors to off.
   -Continue with Negative fluid balance as possible
   -Likley aspiration pneumonia and do have to raise concern for possible
   C. diff in the picture here
   -Will continue ABX and follow up single culture in the setting of
   clinical improvement it may well represent contaminant rather than true
   pathogen.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Continued oliguria but without significant change
   in Cr as of yet
   -Continue to maintain euvolemia
   -Renal dose meds going forward
   -Will trial diuresis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with history of dementia now admitted with likely
   aspiration penumonitis and persistent altered mental status with
   hemodynamics affected by both SIRS and Atrial Fibrillation showing some
   improvement in the setting of signifcant elevation in CVP.
   1)PNEUMONIA, Aspiration
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Video Swallow suggested and will pursue today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Heparin started after discussion with outpatient cardiologist
but now
   with patient showing OB+ stool and decreased HCT concern raised in the
   setting of significant fall risk to hold anticoagulation
   -Continue with rate control
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   -Will need PO intake to allow administration of medications.
 Sepsis
charcaterized as HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Only with improved
   volume have we been able to wean pressors to off.
   -Continue with Negative fluid balance as possible
   -Likley aspiration pneumonia and do have to raise concern for possible
   C. diff in the picture here
   -Will continue ABX and follow up single culture in the setting of
   clinical improvement it may well represent contaminant rather than true
   pathogen.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Continued oliguria but without significant change
   in Cr as of yet
   -Continue to maintain euvolemia
   -Renal dose meds going forward
   -Will trial diuresis

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Nectar thickened liquids per S&S but awaiting video swallow study
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx.  Blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC
   in pairs/chains
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely
   pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Were holding her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone
   while NPO but should restart.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Nectar thickened diet. Family meeting as above to dicuss goals
   of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.
   Yesterday was seen to aspirate during lunch and later became
   hypotenisve to the 80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on
   her SBP so levophed was restarted.
   - Nectar thickened liquids per S&S but awaiting video swallow study
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx.  Blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC
   in pairs/chains
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.
   - Keep an type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for Hct
   < 21.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3) likely
   pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Hold beta blocker given hypotension and pressor requirement.
   - DC heparin gtt given her Hct drop.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Were holding her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone
   while NPO but should restart.
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine, will change to IV.
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Nectar thickened diet. Family meeting as above to dicuss goals
   of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia (PNA) who presents from her nursing home with sepsis.

The patient has been experiencing the following conditions:

1. Sepsis/PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the ED. The likely source is pulmonary given the infiltrates seen on CXR. She was given additional IVF and started on levophed for low MAPs.
2. Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's. Her Hct is now 22-24, but appears to be stable.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's Cr decreased to 1.1 from 1.6, likely pre-renal given her FENa of 0.2.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED EKG. She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online records.
5. Alzheimer's Disease: The patient has a history of chronically worsening dementia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been dropping, and she is DNI.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, stroke, or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's sepsis may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's DNI status and potential need for a feeding tube may lead to nutritional complications.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and pressor requirement may lead to further hemodynamic instability.

The patient's medications include:

1. Vancomycin
2. Zosyn

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving but low grade fevers overnight
   concerning for repeat aspiration vs bacteremia (unlikely)
   - On nectar thickened liquids per S&S but consider making NPO pending
   video swallow study
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with keukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for
   Hct < 21.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically

   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving but low grade fevers overnight
   concerning for repeat aspiration vs bacteremia (unlikely)
   - On nectar thickened liquids per S&S but consider making NPO pending
   video swallow study
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with keukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for
   Hct < 21.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Restarted home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone while
   NPO
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Was on nectar thickened diet but NPO for now. Family meeting as
   above to discuss goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. She has a history of chronic worsening dementia and is currently NPO pending a video swallow study. Her blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has had episodes of hypotension and low-grade fevers. She is at risk for aspiration and has had two episodes of small, black, guaiac-positive stools.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to her dementia, pneumonia, and recent aspiration episode. She may require further intervention, such as a feeding tube, to prevent further aspiration.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has had episodes of low-grade fevers, which may indicate bacteremia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to be a complication of her sepsis, and she may require further treatment, such as antibiotics or mechanical ventilation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to be a complication of her sepsis and may require further treatment, such as anticoagulation or rate control medication.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to be a complication of her chronic kidney disease and may require further treatment, such as transfusions or erythropoietin.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease is likely to be a complication of her hypertension and may require further treatment, such as dialysis or medication.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and sepsis may lead to cardiac arrest, which may require CPR and defibrillation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Consider further intervention, such as a feeding tube, to prevent further aspiration.
4. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures for signs of bacteremia.
5. Consider further treatment for atrial fibrillation, such as anticoagulation or rate control medication.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and chronic kidney disease, and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider further treatment for pneumonia, such as mechanical ventilation or antibiotics.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female admitted with sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and a history of Alzheimer's dementia. She has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Her blood cultures have been positive, and she has been receiving antibiotics. She is currently receiving ICU care, including oxygen therapy, and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and impaired skin integrity. Her medical history includes dementia, and she is receiving treatment with Namenda and Aricept.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to be complicated by her atrial fibrillation, which can increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. She may also be at risk for further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and decreased cardiac output. She may also be at risk for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death. She may also be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as bronchopneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further skin breakdown, infection, and sepsis. She may also be at risk for pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may lead to further cognitive decline, agitation, and aggression. She may also be at risk for falls, malnutrition, and dehydration.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure. She may also be at risk for further complications, such as shock or cardiac arrest.
7. Infections: The patient's infections may lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death. She may also be at risk for further complications, such as abscesses or osteomyelitis.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may lead to death or further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac failure.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to death or further respiratory complications, such as ARDS or chronic respiratory failure.
10. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological complications may lead to further cognitive decline, seizures, or stroke. She may also be at risk for further complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving, though she was called out on [**1-29**]
   but was hypoxic on arrival.  Resolved spontaneously and is now satting
   well on 4L.
   - On nectar thickened liquids; family understands her risk of
   aspiration but agree that he is not to return to ICU if she becomes
   hypoxic.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Consider coverage for Linezolid given single blood cx growing VRE on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving, though she was called out on [**1-29**]
   but was hypoxic on arrival.  Resolved spontaneously and is now satting
   well on 4L.
   - On nectar thickened liquids; family understands her risk of
   aspiration but agree that he is not to return to ICU if she becomes
   hypoxic.
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Consider coverage for Linezolid given single blood cx growing VRE on
   [**1-26**] if patient spikes or clinically worsens; also pull left subclavian
   once PICC placed
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE

   - Send q3d type and screen.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She presents to the ICU with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia. She has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been started on levophed for low blood pressure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. She has a history of aspiration and was found to have intermittent trace to mild penetration and aspiration on a video swallow study. She is currently on nectar-thickened liquids and soft-pureed solids.
* Cardiovascular: She has atrial fibrillation and has been started on heparin for anticoagulation. Her blood pressure has stabilized, but she has been hypotensive in the past.
* Hematological: She has anemia, with a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's. Her Hct has decreased to 22-24, but appears to be stable.
* Renal: She has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.1. She has been treated with IV fluids and has been advised to trend her creatinine level.
* Neurological: She has a history of Alzheimer's disease and has been restarted on her home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone.
* Infectious disease: She has sepsis, likely due to pneumonia. She has been treated with antibiotics and has had a single blood culture growing VRE. She has also had a sputum culture and blood culture that are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of aspiration and current respiratory status make her at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of hypertension make her at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and history of hypertension make her at risk for worsening renal function.
* Infection: The patient's sepsis and history of pneumonia make her at risk for developing further infections.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding make her at risk for further bleeding complications.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's history of Alzheimer's disease and current neurological status make her at risk for further neurological deterioration.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her family has been informed of her condition and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old female with a history of Alzhiemer's dementia,
   hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for PNA who presents
   from her nursing home with sepsis.
   # Pneumonia:  The patient met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis and
   tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is pulmonary given the
   infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a slightly positive UA.  Overnight
   a central line was placed and her CVP was found to range from [**7-4**].
   She was given additional IVF and then started on levophed for low MAPs
   even with CVP of [**8-4**].  Urinary legionella returned negative.  Was seen
   to aspirate during lunch on [**1-27**] and later became hypotenisve to the
   80
s with decreased UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed
   was restarted.  One blood cx from [**1-26**] growing GPC in pairs/chains.
   Clinically appears to be improving but low grade fevers overnight
   concerning for repeat aspiration vs bacteremia (unlikely)
   - On nectar thickened liquids per S&S but consider making NPO pending
   video swallow study
   - Continue broad-spectrum coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Follow-up blood cultures, sputum cx., blood cx.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - Hold outpatient antihypertensives for now (Hctz and lisinopril).
   - Given her reoccurrence of PNA in the RLL again, this raises concern
   for either aspiration or a post obstructive process.  Consider chest CT
   for workup of a post obstructive process as an outpatient.
   # Sepsis:  Initially met SIRS criteria with keukocytosis and
   tachycardia in ED.  Source of infection is pneumonia.  Blood pressure
   has stabilized.
   - Continue to monitor CVP to maintain her CVP 8-12.  Will be very
   cautious in giving IVF as her oxygen sats have been dropping and she is
   DNI.
   - No longer on levophed.
   # Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on her ED
   EKG.  She does not appear to have a history of a.fib per online
   records.  Last TTE in '[**55**] showed normal systolic function, mild pulm
   art systolic htn, and slightly dilated right atrium.  Two sets of CE
   were negative, TSH normal at 2.2.  Her outpatient cardiologist decided
   to start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  TTE showed. Right
   ventricular dilation with normal function. Preserved left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.  CHADS score of 2.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Have restarted low dose metoprolol for rate control
   - No longer on heparin gtt or aspirin given her Hct drop.
   # Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In
   the ED her Hct was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  No clinical evidence of
   bleeding.  Hct now 22-24 but appears to be stable.  Still having guaiac
   positive stools, however.
   - Send q3d type and screen.  Will recheck a pm Hct and transfuse for
   Hct < 21.
   - bleeding is of unclear etiology and ddx includes neoplasm, AVMs,
   ulcers, gastritis.  Colonoscopy as outpatient provided Hct remains
   stable.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Resolving, now Cr decreased to 1.1
   on [**1-28**] from 1.6 (had been 3.7 on admission (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3)
   likely pre-renal given her  FENa of 0.2.   More recent FENa 0.1.
   - IVF as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Alzheimer's Disease:  The patient has a history of chronically
   worsening dementia.
   - Restarted home regimen of donepezil, memantine, and risperdone while
   NPO
   - Risperdone prn for agitation.
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
   Continue Ca and Vit D since no longer NPO.
   # FEN:  Was on nectar thickened diet but NPO for now. Family meeting as
   above to discuss goals of care and possible feeding tube placement.
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with her daughter on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   presents from her nursing home with sepsis.
   24 Hour Events:
   -Called out to floor and returned for desaturation on 4L; was 90% on
   100% shovel mask, basically resumed status quo after return w/
   improvement of O2 sat to 90s on 4L
   -Had video swallow that showed intermittent trace to mild penetration
   and aspiration with thin and nectar thick liquids recommended thin
   liquids and soft-pureed solids with 1:1 sitter if HCP accepts risks of
   aspiration
   - NPO for moment and HCP coming in tomorrow

   83 yo female with admission with h/o dementia now with likely pneumonia
   and course compliacted by atrial fibrilllation and intermittent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia and altered mental status. She has a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and is currently being treated for pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypoxemia, which has been attributed to possible recurrent aspiration events. However, no witnessed events were reported yesterday to explain the hypoxemia. The patient's lung fields show increased opacity in the right lung field, which may be due to hydrostatic edema and/or pneumonitis.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is being monitored for fevers or return of positive cultures. She is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with rate control as needed.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, and the plan is to continue antibiotic therapy and monitor for fevers or return of positive cultures. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is to be transferred to the floor from the ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent hypoxemia and pneumonia increase her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and antibiotic therapy increase her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible tachycardia increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases her risk of developing a wound infection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential need for supervised feeds increase her risk of malnutrition.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."
