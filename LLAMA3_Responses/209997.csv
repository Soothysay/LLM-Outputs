You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis following ERCP stent placement. He is currently septic, intubated, and awaiting percutaneous cholecystostomy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/71 mmHg. He is receiving IV fluids and has received a total of 3 liters of normal saline over the past 3 hours. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung examination and soft, non-tender abdomen. He has no edema or calf pain, and his neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, indicating acute kidney injury. His liver function tests are elevated, and he has a prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis secondary to cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, and acute kidney injury. He is being treated with IV antibiotics, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is planned for decompression of the gallbladder. He is also being considered for an IR bedside cholecystostomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to further sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia indicate cardiovascular instability, which can worsen if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of his cholangitis and acute cholecystitis.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cholecystitis and cholangitis may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL, is admitted to the ICU with choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis. He has had episodes of hypotension that are fluid responsive. The plan is for percutaneous cholecystostomy tube for decompression of the gallbladder. The patient is currently receiving IV Zosyn, IV fluids, and FFP and Vit K due to an elevated INR. He is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/71 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 25 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for bibasilar crackles on lung examination.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis increase his risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's hypotensive episodes and potential pre-renal ARF increase his risk of developing AKI, which could require dialysis and impact his overall prognosis.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated INR and receipt of FFP and Vit K increase his risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures such as ERCP.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's bibasilar crackles on lung examination suggest possible pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and HTN increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction, particularly in the setting of stress and hypotension.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA increases his risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure, particularly in the setting of hypotension and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp.  Plan is for percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube for decompression of gallbladder. Briefly on neo
   post/op but weaned off with good MAPs.
   - A- line to monitor for MAPs > 65 levophed/vasopressin if needed
   - Central line placement today
   - Monitor CVP; IVFs to maintain CVP > [**11-10**], and give
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - Plan for IR bedside cholecystostomy to decompress inflamed
   gallbladder
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient can likely be weaned from vent once patient
   is acutely stabilized hemodynamically.
   - Attempt to wean from vent later today
   - Send sputum cultures as patient has increased secretions
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as
   has decreased uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - IVF
s prn
   - Consider urine lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis.
   - continue zosyn
   - IR placement of cholecystomy drain today to decompress gall bladder
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA
   - obtain baseline ECG
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold home meds in the setting of transient hypotension in ED
   - BB

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis following ERCP stent placement. He is currently septic, intubated, and awaiting percutaneous cholecystostomy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/59 mmHg. His respiratory support is via a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 520 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 24.6 and a C-reactive protein level of 162 IU/L. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). He is also taking medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hypercholesterolemia.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis following ERCP.
2. Acute cholecystitis: Complicated by the presence of pus in the common bile duct.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Unclear baseline, but likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension.
4. Respiratory failure: Secondary to sepsis and respiratory distress.
5. Cardiovascular instability: Secondary to sepsis and hypotension.
6. Neurological complications: Secondary to sepsis and potential cerebral edema.
7. Hemorrhagic complications: Secondary to the risk of bleeding from the ERCP procedure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to decompress the gallbladder.
2. Empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of possible pneumonia.
3. IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of possible PNA.
4. Monitoring of CVP and IVF to maintain CVP > 11 mmHg.
5. Attempt to wean from the ventilator later today.
6. Send sputum cultures as the patient has increased secretions.
7. Consider urine lytes and renally dose medications.
8. Monitor uop and BUN/Cr levels.

The patient's family has been informed of his condition and code status, and will be updated on his progress."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now when he can take po meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male who was admitted with choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis following an ERCP procedure. He developed sepsis and was intubated, but has since been weaned off ventilatory support and extubated. The patient has a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL, and is currently receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and is draining brown fluid. The patient's laboratory results show a mixed infection with Enterococcus species, and he is being treated with empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has been complicated by the development of acute cholecystitis and cholangitis, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.4 to 1.1, suggesting that he may be at risk for AKI, particularly given his history of CAD and HTN.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation has improved since being extubated, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure if his lung function deteriorates.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and HTN places him at increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's mixed infection with Enterococcus species may lead to further complications, including bacteremia and septic shock.
6. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis may lead to further complications, including pancreatitis and liver abscesses.
7. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis may lead to further complications, including perforation and peritonitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam pending further culture data from the percutaneous cholecystomy tube.
2. Repeat blood cultures and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Continue IV fluid resuscitation and monitor for signs of volume overload.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygenation and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Discuss the patient's cardiovascular risk factors with the surgical team and consider adjusting his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Consider restarting simvastatin when the patient is taking oral medications.
8. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust his insulin therapy as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
10. Consider transferring the patient back to the VA for further management if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp.  Plan is for percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube for decompression of gallbladder. Briefly on neo
   post/op but weaned off with good MAPs.
   - A- line to monitor for MAPs > 65 levophed/vasopressin if needed
   - Central line placement today
   - Monitor CVP; IVFs to maintain CVP > [**11-10**], and give
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - Plan for IR bedside cholecystostomy to decompress inflamed
   gallbladder
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient can likely be weaned from vent once patient
   is acutely stabilized hemodynamically.
   - Attempt to wean from vent later today
   - Send sputum cultures as patient has increased secretions
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as
   has decreased uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - Consider urine lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis.
   - continue zosyn
   - IR placement of cholecystomy drain today to decompress gall bladder
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now that he can take po meds
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, pending surgery/ERCP recs and how well he does

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp.  Plan is for percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube for decompression of gallbladder. Briefly on neo
   post/op but weaned off with good MAPs.
   - A- line to monitor for MAPs > 65 levophed/vasopressin if needed
   - Central line placement today
   - Monitor CVP; IVFs to maintain CVP > [**11-10**], and give
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - Plan for IR bedside cholecystostomy to decompress inflamed
   gallbladder
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient can likely be weaned from vent once patient
   is acutely stabilized hemodynamically.
   - Attempt to wean from vent later today
   - Send sputum cultures as patient has increased secretions
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as
   has decreased uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - Consider urine lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis.
   - continue zosyn
   - IR placement of cholecystomy drain today to decompress gall bladder
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now that he can take po meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL. He underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy, which resulted in frank pus in the bile duct. He was intubated and had a central line placed. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, and his condition has been stabilized.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, with a PSV of 10 cmH2O and a FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaO2 of 268, and PaCO2 of 41.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. He has a central line in place for monitoring and management.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 35 mg/dL. He has received over 8 L of IV fluids, and his urine output has been increasing.
* Infectious: The patient has sepsis secondary to cholangitis, and he is being treated with antibiotics. He has a cholecystostomy tube in place to decompress his gallbladder.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological examination is normal, with preserved sensation and strength throughout.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cholecystitis and cholangitis, with large amounts of pus in the bile duct. He has a cholecystostomy tube in place to decompress his gallbladder.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if his infection is not adequately treated.
* ARF: The patient's AKI may progress if his kidney function does not improve.
* Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis may worsen if his bile duct is not adequately decompressed.
* CVA/CAD/PVD: The patient's pre-existing cardiovascular conditions may worsen if he experiences further complications.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if his blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
* COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen if his respiratory status deteriorates.
* BPH: The patient's BPH may worsen if his urinary tract is not adequately managed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics to treat his sepsis and cholangitis
* Monitoring his renal function and adjusting his fluid management accordingly
* Managing his blood pressure and cardiovascular status
* Monitoring his respiratory status and adjusting his ventilator settings as needed
* Managing his gastrointestinal symptoms and adjusting his cholecystostomy tube as needed
* Monitoring his neurological status and adjusting his sedation and analgesia as needed
* Continuing his home medications, including simvastatin and inhalers, as tolerated
* Restarting his home regimen of medications for BPH once he is able to take oral medications."

   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function

   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now that he can take po meds

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of CVA, CAD, HTN, and HL, admitted with choledocholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placement, currently septic, intubated, and with acute cholecystitis. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement for decompression of the gallbladder. The patient has been aggressively fluid-resuscitated since admission, receiving over 8L of IVF, and has been on empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of possible PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is secondary to cholangitis s/p ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and empiric coverage with vancomycin are necessary to manage the infection.
2. Acute Cholecystitis: The patient has acute cholecystitis, which may require surgical intervention. The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement has been draining brown fluid since its placement.
3. ARF: The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today, suggesting pre-renal failure. The patient received over 8L of IVF, which may have contributed to his fluid overload.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation and adjusting ventilator settings are necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and he has required aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate blood pressure.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CVA, CAD, and PVD, which may increase his risk of cardiac complications. Monitoring his cardiac function and adjusting his medications as necessary are crucial.
7. Infection: The patient has had multiple attempts at arterial line placement, which may have increased his risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting his antibiotic coverage as necessary are essential.
8. Nutritional Complications: The patient is NPO pending surgery/ERCP recs and post-extubation status. Ensuring adequate nutrition and monitoring for signs of malnutrition are necessary.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to manage his sepsis, acute cholecystitis, and ARF. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and empiric coverage with vancomycin are necessary to manage his infection. The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring and adjustments to his ventilator settings as necessary. His cardiac function and nutritional status also require close monitoring."

   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop

   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now when he can take po meds
   Nutrition: NPO for now, pending surgery/ERCP recs and how well he does

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which can lead to sepsis. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the culture results are pending.
2. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which may be pre-renal in origin due to hypotension and decreased urine output. The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.4 to 1.1, which may indicate improvement, but close monitoring is necessary.
3. Cholecystitis/cholangitis: The patient has a percutaneous cholecystomy tube in place, which has been draining brown fluid. The patient's gallbladder wall thickness and pericholecystic fluid are increased, suggesting ongoing infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated and weaned off mechanical ventilation, but the patient's oxygenation improved significantly after Lasix administration. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and the patient is currently normotensive. However, the patient's home anti-hypertensive medications are being held, and the patient may require re-initiation of therapy.
6. Bradycardia: The patient is bradycardic, which may be related to beta-blocker therapy and sedation. The patient's sedation is being weaned, and the patient's heart rate is improving.
7. Volume overload: The patient received over 8L of IV fluids, which may have contributed to volume overload. The patient's urine output improved after Lasix administration, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent volume overload.
8. Infection: The patient has multiple risk factors for infection, including sepsis, cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis. Close monitoring of infection markers and culture results is necessary.
9. Cardiac function: The patient has a history of CVA, CAD, and PVD, which may affect cardiac function. The patient's cardiac function is being closely monitored, and the patient's ASA status is being discussed with the surgical team.
10. Nutritional status: The patient is currently NPO, pending surgery/ERCP recs and post-extubation status. Close monitoring of nutritional status is necessary to prevent malnutrition.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of possible PNA
* Repeat blood cultures today
* Follow up culture speciation
* FFP prn for any procedures
* Monitor uop
* Renally dose medications
* Continue IV zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
* Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
* Restart simvastatin when taking PO meds
* Continue home inhalers
* Restart home regimen now when patient can take PO meds
* Monitor glycemic control
* Monitor for signs of infection and sepsis
* Close monitoring of cardiac function and ASA status
* Close monitoring of nutritional status"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree
   substantially with the team
s note, including the assessment and plan.
   I would emphasize and add the following points:
   84 y/o gentleman transferred from WRX VA with RUQ pain and concern of
   choledolcholithiasis.  Was having RUQ pain on and off since late
   [**Month (only) 435**], and admitted for rigors, nausea, vomiting but negative work-up
   for cholecystitis beofre being sent home a month ago.  Recently found
   to have cholilithiasis. [**11-19**] had abdominal pain with nausea,
   chills/rigors.  He went to [**Hospital **] hospital [**11-21**], had elevated
   transaminases and a biliburin of 4.7, U/S c/w acute cholecystitis.
   Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care. [**11-22**] was intubated
   pre-ERCP. Procedure required incision at papilla due to inability to
   pass wire past obstructing stone. Stent was placed and pus drained.
   Post ERCP was hypotensive, now requiring neo.
   PMH reviewed: Hx of CVA ?TIAs, CAD s/p MI w stents, AS s/p porcine
   valve repair, PVD, HTN, BPH, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, colon
   polyps, diverticulitis, h/o UGI bleed, psoriasis, ED, left CEA
   Yesterday had successful ERCP and perc cholecystomy drain placed
   yesterday. Pus drained from CBD. Remained intubated overnight for
   respiratory failure but extubated this AM. Had reflex bradycardia
   30s-60s. Given dose of lasix this AM. Now on 3 L o2.  I/o +7.5  L,
   since midnight, neg 1L
   On exam, 135/71, HR 67, alert, HOH, lungs with exp wheezes, S1S2 reg,
   abd soft, mild RUQ tenderness, no rebound or guarding, pigtail in
   place.  Labs reviewed
 wbc 12.7 (down from 28). Micro notable for
   enterococcus in blood, also GPC in fluid [**11-22**].
   Impression
   Sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/-
   cholecystitis. Had successful ERCP and perc chole drain yesterday. Will
   discuss with surgery re: their plans and possibility to transfer back
   to VA. Will continue Zosyn for GI coverage at least [**1-31**] more days but
   will need at least 14 day course of amp or vanc for enterococcus
   coverage. C/w Vanco for now. His renal insufficiency appears resolved,
   was volume related. Code status will need to be readdressed. Was DNR
   prior to procedure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with a diagnosis of sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/- cholecystitis. He has a history of chronic medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was previously intubated and underwent an ERCP procedure, which required incision at the papilla due to an obstructing stone. A stent was placed, and pus was drained from the common bile duct. He was extubated this morning and is currently receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, and blood pressure of 171/77 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97%. He has mild RUQ tenderness and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to progress if not adequately treated with antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient's enterococcal bacteremia may lead to further complications, such as endocarditis, meningitis, or abscesses, if not properly treated with antibiotics.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis may lead to further complications, such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or liver abscesses, if not properly treated with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and current sepsis may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may worsen if not properly managed with fluid management and diuretics.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and nausea, may worsen if not properly managed with antibiotics and supportive care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and supportive care for sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis progression or complications.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a surgical service for further management of his cholangitis and potential cholecystitis.
4. Continue oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as necessary to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider cardiology consultation if necessary.
6. Continue fluid management and diuretics to manage the patient's renal insufficiency.
7. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms with antibiotics and supportive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree
   substantially with the team
s note, including the assessment and plan.
   I would emphasize and add the following points:
   84 y/o gentleman transferred from WRX VA with RUQ pain and concern of
   choledolcholithiasis.  Was having RUQ pain on and off since late
   [**Month (only) 435**], and admitted for rigors, nausea, vomiting but negative work-up
   for cholecystitis beofre being sent home a month ago.  Recently found
   to have cholilithiasis. [**11-19**] had abdominal pain with nausea,
   chills/rigors.  He went to [**Hospital **] hospital [**11-21**], had elevated
   transaminases and a biliburin of 4.7, U/S c/w acute cholecystitis.
   Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care. [**11-22**] was intubated
   pre-ERCP. Procedure required incision at papilla due to inability to
   pass wire past obstructing stone. Stent was placed and pus drained.
   Post ERCP was hypotensive, now requiring neo.
   PMH reviewed: Hx of CVA ?TIAs, CAD s/p MI w stents, AS s/p porcine
   valve repair, PVD, HTN, BPH, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, colon
   polyps, diverticulitis, h/o UGI bleed, psoriasis, ED, left CEA
   Yesterday had successful ERCP and perc cholecystomy drain placed
   yesterday. Pus drained from CBD. Remained intubated overnight for
   respiratory failure but extubated this AM. Had reflex bradycardia
   30s-60s. Given dose of lasix this AM. Now on 3 L o2.  I/o +7.5  L,
   since midnight, neg 1L
   On exam, 135/71, HR 67, alert, HOH, lungs with exp wheezes, S1S2 reg,
   abd soft, mild RUQ tenderness, no rebound or guarding, pigtail in
   place.  Labs reviewed
 wbc 12.7 (down from 28). Micro notable for
   enterococcus in blood, also GPC in fluid [**11-22**].
   Impression
   Sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/-
   cholecystitis. Had successful ERCP and perc chole drain yesterday. Will
   discuss with surgery re: their plans and possibility to transfer back
   to VA. Will continue Zosyn for GI coverage at least [**1-31**] more days but
   will need at least 14 day course of amp or vanc for enterococcus
   coverage. C/w Vanco for now. His renal insufficiency appears resolved,
   was volume related. Code status will need to be readdressed. Was DNR
   prior to procedure.
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now when he can take po meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree
   substantially with the team
s note, including the assessment and plan.
   I would emphasize and add the following points:
   84 y/o gentleman transferred from WRX VA with RUQ pain and concern of
   choledolcholithiasis.  Was having RUQ pain on and off since late
   [**Month (only) 435**], and admitted for rigors, nausea, vomiting but negative work-up
   for cholecystitis beofre being sent home a month ago.  Recently found
   to have cholilithiasis. [**11-19**] had abdominal pain with nausea,
   chills/rigors.  He went to [**Hospital **] hospital [**11-21**], had elevated
   transaminases and a biliburin of 4.7, U/S c/w acute cholecystitis.
   Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care. [**11-22**] was intubated
   pre-ERCP. Procedure required incision at papilla due to inability to
   pass wire past obstructing stone. Stent was placed and pus drained.
   Post ERCP was hypotensive, now requiring neo.
   PMH reviewed: Hx of CVA ?TIAs, CAD s/p MI w stents, AS s/p porcine
   valve repair, PVD, HTN, BPH, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, colon
   polyps, diverticulitis, h/o UGI bleed, psoriasis, ED, left CEA
   Yesterday had successful ERCP and perc cholecystomy drain placed
   yesterday. Pus drained from CBD. Remained intubated overnight for
   respiratory failure but extubated this AM. Had reflex bradycardia
   30s-60s. Given dose of lasix this AM. Now on 3 L o2.  I/o +7.5  L,
   since midnight, neg 1L
   On exam, 135/71, HR 67, alert, HOH, lungs with exp wheezes, S1S2 reg,
   abd soft, mild RUQ tenderness, no rebound or guarding, pigtail in
   place.  Labs reviewed
 wbc 12.7 (down from 28). Micro notable for
   enterococcus in blood, also GPC in fluid [**11-22**].
   Impression
   Sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/-
   cholecystitis. Had successful ERCP and perc chole drain yesterday. Will
   discuss with surgery re: their plans and possibility to transfer back
   to VA. Will continue Zosyn for GI coverage at least [**1-31**] more days but
   will need at least 14 day course of amp or vanc for enterococcus
   coverage. C/w Vanco for now. His renal insufficiency appears resolved,
   was volume related. Code status will need to be readdressed. Was DNR
   prior to procedure.
   84 y/o gentleman with h/o CVA, CAD, HTN, HL is admitted with
   choledolcholithiasis/cholecystitis s/p ERCP stent placemnt currently
   septic, intubated and with acute cholecystitis awaiting percutaneous
   cholecystostomy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Secondary to cholangitis s/p ercp and percutaneous
   cholycystostomy tube placement for decompression of gallbladder.
   - Briefly on neo post/op but weaned off with good MAPs since that time,
   patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated since arrival,
   received over 8L of IVF since admission on the evening of [**11-21**]
   - A- line in place, has not needed pressors since post ERCP on [**11-22**]
   - Deferred central line placement since patient has not needed
   pressors, MAPs were generally between 70-80
   - Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of
   possible PNA as has had increased secretions, f/u cx
s may be able to
   narrow antibiotic coverage to ampicillin with further speciation from
   perc tube, will need a prolonged course with PICC placement, which
   cannot be placed until blood cx
s are negative for over 24 hours
   - repeat blood cultures today
   - f/u cultures from percutaneous cholecystomy placement
   - appreciate surgery/ERCP recs
   - FFP prn for any procedures
   - follow up culture speciation
   .
   # S/P intubation: patient was weaned overnight and changed to PSV,
   ventilation/oxygenation improved post lasix administration which he
   received due to decreased UOP, JVP to the mandible and pulmonary edema
   on CXR
UOP responded briskly, patient
s oxygenation improved
   significantly and his BP improved, making it likely that he was
   overloaded and on the downward slope of his Starling curve
   - patient
s sedation was weaned and he was successfully extubated this
   morning
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline, but Cr has decreased from 1.4 on admission to
   1.1 today. Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension as has decreased
   uop and increasing BUN/Cr
   - received over 8L of IVF, looked volume overloaded so gave 40mg of
   lasix he responded with brisk urine output which led to improvement in
   his oxygenation and his urine output remained elevated, gave 500 cc
   back for dramatic UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - monitor uop
   .
   # Cholecystitis/cholangitis: s/p stent placement with large amounts of
   pus from common bile duct. Concern for significant infection in this
   setting. Also concern for a concurrent acute cholecystitis given
   findings of increased gall bladder wall thickness and pericholecysitc
   fluid.  Patient is s/p percutaneous cholecystomy tube placement by IR
   yesterday afternoon, which has been draining brown fluid since that
   time.
   - continue zosyn pending further culture data from cholecystomy tube
   - Appreciate ERCP/Surgery recs
   .
   # h/o CVA/CAD/PVD:
   - will discuss with surgical team regarding ASA, currently on hold due
   to procedures
   - try to get prior records from the VA about baseline cardiac function
   .
   # HL: restart simvastatin when taking po meds
   .
   # Hypertension: continuing to hold home anti-hypertensives for now, for
   the past 18 hours patient has been normotensive, will continue to
   monitor and add back if necessary
   - patient bradycardic with BB and sedation, will hold BB.  Bradycardia
   has been improving with weaning sedation.
   .
   # ? COPD:
   - continue home inhalers
   .
   # BPH:
   - restart home regimen now when he can take po meds

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, enterococcal bacteremia, and cholangitis/cholecystitis secondary to choledocholithiasis. He had a successful ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy drain placement yesterday, and was intubated overnight for respiratory failure. He was extubated this morning after weaning off sedation and improving oxygenation.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to the presence of enterococcus in his blood and fluid from the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today, but the baseline is unclear. He received over 8L of IV fluids and was given lasix, which improved his urine output and oxygenation.
3. Cholecystitis/Cholangitis: The patient has significant infection in the setting of cholangitis and cholecystitis, and is at risk for further complications.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CVA, CAD, and PVD, and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications, particularly in the setting of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has increased secretions and is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's AKI may progress to renal failure if not managed properly.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CVA, CAD, and PVD increases his risk for further cardiovascular complications, particularly in the setting of sepsis.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is at risk for further decline due to the presence of sepsis and cholangitis/cholecystitis.

Plan:

1. Continue IV zosyn and empiric coverage with vancomycin for concern of possible PNA.
2. Repeat blood cultures today and follow up with culture speciation.
3. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's AKI with fluid resuscitation and medication adjustments as needed.
5. Discuss with the surgical team regarding ASA and possible transfer back to the VA.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.

Note: The patient's code status is currently full code, but this may need to be readdressed in the future."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis and enterococcal bacteremia secondary to cholangitis +/- cholecystitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 beats per minute, blood pressure of 171/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status is stable.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.5, hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 100 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 72 and AST of 28.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is also taking medications for COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current medications include piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and metoprolol. The patient is also receiving heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's physical examination shows a temperature of 36.8°C, blood pressure of 171/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* RESPRIATORY FAILURE: The patient is stable and is being managed with mechanical ventilation.
* SEPSIS: The patient is responding to current management, and will continue to receive antibiotics and supportive care.
* RENAL FAILURE: The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.4 on admission to 1.1 today, and is likely pre-renal in nature. The patient will continue to receive medications to support renal function.
* CHOLECYSTITIS-CHOLANGITIS: The patient has a stent in place and is producing large amounts of pus from the common bile duct. The patient will continue to receive antibiotics and supportive care.
* HYPERTENSION: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and will continue to receive antihypertensive medications as needed.
* COPD: The patient will continue to receive home inhalers for management of COPD.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his COPD and sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to his sepsis and hypotension.
* Cholangitis-cholecystitis: The patient is at risk for worsening of his cholangitis-cholecystitis due to the presence of a stent and the production of large amounts of pus.
* Hypertension: The patient is at risk for hypertension due to his underlying condition and the use of certain medications.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying condition and the presence of bacteria in his blood.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and he is being managed with antibiotics and supportive care. The patient's potential medical complications will need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent worsening of his condition."
