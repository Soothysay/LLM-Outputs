You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 127 kg male admitted to the ICU with no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has been on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen lines.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% and ABG results within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating potential sepsis. The patient's kidney function is compromised, with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient's liver function is also compromised, with elevated ALT and AST levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and compromised kidney and liver function may indicate sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation and multi-lumen lines increases the risk of VAP.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient's multi-lumen lines and arterial line increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and compromised circulation increase the risk of DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and prolonged use of invasive ventilation and multi-lumen lines increase the risk of stress ulcer.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's compromised nutritional status and prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to malnutrition.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's compromised kidney function and prolonged use of TPN may lead to electrolyte imbalance.

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. Further laboratory tests and imaging studies may be necessary to guide treatment and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring until OR for closure
   1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation
   awaiting return to OR
   - appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - antibiotic coverage switch to vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   recommendations
   - follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures- still NGTD
   - leucocytosis improving; afebrile
   - will hold off on OR today per surgery to first remove fluid- patient
   with severe anasarca and volume overload
   2. Respiratory- alkalosis improved; last PH 7.38 with PO2 165
   - decrease FiO2 further to 30-35%
   - maintain sedation for OR
   3. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; will need re-culture of peritoneal fluid in OR
   - pan-culture if spikes
   4. Anasarca
   - likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - will start furosemide gtt today for volume removal.  Goal -2L today.
   Titrate to goal I/O or UOP
   - d/w surger regarding amount of fluid removal for operative closure of
   abdominal wound
   5. [**Name (NI) 367**]
   Unclear etiology for patient's [**Name (NI) **]. Differential includes
   most likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
   - continue to trend- improving
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - alpha 1 antitrypsin- 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  cerruloplasmin pending
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor
   - will consider re-evaluation once patient is s/p return to the OR
   7. Hypertension- previously HTN, but now normotensive to slightly
   hypotensive
   - con
t to hold HTN medications.  monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU while awaiting for OR<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy due to a pelvic mass. She recently developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and a side-side anastomosis was performed. She has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she can return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic instability: Her blood pressure is 132/63 mmHg, and her heart rate is 99 bpm, which is tachycardic.
* Respiratory compromise: She is on a ventilator and has a respiratory rate of 9 inspirations per minute.
* Renal dysfunction: Her creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23 mg/dL.
* Coagulopathy: Her platelet count is 313 K/uL, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.7.
* Anasarca: She has significant fluid overload, with an estimated 6,560 mL of fluid infusion and 2,635 mL of fluid output over the past 24 hours.
* Leukocytosis: Her white blood cell count is 25.5 K/uL, and her absolute neutrophil count is 87.0%.
* Lactic acidosis: Her lactic acid level is 2.3 mmol/L.
* Electrolyte imbalance: Her potassium level is 3.6 mEq/L, and her magnesium level is 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acidosis suggest a possible septic process, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise and alkalosis may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction or failure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged INR may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* Anasarca: The patient's significant fluid overload may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, or electrolyte imbalance.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase levels may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation
   awaiting return to OR
   - appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - antibiotic coverage switch to vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   recommendations
   - follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures- still NGTD
   - leucocytosis improving; afebrile
   - likely to OR today for washout and possible closure; will need to
   resend fluid once in OR
   2. Respiratory- alkalosis improved; last PH 7.38 with PO2 165
   - decrease FiO2 further to 30-35%
   - maintain sedation for OR
   3. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; will need re-culture of peritoneal fluid in OR
   - pan-culture if spikes

   Unclear etiology for patient's [**Name (NI) **]. Differential includes
   most likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
   - continue to trend
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - f/u alpha 1 antitrypsin and cerruloplasmin
   - hold lasix and spironolactone in the immediate post-operative setting
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   .
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor
   - will consider re-evaluation once patient is s/p return to the OR
   .
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension, although appears relatively
   well-controlled at this time. Given that she will go back to the OR and
   is normotensive now, will hold anti-HTN and give prn meds as needed.
   - continue to monitor and consider hydralazine or metoprolol prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). She developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with a side-side anastomosis and open abdomen. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring until return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm and blood pressure of 132/63 mmHg. She is well-sedated and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her respiratory status has improved, with a pH of 7.38 and a PO2 of 165 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leucocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 25.5 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 88 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 45 IU/L. Her albumin level is 1.5 g/dL, and her lactate level is 2.3 mmol/L.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation is still present, and she will require return to the operating room for closure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient has leucocytosis and elevated LFTs, which may indicate sepsis.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction.
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which may increase her risk of DVT.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has reported altered mental status, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may be exacerbated by her current medical condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leucocytosis and elevated LFTs may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate hepatic failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
4. DVT: The patient's IVC filter in place may increase her risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to coma and death.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be exacerbated by her current medical condition, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU while awaiting for OR<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed with an open abdomen. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring until surgery for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory status is improving, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 165 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 27 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.5 x 10^9/L, which is improving. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 73 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 43 IU/L. Her albumin level is 1.6 g/dL, which is low. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L and a sodium level of 146 mEq/L.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation is still present, and she is awaiting return to the operating room (OR) for closure.
2. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still require further management to prevent respiratory complications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is improving, but she may still require further management to prevent infection.
4. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca is likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. She will require further management to remove excess fluid and prevent further complications.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be secondary to sepsis or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and prevent further complications.
6. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and her heparin therapy has been held off due to the persistently open abdomen. Further management will be necessary to prevent DVT and pulmonary embolism.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is improving, but further evaluation and management will be necessary to determine the cause and prevent further complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is under control, but further management will be necessary to prevent further complications.

In summary, the patient has several potential medical complications that require further management and evaluation. Her small bowel perforation, respiratory alkalosis, leukocytosis, anasarca, elevated LFTs, DVT, altered mental status, and hypertension all require attention to prevent further complications and ensure optimal patient care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU while awaiting for OR<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation, and the note mentions that the patient is receiving antibiotic coverage for this. However, the patient's leukocytosis is improving, which suggests that the infection may be resolving. Nevertheless, the patient's condition is still critical, and sepsis remains a concern.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal ventilator support settings, but the note mentions that the patient's oxygen saturation levels are stable. However, the patient's respiratory status is still critical, and the patient may require more aggressive respiratory support if their condition deteriorates.
3. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which may be due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. The patient's albumin levels are low, which may contribute to the edema. The patient's IV fluids will need to be carefully managed to prevent further fluid overload.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which may be secondary to sepsis or other factors. The patient's alpha-1 antitrypsin levels are slightly elevated, which may be a concern. The patient's ceruloplasmin levels are pending, which may provide further information about the patient's liver function.
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which may be necessary to prevent pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's DVT risk is still present, and the patient may require anticoagulation therapy once the IVC filter is removed.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is reportedly improved, but the patient's altered mental status earlier in the admission may have been secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status will need to be closely monitored to ensure that the patient is not experiencing any further deterioration.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is normotensive to slightly hypotensive, which may be a concern. The patient's blood pressure will need to be closely monitored to ensure that it remains within a safe range.

In summary, the patient's condition is critical, and the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications. The patient's IV fluids will need to be carefully managed to prevent further fluid overload, and the patient's respiratory status will need to be closely monitored to ensure that the patient is not experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's liver function will need to be closely monitored to ensure that the patient is not experiencing further liver dysfunction, and the patient's DVT risk will need to be closely monitored to ensure that the patient does not experience a pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with recent small bowel perforation and side-side anastomosis. She is currently in the ICU with a small bowel perforation, awaiting return to the operating room (OR) for closure. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory alkalosis, leukocytosis, anasarca, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is critical, and sepsis can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis may progress to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count may indicate infection, which can worsen her condition.
4. Anasarca: The patient's severe fluid overload may lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and the risk of DVT is high, especially with her current condition.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy or other underlying conditions, which can worsen her condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen her condition, especially if not properly managed.
8. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgery increase her risk of infection, which can lead to serious complications.
9. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's fluid overload and cardiac status may lead to hemodynamic instability, which can worsen her condition.
10. Organ Failure: The patient's sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction may lead to organ failure, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Manage the patient's respiratory status with close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust IV fluids and diuretics as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider re-evaluation once she is stable.
5. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Consider re-culture of peritoneal fluid in the OR to ensure proper antibiotic coverage.
7. Consult with hepatology and nephrology teams to manage the patient's liver and kidney function.
8. Consider placement of a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust TPN as necessary.
10. Consult with the surgical team to develop a plan for closure of the abdominal wound."

   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring until OR for closure
    1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation awaiting return to OR
   - appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - antibiotic coverage switch to vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   recommendations
   - follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures- still NGTD
   - leucocytosis improving; afebrile
   - will hold off on OR today per surgery to first remove fluid- patient
   with severe anasarca and volume overload
   2. Respiratory- alkalosis improved; last PH 7.38 with PO2 165
   - decrease FiO2 further to 30-35%
   - maintain sedation for OR
   3. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; will need re-culture of peritoneal fluid in OR
   - pan-culture if spikes
   4. Anasarca
   - likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - will start furosemide gtt today for volume removal.  Goal -2L today.

   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - alpha 1 antitrypsin- 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  cerruloplasmin pending
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor
   - will consider re-evaluation once patient is s/p return to the OR
   8. Hypertension- previously HTN, but now normotensive to slightly
   hypotensive
   - con

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU while awaiting for OR<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy due to a pelvic mass. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis. She now has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU until she can undergo closure of the abdominal wound.

The patient's current condition is stable, but she has several medical complications. She has a small bowel perforation, which is awaiting return to the operating room (OR) for closure. She has also developed anasarca, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. Her respiratory status has improved, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. Her leukocytosis is improving, and her fever curve is trending downward.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and her differential diagnosis includes sepsis and rising LFTs. She has been treated with antibiotics, and her cultures are still pending. She has also been treated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with heparin, but an IVC filter has been placed due to her emergent OR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated LFTs and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Wound Infection: The patient's open abdomen and small bowel perforation increase her risk of developing a wound infection, which can lead to further complications and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing mechanical ventilation and alkalosis suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to prolonged intubation and increased risk of complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated LFTs and altered mental status suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to increased risk of mortality if not treated promptly.
5. DVT: The patient's IVC filter and previous treatment with heparin suggest the possibility of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and increased risk of mortality if not treated promptly.
6. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca is likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels, but it can lead to increased risk of complications and prolonged hospitalization if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of her cultures.
3. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the patient's respiratory support as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
5. Continue to provide anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and pulmonary embolism.
6. Consider re-evaluating the patient's mental status once she is stable and no longer intubated.
7. Continue to provide IV fluids and electrolytes as needed to manage the patient's anasarca.
8. Consider re-evaluating the patient's wound closure plan once she is stable and no longer intubated."

   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR.
   - continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: awaiting OR<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass, s/p supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, who developed small bowel perforation and required resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring until OR for closure.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 85 bpm and blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg
* Respiratory support with minimal vent settings, sedated, and on AC vent settings
* Leukocytosis improving, likely from a GI source
* Anasarca present, likely from IVFs, deconditioning, and low albumin
* Fever curve improved, with recent cultures NGTD and re-cultured, with no organisms found
* Elevated LFTs, likely secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs
* IVC filter in place, hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and persistently open abdomen
* Altered mental status, reportedly improved prior to return to OR, with continued monitoring
* Hypertension, previously HTN, but now normotensive to slightly hypotensive

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Evisceration: The patient has an open abdomen, and there is concern for evisceration. The surgical team recommended that the patient be completely sedated and on AC vent settings to minimize the risk of evisceration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely from a GI source, and elevated LFTs, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's fever curve has improved, but continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that sepsis does not recur.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal vent support settings, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate is tachycardic, and there is a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, if the patient's condition deteriorates.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of renal failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
6. Wound complications: The patient has an open wound, and there is a risk of wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence, if proper wound care is not maintained.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, and there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies if the patient's nutritional needs are not met.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Continued monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status
2. Close monitoring of the patient's wound and IV sites for signs of infection or complications
3. Continued administration of antibiotics and antifungal agents to prevent sepsis and other infections
4. Monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and adjusting the TPN as necessary
5. Consideration of re-evaluation of the patient's mental status once the patient is s/p return to the OR
6. Continued communication with the surgical team regarding the patient's plan of care and any changes in the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   2. Respiratory- on minimal vent support settings.
   - per surgery, patient changed to CMV this AM; will d/w surgical team
   regarding this change
   - lost A-line overnight, but sats have been fine
   - maintain sedation for OR
   3. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; will need re-culture of peritoneal fluid in OR
   - pan-culture if spikes

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) due to a pelvic mass. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, leaving an open abdomen. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for closure, but the procedure was incomplete due to significant edema. She was advised to remain completely sedated and on assisted ventilation settings to prevent evisceration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg, and central venous pressure of 8 mmHg.
* Respiratory support is provided through a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
* The patient has an open abdomen, with a net fluid balance of -1,254 mL, and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.
* The patient has an intravenous (IV) line for antibiotic administration and is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate sepsis, which could worsen if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require more aggressive respiratory support if her condition deteriorates.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's open abdomen and significant edema may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
4. Venous thromboembolism: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but she is still at risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to her prolonged immobility and open abdomen.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could worsen if not properly managed.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels may be compromised, leading to electrolyte imbalances that could worsen her overall condition.
7. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and prolonged immobility may increase her risk of developing infections, which could worsen her condition and prolong her hospital stay."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass, who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy. She recently developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with a side-side anastomosis, resulting in an open abdomen. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring until her return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 142/79 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory support is minimal, with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute.

The patient has anasarca, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 75 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 36 IU/L. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). She has a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure is currently normotensive to slightly hypotensive.

The patient's mental status is altered, possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, but has improved with sedation. She has a history of DVT, but an IVC filter was placed, and she is currently not receiving heparin due to the open abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated LFTs and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which could worsen her condition if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's anasarca and respiratory support may increase her risk of respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated LFTs may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Bleeding: The patient's open abdomen and abnormal coagulation profile may increase her risk of bleeding if not managed effectively.
5. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and anasarca may increase her risk of infection if not managed promptly.
6. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and IVC filter placement may increase her risk of DVT if not managed effectively.
7. Hypotension: The patient's normotensive to slightly hypotensive blood pressure may increase her risk of hypotension if not managed effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory support closely.
2. Manage the patient's sepsis and respiratory failure with antibiotics and respiratory support as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's mental status and liver function tests closely to assess for signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Manage the patient's bleeding risk with platelet transfusions and hemostatic agents as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk with wound care and antibiotics as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's DVT risk with IVC filter placement and anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation after the anastomosis, which was managed conservatively. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and potential return to the operating room (OR) for closure.

The patient's condition has been stable, with improving leukocytosis and afebrile status. She is on minimal ventilator support and has been sedated. Her respiratory status is stable, and her anasarca (edema) is thought to be related to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to sepsis or rising liver enzymes. Her alpha-1 antitrypsin level is slightly elevated, making it difficult to interpret in this setting. Her coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, which may be related to her liver function or sepsis.

The patient has an IVC filter in place, and her DVT prophylaxis has been held due to the persistently open abdomen. She is at risk for hypertensive episodes, and her hypertension medications have been continued.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and slightly elevated alpha-1 antitrypsin level may indicate liver dysfunction or failure, which could lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and other complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's anasarca and respiratory status may increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and potential for hypertensive episodes may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgical procedures increase her risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she undergoes further surgical procedures.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's anasarca and respiratory status may increase her risk of malnutrition, particularly if she has difficulty eating or absorbing nutrients.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for hepatic encephalopathy may increase her risk of psychiatric complications, such as anxiety, depression, or psychosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with SB resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring until she can undergo closure of the open abdomen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/79 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support is minimal, and she is sedated.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation is still open, and she is awaiting return to the operating room for closure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to a gastrointestinal source.
3. Anasarca: The patient has developed swelling in her legs and trunk, which may be related to her IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be related to sepsis or another underlying condition.
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which was placed in the setting of emergent surgery.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has reported altered mental status earlier in her admission, which may be related to hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but she is currently being managed with medication.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole, as well as midazolam, fentanyl, and famotidine. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has an IVC filter in place.

The patient's plan is to continue to monitor her vital signs and laboratory results, and to await return to the operating room for closure of the open abdomen. She will also continue to receive antibiotics and other medications as necessary to manage her potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 61-inch tall, 126 kg male who was admitted with a bowel perforation. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV mode, with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and PIP of 27 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 126/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 3,007 mL and output of 4,660 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.8, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 269 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or perforation, but the patient's peritoneal fluid culture remains positive for 2+ PMN no growth to date.

The patient's medical history is significant for no known drug allergies, and the patient is receiving antibiotics, including fluconazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. The patient is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive peritoneal fluid culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may not be adequate to meet his respiratory needs, and the patient may require more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure may fluctuate, and the patient may require more aggressive blood pressure management.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may require monitoring and potential treatment.
5. Wound infection: The patient's bowel perforation may lead to a wound infection, which could complicate his recovery.
6. Organ failure: The patient's underlying medical condition may lead to organ failure, such as kidney or liver failure.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat may lead to malnutrition, which could complicate his recovery.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (GIST tumor) and recent bowel perforation following a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
* The patient is currently in the ICU with an open abdomen and is being monitored for potential closure.
* The patient has been experiencing anasarca (edema) and bowel edema, which is being managed with Lasix infusions.
* The patient has respiratory failure due to volume overload and is being sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.
* The patient has sepsis and hypotension, which is being managed with antibiotics and vasopressors.
* The patient's lab results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.
* The patient's microbiology results show no growth in the peritoneal fluid.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to bowel perforation and inadequate antibiotic coverage.
* Respiratory failure due to volume overload and inadequate ventilation.
* Hypotension and shock due to inadequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
* Anasarca and bowel edema worsening due to inadequate diuretic therapy.
* Wound infection and dehiscence due to open abdomen and inadequate wound care.
* Prolonged ICU stay and increased risk of nosocomial infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and invasive lines.

To mitigate these complications, the patient's care team should focus on optimizing antibiotic coverage, managing respiratory failure with adequate ventilation and sedation, and addressing hypotension with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Additionally, the patient's wound care should be optimized, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and septic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) and resection with colostomy. She recently developed small bowel perforation, which was repaired with a side-side anastomosis and open abdomen. The patient is currently critically ill with multiple active issues, including anasarca, respiratory failure, small bowel perforation, leukocytosis, and DVT.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/80 mmHg. She is intubated and sedated, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 13.8 x 10^9/L, and a platelet count of 269 x 10^9/L. Her renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and her liver function is mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 75 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 36 IU/L.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and analgesics. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has an IVC filter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and positive Gram stain may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to respiratory failure and mortality.
3. Anasarca: The patient's bowel edema and fluid overload could lead to respiratory failure and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation could lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and mortality if not properly managed.
5. DVT: The patient's IVC filter and heparin gtt may not be sufficient to prevent DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and mortality.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could lead to organ failure and mortality.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid overload and anasarca could lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could exacerbate her respiratory failure and other medical complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple active issues, and careful management is necessary to prevent further complications and mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU care ; awaiting abdominal closure once edema improves<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by small bowel resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction. She has a recent small bowel perforation and underwent resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until her next surgery for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/73 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation studies.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a recent small bowel perforation that is awaiting return to the operating room for closure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation studies.
3. Anasarca: The patient has fluid accumulation in her abdominal cavity, which is likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels.
4. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and her anticoagulation therapy has been held due to the open abdomen.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has reported altered mental status earlier in her admission, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, but she has a history of hypertension.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a GI source.
8. Abnormal liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring her I/Os and adjusting her diuresis as needed to maintain a goal of -2L daily.
2. Continuing her antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole.
3. Re-evaluating her abdominal wound and attempting to close it in a stepwise fashion.
4. Continuing her respiratory support with minimal vent settings.
5. Trending her liver enzymes and re-evaluating her liver function.
6. Holding off on heparin therapy due to the open abdomen.
7. Re-evaluating her mental status once she is post-operative.
8. Continuing her nutrition with TPN and lipids.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her recent surgical procedures and open abdomen.
2. Wound infection: The patient is at risk for developing a wound infection due to her open abdomen.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her recent surgical procedures and open abdomen.
4. Liver failure: The patient is at risk for developing liver failure due to her elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation studies.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk for developing cardiovascular complications due to her hypertension and abnormal coagulation studies.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for developing neurological complications due to her altered mental status and abnormal liver enzymes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with a side-side anastomosis, and now has an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can return to the operating room for closure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure ranging from 119/73 to 153/86 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on minimal ventilator support.

The patient has been experiencing diuresis, with a goal of at least -2L per day, and has been receiving lasix gtt to maintain this goal. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and she has been receiving IV fluids to maintain hydration.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.9-5.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 384-247 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 200 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation that was repaired with a side-side anastomosis, but she still has an open abdomen and is awaiting return to the operating room for closure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal ventilator support and is sedated.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a gastrointestinal source.
4. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which is likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin.
5. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to sepsis or other causes.
6. DVT: The patient had an IVC filter placed due to emergent surgery, and she is currently not receiving heparin.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy or other causes.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive to slightly hypotensive.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Maintenance of diuresis with lasix gtt.
3. Continued IV fluids to maintain hydration.
4. Monitoring of her respiratory status and adjusting ventilator support as needed.
5. Re-evaluation of her liver enzymes and potential causes of elevated liver enzymes.
6. Re-evaluation of her mental status once she is stable.
7. Continued prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
8. Monitoring for signs of VAP.

Overall, the patient is stable, but she has several medical complications that require ongoing monitoring and management."

   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - Hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR, now sedated and unable to assess.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, resulting in an open abdomen. The patient is currently being monitored in the ICU until she is ready for closure of the open abdomen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/73 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 425 and a SpO2 of 100%. Her cardiac status is also stable, with a sinus rhythm and a normal cardiac output.

The patient's laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 10.9 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 76 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 38 IU/L. Her renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 10 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed. She is currently awaiting return to the operating room for closure of the open abdomen.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a mild leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to a gastrointestinal source.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires minimal ventilator support and is sedated.
4. Anasarca: The patient has developed anasarca, which is likely secondary to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
6. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which was placed due to the presence of an IVC filter.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Maintenance of her respiratory status with minimal ventilator support.
3. Management of her anasarca with IV fluids and diuretics.
4. Continued treatment of her leukocytosis with antibiotics.
5. Management of her elevated LFTs with supportive care.
6. Monitoring of her DVT with serial ultrasound examinations.
7. Re-evaluation of her altered mental status once she is s/p return to the operating room.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy. Recently, she had a small bowel perforation and underwent resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She is currently critically ill with several active issues, including anasarca, respiratory failure, small bowel perforation, leukocytosis, and DVT.

24-Hour Events:

* EKG at 07:45 PM showed normal sinus rhythm.
* Lasix gtts were turned off.
* ABG showed pH 7.5, pCO2 45 mmHg, and pO2 90 mmHg.
* The patient received two doses of acetazolamide to allow for ongoing diuresis in preparation for OR.
* The patient was unable to close her belly and was fitted with a mesh to allow for slow closure at bedside.
* She received fluconazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin antibiotics.
* She was on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation.

Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F) at 12 AM and 36.1°C (96.9°F) currently.
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (54-98 bpm).
* Blood pressure: 119/72 mmHg (83-153/86 mmHg).
* Respiratory rate: 11 inspirations per minute (10-13 inspirations per minute).
* SpO2: 99%.
* CVP: 4 mmHg (4-14 mmHg).

Lab Results:

* WBC: 10.9, 7.5, 7.7, 5.5, and 5.6.
* Hct: 37.1, 32.4, 32.7, 28.1, and 30.0.
* Plt: 384, 326, 369, 269, and 247.
* Cr: 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3.
* TCO2: 36.
* Glucose: 90, 121, 107, 116, and 105.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is on mechanical ventilation. She may develop respiratory failure if her respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and increased risk of infection.
3. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation, which can lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
4. DVT: The patient has a DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or bone marrow dysfunction.
6. Hypovolemia: The patient has a significant fluid deficit, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, cardiovascular instability, and decreased organ perfusion.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG shows metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by various factors, including lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or kidney disease.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue aggressive diuresis to manage her anasarca and fluid overload. She should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, small bowel perforation, DVT, leukocytosis, hypovolemia, and metabolic acidosis."

   and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB
   perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with open
   abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring until closure.
   Pt remains critically ill with several active issues
   1.   Anasarca, with bowel edema.  Underwent aggressive diuresis to try
   to achieve neg fluid balance
 contraction alkalosis     ensued,
   switched to acetazolamide. Since she went to the OR and was unable to
   close, plan for 2L neg qd as BP and CR tolerates. Will use Lasix unless
   contraction worsens. Would d/c Albumin- discuss with surgery
   2.  Resp Failure: volume overload, sedation with open abdomen
         Heavily sedated on fent 150/versed 2
 continue AC for now
   cannot wean until abdomen is closed
   3. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
 now plan
   for slow closure at bedside
surgery following closely
   4. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; re-cultured.  NGTD.  Gram stain without
   organisms
   5. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation and was taken to the operating room, but was unable to close the abdomen due to bowel edema. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring and treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/72 mmHg. She is intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Her respiratory support is being maintained with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute.

The patient has several active medical issues, including:

1. Anasarca (edema) with bowel edema, which has been treated with diuresis and acetazolamide.
2. Respiratory failure due to volume overload and open abdomen, which is being managed with sedation and continued mechanical ventilation.
3. Small bowel perforation, which has been treated with resection and side-side anastomosis, and is now planned for slow closure at bedside.
4. Leukocytosis, which is likely due to a gastrointestinal source and is being treated with antibiotics.
5. DVT, which is being managed with an IVC filter and hold off on heparin therapy due to the patient's persistently open abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.9-7.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 37.1-32.4%
* Platelet count: 384-247 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90-107 mg/dL
* Microbiology: yeast from peritoneal fluid

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued diuresis and acetazolamide therapy for anasarca
* Maintenance of respiratory support with mechanical ventilation
* Slow closure of the abdomen at bedside
* Continued antibiotics for leukocytosis
* Hold off on heparin therapy due to DVT and persistently open abdomen
* Close monitoring of the patient's condition and potential return to the operating room.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of anasarca and bowel edema
* Respiratory failure due to continued volume overload
* Infection and sepsis due to open abdomen and small bowel perforation
* Bleeding and hematoma due to continued anticoagulation therapy
* Return to the operating room for closure of the abdomen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), followed by a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with a side-side anastomosis, resulting in an open abdomen.

The patient's current condition is critical, with several active issues:

1. Anasarca and bowel edema, requiring aggressive diuresis to achieve negative fluid balance. However, this has led to contraction alkalosis, and the patient is now receiving acetazolamide.
2. Respiratory failure due to volume overload and sedation with an open abdomen. She is heavily sedated and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation.
3. Small bowel perforation, which is being managed with a slow closure at the bedside.
4. Leukocytosis, likely of gastrointestinal origin, which is being treated with antibiotics.
5. DVT, for which an IVC filter has been placed.

The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory status due to ongoing volume overload and sedation.
* Infection and sepsis related to the small bowel perforation and open abdomen.
* Development of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, due to the patient's critical illness.
* Thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, despite the presence of an IVC filter.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction, related to the patient's underlying disease and recent surgical interventions.
* Nutritional deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's altered gut function and ongoing fluid losses.

Close monitoring and management of these potential complications will be essential to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring until OR for closure
      1. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation awaiting return to OR for closure
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until [**3-10**].
   - Follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures. Repeated in OR- yeast so far
   - Leukocytosis improving; afebrile
   - Could not close abdomen, trying to bring abdominal wound closer
   together in stepwise fashion.  Con
t with goal diuresis of -2L daily,
   autodiuresed 5L over the day
   - Cont to monitor I/Os, lasix gtt prn to maintain goals, though will

   2. Respiratory- On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   3. Leukocytosis- Improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - Fever curve improved
   - Recent cultures NGTD; re-cultured.  yeast.  Gram stain without
   organisms
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   4. Anasarca
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - 25%albumin q8H per surgery recommendations, requested dc today with
   trophic TF to hold prior to surgery
   5. [**Name (NI) 367**]
   Unclear etiology for patient's [**Name (NI) **]. Differential includes
   most likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis and rising LFTs.
   - Continue to trend- improving
   - Liver biopsy done in OR yesterday - will f/u results
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin- 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   6. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - Hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   7. Altered Mental Status
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status earlier this admission,
   thought possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Reportedly much
   improved prior to return to OR, now sedated and unable to assess.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   8. Hypertension- previously HTN, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU, awaiting abdominal wound culture<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until the wound can be closed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 137/83 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on 40% FiO2.
* Respiratory support: Minimal ventilator settings, with a respiratory rate of 12 and a tidal volume of 550 mL.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is normotensive, with a blood pressure of 137/83 mmHg.
* Abdominal: The patient has an open abdomen with an ostomy, and the wound is being monitored.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count: 5.5-5.6 K/uL
	+ Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 269-247 K/uL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mEq/L
	+ Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 107-109 mg/dL
* Imaging: A pending chest X-ray (CXR) is scheduled.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a small bowel perforation and an open abdomen, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal ventilator settings, and respiratory failure can occur if the settings are not adjusted accordingly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but cardiac complications can still occur, especially if the patient develops sepsis or respiratory failure.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has an open abdomen, which increases the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
5. Wound infection: The patient's open abdomen and ostomy increase the risk of wound infection.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC filter in place, but DVT can still occur, especially if the patient is immobile for an extended period.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which can recur if the patient develops sepsis or respiratory failure.
8. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which can recur if the patient develops sepsis or respiratory failure.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to her current condition. Close monitoring and timely interventions are necessary to prevent or manage these complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU, awaiting abdominal wound closure<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). She recently developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an open abdomen, awaiting closure. She is on minimal ventilator settings and is sedated.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, which is improving, and elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to sepsis. She also has anasarca, likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, and she has a history of hypertension, which is currently under control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient's open abdomen and recent small bowel perforation increase the risk of further abdominal complications, such as intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulas.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's minimal ventilator settings and sedation may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and altered mental status may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's significant autodiuresis and anasarca may increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI).
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's anasarca and altered mental status may increase the risk of nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and open abdomen increase the risk of infection, which could spread to other parts of the body.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and perforation. She was previously intubated and sedated, and the note indicates that the patient's condition has been stable, with improvements in her respiratory and leukocytic indices.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of SB perforation and anastomosis, there is a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Wound infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgery increase the risk of wound infection, which can lead to further complications and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if her ventilation settings are not adjusted properly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate a risk of renal failure if not addressed promptly.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated LFTs and liver biopsy results suggest potential hepatic dysfunction, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. DVT: The patient's IVC filter and previous history of DVT increase the risk of further thrombotic events, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's previous history of hypertension and current normotensive status suggest that hypertension may be a concern, especially if it is not managed properly.
8. Anasarca: The patient's fluid overload and low albumin levels increase the risk of anasarca, which can lead to further complications if not addressed promptly.

Given these potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's caregivers should also consider implementing strategies to prevent further complications, such as maintaining proper wound care, managing fluid balance, and addressing any underlying infections or sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy due to a pelvic mass. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, resulting in an open abdomen.

The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo closure of the abdomen. She has been experiencing autodiuresis, with a total output of 5L over the day, and is still on minimal ventilator settings. She has a fever curve that has improved, and her leukocytosis is likely due to a gastrointestinal source.

The patient has anasarca, likely caused by IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels. She has been prescribed 25% albumin every 8 hours to help with fluid management.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and a liver biopsy was performed in the operating room yesterday. The results are pending. She has been tested for hepatitis A, B, and C, and her results are negative. Her alpha-1 antitrypsin level is slightly elevated, but it is difficult to interpret in this setting.

The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place due to the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is currently not receiving heparin due to the open abdomen and the risk of bleeding.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she is currently sedated and unable to assess. Her blood pressure is currently normotensive, and she is being monitored for any changes.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Wound infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgery make her susceptible to wound infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated LFTs and fever curve suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her ventilator settings are increased or if she develops pneumonia.
4. Anasarca: The patient's fluid management is crucial to prevent further fluid accumulation and potential complications.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs and liver biopsy suggest the possibility of liver failure, which could lead to serious complications if left untreated.
6. DVT: The patient's IVC filter is in place to prevent DVT, but she is still at risk for developing a DVT if she is not adequately anticoagulated.
7. Mental status changes: The patient's altered mental status could worsen if she is not closely monitored and managed.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, but she may be at risk for hypertension if her medication regimen is not managed properly.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure her safe recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass (GIST tumor) s/p supracervical hysterectomy
   and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB
   perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with open
   abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring until closure. [**3-5**] went to the OR and
   was unable to close.
   Pt remains critically ill with several active issues
   1.   Anasarca, with bowel edema.  Underwent aggressive diuresis to try
   to achieve neg fluid balance
 contraction alkalosis     ensued,
   switched to acetazolamide. Now autodiuresing rapidly. Frequent
   electrolyte checks. D/C
d albumin. Significant improvement in abd
   distension.
   2.  Resp Failure: volume overload, sedation with open abdomen.
         Heavily sedated on fent 250/versed 3
 continue AC for now
   cannot wean until abdomen is closed
   3. Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
 now plan
   for slow closure at bedside
surgery following closely
   4. Leukocytosis- improving.  Most likely GI source
   - cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID (plan is until [**3-10**] for 10d course.)
   - fever curve improved
   - recent cultures NGTD; re-cultured.  NGTD.  Gram stain without
   organisms
   5. DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - hold off on heparin in the setting of likely return to the OR and
   persistently open abdomen
   6. Trophic TF started.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). She developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was taken to the operating room (OR) for resection and colostomy. After the procedure, she developed a small bowel perforation and was taken back to the OR for resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient remains critically ill with several active issues, including anasarca with bowel edema, respiratory failure, small bowel perforation, leukocytosis, and DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anasarca with bowel edema: The patient's condition is likely to worsen if the anasarca is not adequately managed, leading to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the risk of further deterioration is high. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and sedation may lead to respiratory muscle weakness, weaning difficulties, and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation is a high-risk situation, and the risk of peritonitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure is significant if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely to be a result of the surgical trauma and infection. If left untreated, it may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and increased risk of infection.
5. DVT: The patient's DVT is a high-risk situation, and the risk of pulmonary embolism is significant if not managed promptly and effectively. The IVC filter in place may not provide adequate protection against pulmonary embolism.
6. Trophic TF: The patient's trophic TF may lead to further complications, such as pressure ulcers, skin breakdown, and increased risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Aggressive management of anasarca with bowel edema, including diuresis, electrolyte management, and frequent monitoring.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, with adjustments to sedation and mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Prompt management of the small bowel perforation, including antibiotics, fluids, and surgical intervention if necessary.
4. Aggressive management of leukocytosis, including antibiotics and source control.
5. Close monitoring of the patient's DVT, with consideration of anticoagulation therapy and IVC filter removal if necessary.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's trophic TF, with consideration of pressure ulcer prevention and wound care measures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with anasarca, bowel edema, and delayed closure of the surgical wound. The patient underwent a liver biopsy yesterday and is receiving antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/79 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's abdominal distension has improved, and the surgical dressing is in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's anasarca and bowel edema may increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if the surgical wound becomes infected.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if the lung injury worsens or if the patient develops respiratory muscle weakness.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status may worsen if the patient develops arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bowel edema may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver biopsy may have caused liver injury, which may lead to liver failure or dysfunction.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's fluid imbalance and anasarca may increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's surgical wound and catheters may become infected, leading to sepsis and other complications.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in vitamins and minerals.
9. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels may be difficult to control, particularly if the patient is receiving TPN or has underlying insulin resistance.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and anasarca may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, particularly if the patient is not turned regularly.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-20**] through [**3-2**]:
   Pulmonary vascular congestion and central pulmonary artery enlargement
   that had been relatively unchanged since [**2-20**]. Heart size is top
   normal.  Findings raise possibility of idiopathic and other causes of
   pulmonary
   hypertension, including right to left shunting. Pleural effusion if any
   is small. Atelectasis at the base of the left lung has been stable for
   at least four days. Upper lungs grossly clear.

   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation
   awaiting return to OR for closure
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - [**Doctor First Name **] at bedside today for partial closure, patient required propofol
   and 1 dose vec for paralysis which she tolerated, plan for primary
   closure likely Thursday
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until [**3-10**].
   - Follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures. Repeated in OR growing [**Female First Name (un) 188**]
   albicans (low numbers)
   - Leukocytosis improved; afebrile
   - Con
t with goal diuresis of -2L daily. Will monitor I/Os, patient has
   been autodiuresing, lasix gtt prn to maintain goals, though will not
   likely require
   - PM lytes given significant autodiuresis
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, improving.  Most likely GI source
   - Cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - Fever curve continuing to improve
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Albumin25% q8H per surgery recommendations was dc'd yesterday.
   Trophic TF started yesterday with high residuals so was discontinued
   for now
   - Per [**Doctor First Name 458**] this am, started on reglan so that TF can be restarted later
   today, will give re-trial later this afternoon
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes as above
   # Transaminitis
    Downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.  Patient
   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].  Differential includes most
   likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis.
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   -  SC heparin
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU pending closure of abdomen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis, leaving her with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring until her abdomen can be closed.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on minimal ventilator support settings and is sedated.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is stable, and she is normotensive.
* Neurological: She is intubated and sedated, making it difficult to assess her mental status.
* Abdominal: She has an open abdomen with clamps in place.
* Fluid status: She is diuresing well, with a total fluid output of 5,880 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 5.6, Hct 27.2, Platelet count 247.
	+ Blood chemistry: Glucose 116, Creatinine 0.4, Bilirubin 0.4, Albumin 2.8.
	+ Liver function tests: ALT 43, AST 96, Alkaline phosphatase 77, Total bilirubin 2.9.
	+ Electrolytes: Potassium 4.0, Sodium 141, Chloride 111, Bicarbonate 24.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Small bowel perforation
* Pulmonary vascular congestion and central pulmonary artery enlargement, which may be due to idiopathic pulmonary hypertension or right-to-left shunting
* Leukocytosis, which is improving but may be secondary to a gastrointestinal source
* Transaminitis, which is downtrending but unclear etiology
* Anasarca, which is improving but may be secondary to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin
* Hypertension, which is stable but previously hypertensive
* DVT, which was previously treated with heparin and an IVC filter
* Altered mental status, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole as per ID recommendations
* Monitoring the patient's fluid status and adjusting her diuresis as needed
* Restarting trophic tube feeds once her gut function improves
* Continuing to monitor her respiratory status and adjusting her ventilator settings as needed
* Following up on peritoneal fluid cultures and re-evaluating her liver function tests
* Maintaining her IVC filter and heparin prophylaxis
* Re-evaluating her mental status once she is extubated and able to be transferred out of the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of GIST tumor, peritonitis, and open abdomen, currently admitted to the ICU for monitoring and treatment. She has a small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis and is awaiting return to the OR for closure. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole, per ID recommendations. She has leukocytosis, which is improving, and is afebrile. The patient has not been able to close her abdomen due to the open wound, and is being managed with stepwise closure and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of peritonitis and open abdomen, which increases the risk of developing sepsis. The patient's leukocytosis and elevated LFTs may be indicative of sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's AP chest X-ray shows pulmonary vascular congestion and central pulmonary artery enlargement, which may indicate idiopathic or other causes of pulmonary hypertension.
3. Right-to-Left Shunting: The patient's AP chest X-ray also shows a possibility of right-to-left shunting, which may be contributing to her pulmonary hypertension.
4. Atelectasis: The patient has atelectasis at the base of the left lung, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient's AP chest X-ray shows a small pleural effusion, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.
6. Anasarca: The patient has anasarca, which may be secondary to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be secondary to sepsis or other underlying liver disease.
8. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which may be contributing to her altered mental status.
9. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be contributing to her altered mental status.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient is receiving minimal vent support, which may be insufficient to manage her respiratory distress."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU pending closure of abdomen<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, leaving an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring until closure of the abdomen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/96 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 5.6 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 96 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 43 U/L. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is 222 IU/L, and her albumin level is 2.8 g/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary vascular congestion and central pulmonary artery enlargement, which may be indicative of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension or right-to-left shunting. There is also evidence of atelectasis at the base of the left lung.

The patient's medical history is significant for a GIST tumor, peritonitis, and an open abdomen. She has a history of small bowel perforation and anastomosis, and is currently receiving antibiotic therapy for infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Closure of the abdomen: The patient will undergo closure of the abdomen in the operating room (OR) as soon as possible.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive antibiotic therapy for infection.
3. Liver function tests: The patient's LFTs will be monitored to ensure that they are within normal limits.
4. Pulmonary function tests: The patient will undergo pulmonary function tests to assess her lung function and diagnose any potential pulmonary hypertension.
5. Cardiac function tests: The patient will undergo cardiac function tests to assess her cardiac function and diagnose any potential cardiac issues.
6. Nutrition: The patient will receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids to support her nutritional needs.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient will receive stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker (Famotidine) to prevent stress ulcers.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her open abdomen and potential infection.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may be at risk for pulmonary hypertension due to her central pulmonary artery enlargement and pulmonary vascular congestion.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient may be at risk for cardiac issues due to her history of cardiac disease and potential cardiac complications.
4. Liver failure: The patient may be at risk for liver failure due to her elevated LFTs and potential liver damage.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her atelectasis and potential respiratory complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and BSO followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, leaving an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until closure of the abdomen. Her vital signs are stable, and her laboratory results show leukocytosis and elevated LFTs. The patient's plan of care includes closure of the abdomen, antibiotic therapy, and monitoring of her LFTs and pulmonary function. Her potential medical complications include sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac issues, liver failure, and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass (GIST tumor) who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) resection and colostomy. She developed small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed, resulting in an open abdomen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation, with autodiuresis and marked improvement in anasarca and bowel edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to volume overload, sedation, and open abdomen.
2. Small Bowel Perforation: The patient has a high risk of small bowel perforation recurrence, which may require urgent surgical intervention.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a resolved leukocytosis, but it may recur due to ongoing inflammatory response or infection.
4. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but is at risk for DVT due to immobility and open abdomen.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to open abdomen and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies if the gut is not functioning properly.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a high risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, due to ongoing inflammatory response and surgical manipulation.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to sedation, volume overload, and underlying cardiac disease.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring until OR for closure
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation
   awaiting return to OR for closure
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs
   - [**Doctor First Name **] at bedside today for partial closure, patient required propofol
   and 1 dose vec for paralysis which she tolerated, plan for primary
   closure likely Thursday
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until [**3-10**].
   - Follow-up peritoneal fluid cultures. Repeated in OR growing [**Female First Name (un) 188**]
   albicans (low numbers)
   - Leukocytosis improved; afebrile
   - Con
t with goal diuresis of -2L daily. Will monitor I/Os, patient has
   been autodiuresing, lasix gtt prn to maintain goals, though will not
   likely require
   - PM lytes given significant autodiuresis
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, improving.  Most likely GI source
   - Cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - Fever curve continuing to improve
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Albumin25% q8H per surgery recommendations was dc'd yesterday.
   Trophic TF started yesterday with high residuals so was discontinued
   for now
   - Per [**Doctor First Name 458**] this am, started on reglan so that TF can be restarted later
   today, will give re-trial later this afternoon
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes as above
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.  Patient
   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].  Differential includes most
   likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis.
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   -  SC heparin
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].  Differential includes most
   likely elevated LFTs secondary to sepsis.
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass following supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), who developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent perforation, requiring resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.
* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring until she can undergo primary closure in the operating room (OR), which is likely to occur on Thursday.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (bpm).
* The patient's laboratory results show:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC) 5.6-9.0 x 10^9/L
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb) 8.2-11.1 g/dL
	+ Platelet count (Plt) 229-244 x 10^9/L
	+ Creatinine (Cr) 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 24-26.1 mg/dL
	+ Electrolyte levels: sodium (Na) 139-146 mmol/L, potassium (K) 3.7-4.1 mmol/L, and chloride (Cl) 103-107 mmol/L
	+ Liver function tests (LFTs): alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 37-76 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 37-76 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALK) 87-121 IU/L, and bilirubin 0.3-2.9 mg/dL
	+ Amylase and lipase levels: 26-121 IU/L and 87-121 IU/L, respectively
	+ Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) 14.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 34.0 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.3
* The patient has a history of leukocytosis, which is improving, and is suspected to be of gastrointestinal origin.
* The patient has a small bowel perforation and is awaiting return to the OR for closure.
* The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), and fluconazole, as per infectious disease (ID) recommendations.
* The patient has a history of altered mental status, which is currently unable to be assessed due to sedation and mechanical ventilation.
* The patient has a DVT filter in place and is receiving subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of small bowel perforation and ongoing sepsis, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if her ventilator settings are not optimized or if she develops a respiratory infection.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's small bowel perforation and ongoing sepsis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
4. DVT and pulmonary embolism: The patient's DVT filter and ongoing anticoagulation therapy may not prevent the development of pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and history of liver biopsy may indicate liver damage or failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, and encephalopathy.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage or failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
7. Infection: The patient's ongoing sepsis and antibiotic therapy may not prevent the development of new infections, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of liver biopsy may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, disorientation, and seizures.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and provide prompt interventions to prevent or manage them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU care- likely OR tomorrow for primary closure<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis, resulting in an open abdomen.

The patient is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo closure of the open abdomen in the operating room. The patient is on minimal vent support settings, sedated, and receiving IV fluids. She is autodiuresing, which is being monitored and managed with lasix as needed.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient's recent SB perforation is still awaiting closure in the operating room, which is likely to occur tomorrow.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving, but the source is unclear. The most likely source is the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which is likely due to IV fluids, deconditioning, and low albumin levels.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is downtrending, but the etiology is unclear. The patient had a liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which was placed in the setting of emergent OR.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is stable, but she is being monitored closely.

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, fluconazole, famotidine, and fentanyl. She is also receiving IV fluids, TPN with lipids, and replete with fiber.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for leukocytosis, transaminitis, and altered liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple potential medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management of her IV fluids, electrolytes, and medications to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU care- likely OR tomorrow for primary closure<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and resection, followed by a recent small bowel perforation and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring until she can undergo primary closure of the open abdomen.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 100.4°F, HR 94 bpm, BP 116/66 mmHg, RR 13 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Respiratory support: On minimal vent support settings with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 12, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O
* Cardiovascular: Normotensive, with a CVP of 6 mmHg
* Neurologic: Intubated and sedated
* Abdominal: Open wound with clamps in place
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC count: 6.1-9.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 25.5-28.3%
	+ Plt: 33-109 K/uL
	+ Cr: 0.3-0.5 mg/dL
	+ TCO2: 31 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 91-157 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.6/38.8/1.2, ALT/AST: 37/76, Alk Phos/T Bili: 87/2.9, Amylase/Lipase: 26/121, Differential-Neuts: 87.0%, Band: 1.0%, Lymph: 7.0%, Mono: 3.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Fibrinogen: 200 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.3 g/dL, LDH: 225 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 4.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation and is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal vent support settings, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if her condition deteriorates.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's normotensive status may not persist, and she may develop cardiac complications such as hypertension or hypotension.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient is intubated and sedated, and there is a risk of neurologic complications such as cerebral edema or seizures.
5. Abdominal complications: The patient has an open abdomen, and there is a risk of abdominal complications such as bleeding, infection, or evisceration.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient has altered mental status, and there is a risk of developing metabolic complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
7. Coagulation disorders: The patient has a history of liver biopsy and may be at risk for developing coagulation disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results
2. Maintenance of her respiratory support settings
3. Administration of antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed
4. Monitoring of her abdominal wound and open abdomen
5. Re-evaluation of her mental status once she is extubated
6. Monitoring of her electrolyte levels and glucose control
7. Consideration of further interventions such as liver biopsy or abdominal closure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). She developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired, but an open abdomen was left for monitoring. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring until she can undergo closure of the open abdomen.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with minimal vent support settings. She has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation and is at risk for developing an infection. The patient's urine culture is pending, and the peritoneal fluid is growing yeast.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which may be due to a gastrointestinal source.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to liver biopsy or another underlying condition.
4. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place and is receiving heparin prophylaxis.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has a history of hypertension.
7. Anasarca: The patient has significant fluid accumulation, which may be due to IVF, deconditioning, and low albumin.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal vent support settings and may require further respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection risk is high due to her recent surgical procedures and the presence of a central line.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but she is still at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may increase her risk for cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's fluid accumulation and potential sepsis may increase her risk for developing renal failure.
5. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis and potential sepsis may increase her risk for developing liver failure.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   have been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Currently
   pt with open abdomen, closing with mesh in stages with plan to return
   to OR imminently for complete closure after adequate diuresis.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- likely to OR this
   afternoon

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was resected and anastomosed. The patient has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring until the planned return to the operating room for closure. She has a history of altered mental status, hypertension, and leukocytosis, which is improving. The patient is intubated and sedated, and has been receiving TPN and IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of perforation and anastomosis, which increases the risk of sepsis. The presence of yeast in the peritoneal fluid and the patient's leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, and the ventilator settings are being adjusted as needed.
3. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which may be related to her open abdomen and the use of IV fluids. The patient's albumin levels are low, which may contribute to the edema.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to her liver biopsy or other underlying conditions. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored closely.
5. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which was inserted in the setting of emergent surgery. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to her underlying medical condition or the use of sedatives. The patient's mental status will be re-evaluated once she is extubated and able to be assessed.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being monitored closely, and her medications will be adjusted as needed.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum production has increased, which may indicate the development of pneumonia. The patient is being monitored closely for signs of pneumonia, and her sputum cultures are pending.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   have been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Currently
   pt with open abdomen, closing with mesh in stages with plan to return
   to OR imminently for complete closure after adequate diuresis.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until today, will
   consider dc.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results
   - Pt intubated >10 days, now with increased sputum production, concern
   for PNA, is broadly covered, however missing atypical [**Last Name (LF) 2260**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   continue to monitor and follow up sputum results.  CXR today to
   evaluate for evolving pneumonia
   - Continue to follow diuresis as patient rec'd 1.5L and 2units blood in
   OR yesterday, can consider lasix gtt again if becomes volume
   overloaded.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   - Given no further OR, will attempt vent and sedation wean today
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, slight improvement today
   - Cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   -follow up cultures as above.
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Will re-attempt tube feeds today and consider restarting reglan as
   per surgery, will hold in the setting of high residuals, though
   awaiting return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.  Patient
   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a complex medical history, including a recent small bowel perforation and subsequent resection and anastomosis. She is currently in the ICU with an open abdomen, being monitored for potential complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/93 mmHg. She is intubated and sedated, with minimal vent support settings.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.8 K/uL (increased)
* Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL (decreased)
* Platelet count: 264 K/uL (increased)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 114 mg/dL (elevated)
* Creatinine: 0.3 mg/dL (normal)
* Glucose: 91 mg/dL (normal)
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL (decreased)
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L (elevated)
* Fibrinogen: 200 mg/dL (elevated)
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL (normal)
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL (normal)
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL (normal)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: pending
* Sputum culture: pending
* Blood cultures: negative
* Urine culture: negative

The patient's medical history and current status suggest several potential complications, including:

* Sepsis: the patient's increased white blood cell count and temperature may indicate an ongoing infection.
* Pneumonia: the patient's increased sputum production and concern for PNA may indicate a developing pneumonia.
* Leukocytosis: the patient's elevated white blood cell count may be a sign of an inflammatory response or infection.
* Anasarca: the patient's fluid overload and edema may be contributing to her respiratory distress and decreased lung function.
* Transaminitis: the patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or disease.
* DVT: the patient's IVC filter and prophylactic heparin may be necessary to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
* Altered mental status: the patient's reported altered mental status may be related to hepatic encephalopathy, medication side effects, or other factors.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
* Adjust antibiotics and antifungals as necessary based on culture results.
* Consider weaning sedation and vent support settings.
* Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload and edema with diuretics and fluid restriction.
* Consider restarting enteral nutrition and restarting reglan as per surgery.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and consider evaluating for hepatic encephalopathy or other causes of altered mental status.
* Continue to follow up with the patient's liver biopsy results and consider repeating the test if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels and consider replacing these electrolytes as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and consider adjusting medication as necessary.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current status require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Will dc vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow diuresis as patient rec'd 1.5L and 2units blood in
   OR yesterday, can consider lasix gtt again if becomes volume
   overloaded.  Goal I/O 500-1L negative today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated.
   - Given no further OR, will attempt change to PSV today and wean
   sedation (preferentially weaning versed as patient will likely require
   fentanyl for pain control given persistently open abdominal wound).
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, slight improvement today
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - D/C abx as above
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Will re-attempt tube feeds today, will hold in the setting of high
   residuals.
   # Transaminitis
   - Was downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.
   Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, now with
   some evidence of ?scleral icterus.  LFTs today showing slightly
   increased T. bili and LDH.  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds today, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by small bowel resection and colostomy due to small bowel obstruction. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen, and attempts to close it have been unsuccessful due to significant edema.

The patient has been in the ICU for over 10 days, intubated and sedated. She has been receiving TPN and has had trophic tube feeds started. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is on minimal ventilator support settings. Her leukocytosis has improved slightly, but the source of infection remains unclear. The patient has been pan-cultured, and all cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's liver function tests have shown some evidence of transaminitis, and a liver biopsy was performed on [**2180-3-5**]. The patient's alpha-1 antitrypsin level is slightly elevated, but the significance of this is unclear in this setting.

The patient has an IVC filter in place due to a known DVT, and she is receiving heparin therapy. Her mental status has been altered, possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, but it is unclear whether this is related to her liver function or another factor.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and open abdomen make her susceptible to sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, and the patient has been pan-cultured, but all cultures have been negative to date.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for over 10 days, and her sputum production has increased. Although her CXR is clear, and her clinical status is not concerning for VAP, she is still at risk for developing this complication.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis and liver biopsy results suggest that her liver function may be compromised. This could lead to further complications, such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.
4. DVT/PE: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but she is still at risk for developing a DVT or PE, especially given her immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Anasarca: The patient's open abdomen and fluid overload make her susceptible to anasarca. Her albumin levels are low, which could contribute to this complication.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but she may be at risk for developing hypertension due to her prolonged hospitalization and immobility.
7. Sedation withdrawal: The patient has been sedated for over 10 days, and she may be at risk for sedation withdrawal syndrome if she is weaned too quickly.

Given the patient's complex medical status and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her care plan as needed to prevent further complications and promote her recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   have been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Currently
   pt with open abdomen, closing with mesh in stages with plan to return
   to OR imminently for complete closure after adequate diuresis.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Cont  vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID recommendations until today.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results
   - Pt intubated >10 days, now with increased sputum production, concern
   for PNA, is broadly covered, however missing atypical [**Last Name (LF) 2260**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   continue to monitor and follow up sputum results.  CXR today to
   evaluate for evolving pneumonia
   - Continue to follow diuresis as patient rec'd 1.5L and 2units blood in
   OR yesterday, can consider lasix gtt again if becomes volume
   overloaded.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On AC with minimal vent settings.  Sedated
   - Given no further OR, will attempt vent and sedation wean today
   # Leukocytosis - Stable, slight improvement today
   - Cont vanco/pip-tazo/fluc per ID as above
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above
   - Pan-culture if spikes
   -follow up cultures as above.
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Will re-attempt tube feeds today and consider restarting reglan as
   per surgery, will hold in the setting of high residuals, though
   awaiting return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending. Unclear etiology for patient's transaminitis.  Patient
   is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - No need to continue to follow unless clinically indicated
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Condition:**

* Patient is a 44-year-old female with a pelvic mass who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO).
* She developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent resection and colostomy, followed by small bowel perforation and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.
* The patient has an open abdomen with significant edema, making it difficult to close.

**Current Medications:**

* Vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), and fluconazole for antibiotic coverage.
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
* Midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl for sedation.
* Famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Prophylactic anticoagulation with sc heparin.

**Lab Results:**

* White blood cell count (WBC) increased, but stable.
* Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) decreased.
* Platelet count (Plt) decreased.
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) elevated.
* Glucose levels have been fluctuating.
* Lactic acid level elevated.
* Albumin level decreased.
* Liver function tests (LFTs) show transaminitis, but downtrending.

**Imaging and Microbiology:**

* Chest X-ray (CXR) pending to evaluate for evolving pneumonia.
* Sputum culture pending, with no growth to date.
* Peritoneal fluid growing yeast (Candida albicans).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** Given the patient's history of intubation and increased sputum production, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's open abdomen and Candida growth in peritoneal fluid increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. **DVT:** Despite having an IVC filter in place, the patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and increased risk factors.
4. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there is a risk of developing hypertension if not closely monitored.
5. **Anasarca:** The patient's edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory compromise and other complications.
6. **Transaminitis:** The patient's liver function is still abnormal, and there is a risk of developing liver failure if not closely monitored.
7. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of complications.

**Plan:**

* Continue antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole.
* Monitor the patient's WBC count and adjust antibiotic coverage as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's open abdomen and edema with diuresis and IV fluids.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider restarting reglan for gastrointestinal motility and restarting tube feeds once the patient's bowel function returns."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with an open abdomen and prolonged sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 133/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has undergone surgery to close the fascia, but the wound is not yet closed. The plan is to continue with woundvac and allow the wound to granulate.

The patient is currently receiving respiratory support through a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 26 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 108 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 35 K/uL. The patient's white blood cell count is normal, with a count of 6.9 K/uL.

The patient's microbiology results show that the peritoneal wash demonstrated yeast, and the sputum culture is pending. The patient's differential white blood cell count shows a neutrophil count of 87.0%, a band count of 1.0%, a lymphocyte count of 7.0%, a monocyte count of 3.0%, and an eosinophil count of 0.0%.

The patient's plan includes weaning from sedation, starting with midazolam (Versed), and potentially switching to fentanyl and dexmedetomidine or propofol if necessary. The patient will also be evaluated for extubation and will be limited by prolonged sedation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Wound infection: The open abdomen and prolonged sedation increase the risk of wound infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged sedation and respiratory support may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's prolonged sedation and cardiovascular instability may lead to cardiac complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged sedation and gastrointestinal instability may lead to gastrointestinal complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged sedation and neurological instability may lead to neurological complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with an open abdomen and prolonged sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/87 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera edema and mild icterus in the eyes, normocephalic head, and soft abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole, and has a central venous catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 264 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The patient's kidney function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal wound was closed, but the surgery team does not plan to return to the operating room for closure. Instead, the wound will be managed with a wound vacuum device (woundvac) and allowed to granulate.

The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with a high risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's sedation level is prolonged, which may limit the ability to extubate the patient. The plan is to wean the patient off sedation and switch to a pressure support (PS) ventilator.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Wound infection: The patient's open abdomen and prolonged sedation increase the risk of wound infection.
2. VAP: The patient's respiratory status and prolonged sedation increase the risk of VAP.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's critical illness and prolonged sedation increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's impaired kidney function and prolonged sedation increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and prolonged sedation increase the risk of hepatic failure.
6. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's critical illness and prolonged sedation increase the risk of a prolonged ICU stay."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning.
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate.
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.2.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes, can consider pan-cx today, repeat CXR.
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -TF restarted, high residuals so discontinued overnight
   -Vent wean started, tolerated PSV most of the day, became apneic in
   early morning, switched to MMV which she is tolerating. Sedation weaned
   further overnight.
   -Versed/fentanyl weaned; initially fentanyl down to 150 from 400 but
   patient was tachycardic; was then increased to 200 with some
   improvement in HR; can consider transition to propofol in am
   -Written for fentanyl patch (150mcg) with the idea of weaning fentanyl
   drip tomorrow pm
   -Was a bit tachycardic during the day, increased fentanyl as above and
   gave fluid bolus with increase in UOP and small decrease in HR, overall
   volume up

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy due to a small bowel obstruction (SBO). She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with a side-to-side anastomosis and an open abdomen. The patient has been in the ICU for over 10 days, intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation, which she tolerated throughout the day, and she was switched to MMV due to apneic episodes. Her sedation was weaned, and she is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, with a transaminase level of 67 IU/L. Her coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but her international normalized ratio (INR) is within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include a small bowel perforation, SBO, and a history of DVT. She has an IVC filter in place and is receiving subcutaneous heparin. Her mental status is altered, and she is unable to be assessed at this time. Her hypertension is stable, and she is receiving antihypertensive medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is minimal, and she may require more aggressive ventilation if her condition deteriorates.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and history of liver biopsy may indicate liver damage, which could progress to liver failure if not treated.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may indicate a bleeding disorder, which could increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and IVC filter placement may increase her risk of further thrombotic complications.
6. Anasarca: The patient's fluid overload and low albumin levels may increase her risk of anasarca, which could lead to further complications.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which could progress to transaminitis if not treated.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning.
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate.
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.2.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes, can consider pan-cx today, repeat CXR.
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable
   - Will recheck CBC this am
   - Transfuse for Hct <28
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Leukocytosis improved slightly, Tmax 100.4 yesterday morning, no
   fevers overnight. Was pancultured, all no growth to date. Will follow
   micro results.
   - Pt intubated >10 days, initial concern for VAP given increased
   sputum, low grade temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR
   and clinical status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning.
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate.
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.2.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR clear, clinically and HD stable.
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture if spikes, can consider pan-cx today, repeat CXR.
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable
   - Will recheck CBC this am
   - Transfuse for Hct <28

   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - F/u results of liver biopsy
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy due to a small bowel perforation. She has an open abdomen and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL. Her hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL, and her platelet count is 317 K/uL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 39 U/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 67 U/L.

The patient has been experiencing some complications, including:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation, which has been treated with resection and anastomosis. The abdomen is currently open, and the patient is at risk for peritonitis and sepsis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has mild leukocytosis, which may be due to the surgical trauma or a potential infection.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has slightly elevated LFTs, which may be due to the surgical trauma or a potential liver injury.
4. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which may be due to the surgical trauma, dehydration, or a potential liver injury.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently well-controlled with medication.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has reported altered mental status, which may be due to the surgical trauma, medication, or a potential liver injury.
7. DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which has been treated with heparin and an IVC filter.

The patient's current plan is to continue to monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. She will be weaned off sedation and intubation as tolerated, and her antibiotics will be discontinued as she completes her 10-day course. The patient will also be monitored for signs of infection, including fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical
   hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with
   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring
   24 Hour Events:
   -TF restarted, high residuals so discontinued overnight
   -Vent wean started, tolerated PSV most of the day, became apneic in
   early morning, switched to MMV which she is tolerating. Sedation weaned
   further overnight.
   -Versed/fentanyl weaned; initially fentanyl down to 150 from 400 but
   patient was tachycardic; was then increased to 200 with some
   improvement in HR; can consider transition to propofol in am
   -Written for fentanyl patch (150mcg) with the idea of weaning fentanyl
   drip this pm
   -Was a bit tachycardic during the day, increased fentanyl as above and
   gave fluid bolus with increase in UOP and small decrease in HR, overall
   volume up

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired with an anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and she has a respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 41.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 317 K/uL. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 67 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 39 IU/L. Her albumin level is 2.2 g/dL, and her lactate level is 2.3 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, anemia, and a history of liver biopsy. She has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and she has a respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 41, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of small bowel perforation, which may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a history of liver biopsy, which may indicate hepatic failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may indicate anemia.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving anticoagulation therapy.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may indicate hypertension.
7. Sedation: The patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days, which may increase her risk of developing sedation-related complications.
8. FEN: The patient is receiving TPN, which may increase her risk of developing fatty liver disease.
9. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy or other causes.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including her white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and liver function tests, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
3. Continue to provide anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her antihypertensive medications as needed.
5. Continue to provide sedation and analgesia as needed to manage the patient's pain and discomfort.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her TPN regimen as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a liver specialist to further evaluate the patient's liver function and potential liver failure.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to further evaluate the patient's kidney function and potential kidney failure.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her sedation regimen as needed to manage her altered mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of a small bowel obstruction (SBO) followed by fascial closure and open abdomen. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and septic shock. She is ventilator-dependent and has a history of SBO perforation, anemia, and leukocytosis. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and multiple peripheral IV lines.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 408 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. She has a high respiratory support index (RSBI) of 41 and a plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. Her abdominal wound is open, and she has a wound vacuum in place.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. She has a history of septic shock and has received antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and is at risk of developing further sepsis or septic shock.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
5. Abdominal wound complications: The patient's open abdominal wound is at risk of developing complications such as wound infection, dehiscence, or evisceration.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and further complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate underlying cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and decreased muscle tone may indicate underlying neurological complications such as sepsis-related encephalopathy or neuromuscular weakness.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal status. Additionally, it is crucial to address her nutritional needs, anemia, and leukocytosis to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory failure. She has a history of pelvic mass, TAH/BSO, and SBO, and has undergone fascial closure with an open abdomen. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on continuous sedation for over 10 days.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 146/78 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL and a hematocrit of 27.5%. Her white blood cell count is 17.9 K/uL, and her platelet count is 244 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT level of 39 IU/L and an AST level of 67 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show a non-specific liver biopsy and a CXR that is normal.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator-dependent and is on MMV.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and the source is unclear. Cultures have been obtained and are pending.
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving TPN and is able to attempt TF trials.
* Bowel perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is being managed with wound vac changes, and there are no plans for future surgery.
* Mental status: The patient is not following commands, but has been on continuous sedation for over 10 days. The plan is to discontinue benzodiazepine infusions and monitor the patient's mental status.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and the cause is unclear. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's hemoglobin level.
* DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and the plan is to discuss starting heparin therapy with the surgery team.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's increasing white blood cell count and unclear source of infection may indicate the development of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's ventilator dependence and low lung compliance may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may increase the risk of anemia, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.
* DVT: The patient's IVC filter and low platelet count may increase the risk of DVT.
* Mental status changes: The patient's prolonged sedation and anemia may increase the risk of mental status changes, such as confusion or agitation.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored and that her treatment plan be adjusted as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy due to a pelvic mass. She developed a small bowel perforation and was taken to the operating room (OR) for resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She has been in the ICU for monitoring and management of her condition.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* She is intubated and on minimal ventilator support.
* She is sedated and unable to follow commands.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 169/99 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.
* Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.
* She has an open abdomen and is at risk for surgical site infections.
* She has an IVC filter in place due to a known DVT.
* She is receiving TPN and has a fentanyl patch to manage her pain.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgery make her at risk for surgical site infections, which could lead to sepsis.
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for >10 days, which increases her risk for VAP.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent surgery make her at risk for bleeding.
* DVT: The patient has a known DVT and is at risk for further clotting.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and recent liver biopsy suggest potential liver dysfunction.
* Neurological impairment: The patient's altered mental status and flaccid extremities suggest potential neurological impairment.
* Hypertension: The patient's recent hypertension and current normotensive status make her at risk for hypertension-related complications.
* Sedation withdrawal: The patient's prolonged sedation and potential for sedation withdrawal syndrome are concerns.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient will continue to be monitored closely for signs of sepsis, VAP, bleeding, and DVT.
* Her sedation will be weaned as tolerated, and she will be extubated when able.
* Her pain will be managed with a fentanyl patch and prn versed as needed.
* Her anemia will be monitored, and transfusions will be given as necessary.
* Her liver enzymes will be closely monitored for signs of liver dysfunction.
* Her neurological status will be re-evaluated regularly to assess for signs of improvement or deterioration.
* Her hypertension will be monitored, and antihypertensive medications will be adjusted as necessary.
* Her sedation withdrawal syndrome will be closely monitored for signs of withdrawal."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today.
   # Respiratory - On minimal vent support settings. Pt intubated >10
   days, initial concern for VAP given increased sputum, low grade
   temperature and increased leukocytosis; however, CXR and clinical
   status not concerning for VAP at this point.
   - On CPAP/PSV ventillation which she tolerated throughout the day.
   Required MMV given some apneic episodes.
   - Still sedated, but fentanyl/versed weaning
   - CXR today to evaluate for evolving infiltrate
   - Started on fentanyl patch to help decrease drip rate
   - Given no further OR, will wean as tolerated with the plan to extubate
   when able.
   # Leukocytosis - Increased today. Discontinued antibiotics yestereday
   as patient completed 10 day course. CXR not remarkable to VAP
   yesterday, but is high on the differential. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.3.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and perforation. She has an open abdomen and is currently in the ICU for monitoring. The patient has been intubated for over 10 days and has been sedated, with minimal weaning of sedatives. She has been experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, and increased leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory: The patient's prolonged intubation and sedation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The CXR today will help evaluate for evolving infiltrate.
2. Infection: The patient's increased leukocytosis and low-grade temperature suggest the possibility of infection. The pan-culture today and with spikes will help identify the source of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is down slightly, and there is no clear source of bleeding. The patient will need to be transfused for HD instability or acute drop.
4. Anasarca: The patient's significant improvement in anasarca may be due to IVFs, deconditioning, and low albumin. The patient's I/O goals will need to be closely monitored.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is unclear in etiology, and the patient will need to be monitored for any changes.
6. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and she will need to be discussed with surgery today regarding anticoagulation timeline.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy or other causes. The patient will need to be re-evaluated once she is extubated and able to follow commands.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is stable, and she will need to be monitored for any changes.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and CXR to evaluate for evolving infiltrate.
2. Perform pan-culture today and with spikes to identify the source of infection.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anasarca and I/O goals.
5. Monitor the patient's transaminitis and liver function tests.
6. Discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today regarding DVT.
7. Re-evaluate the patient's altered mental status once she is extubated and able to follow commands.
8. Monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy due to a small bowel obstruction (SBO). She recently developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with a side-side anastomosis and an open abdomen.
* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and management of her condition.
* She has a history of leukocytosis, which is currently decreasing. Her white blood cell count is elevated, but she has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and does not have any clear source of infection.
* The patient has nausea and vomiting, which may be related to ileus, prolonged fentanyl use, or medication reactions. She is receiving antiemetic medication and IV fluids to manage her symptoms.
* She has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL. Her hematocrit is stable at 26%, and she is being monitored for signs of bleeding or instability.
* The patient has anasarca, which is improving with IV fluids and deconditioning. She is still unable to tolerate tube feedings due to high residuals.
* She has transaminitis, which is resolving. Her liver enzymes are decreasing, and she is being monitored for signs of liver damage.
* The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being maintained on heparin therapy. She has an IVC filter in place.
* She has hypertension, which is being managed with IV hydralazine. She is also receiving antihypertensive medication at home.
* The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for signs of infection or complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's open abdomen and history of small bowel perforation.
* Respiratory failure due to her ileus and potential for aspiration.
* Cardiac complications due to her hypertension and potential for cardiac strain.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to her anemia and potential for bleeding.
* Liver damage or failure due to her transaminitis and potential for liver damage.
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to her history of DVT and anticoagulation therapy.
* Infection or sepsis due to her open abdomen and potential for bacterial contamination.
* Nutritional deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances due to her ileus and potential for malabsorption.

I recommend that the patient be closely monitored for any signs of complications or deterioration in her condition, and that her treatment plan be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory
Extubated this morning. Sating well on 2L nasal
   cannula.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC remains elevated, decreased from yesterday.
   Discontinued antibiotics yestereday as patient completed 10 day course.
   Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious for VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.9.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today showed no signs of focal
   infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting.  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF for tonight while vomiting
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF for tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am,
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 26
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today.
   -Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.  Resolving.
   -avoid hepatotoxins
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Had been normotensive throughout stay.  Now
   hypertensive up to 170/100s. On three-drug antihypertensive regimen at
   home.  Will avoid PO agents due to ileus.
   -Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   -transition back to home meds when able to tolerate PO medications
   -continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF advance while vomiting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ileus resolving and HCT stable 24 hours.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a complex medical history, including a recent small bowel perforation and an open abdomen. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone multiple surgeries.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was extubated this morning and is currently receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the patient is receiving antihypertensive medication. The patient's cardiac rhythm is normal.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which is likely related to the patient's recent surgery and prolonged use of fentanyl. The patient's bowel sounds are present, and the patient is passing gas.
* Hepatic: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's liver biopsy showed acute cholestatic liver injury, which may be secondary to acute extra-hepatic biliary obstruction, drug effect, or ascending cholangitis.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the patient's platelet count is normal.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is normal.
* Neurological: The patient is awake and oriented, with normal strength and reflexes.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure if the patient's ileus persists or if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
* Sepsis: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient may be at risk for hepatic failure if the patient's liver disease progresses.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the patient may be at risk for renal failure if the patient's kidney function deteriorates further.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC filter in place, and the patient may be at risk for DVT if the patient's anticoagulation therapy is not adequate.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

* Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and blood pressure to prevent respiratory failure and hypertension.
* Administration of antihypertensive medication to control the patient's blood pressure.
* Monitoring of the patient's liver function tests and bilirubin levels to detect any changes in the patient's liver function.
* Administration of anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and pulmonary embolism.
* Monitoring of the patient's creatinine level to detect any changes in the patient's kidney function.
* Administration of antibiotics to prevent sepsis and other infections.
* Monitoring of the patient's neurological status to detect any changes in the patient's mental status or strength.
* Administration of pain medication to control the patient's pain and discomfort.
* Monitoring of the patient's gastrointestinal status to detect any changes in the patient's bowel habits or nausea and vomiting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel perforation,
   had been unable to close abdomen due to significant edema.  Now s/p
   fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for closure.  Abdomen will
   close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory
Extubated this morning. Sating well on 2L nasal
   cannula.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC remains elevated, decreased from yesterday.
   Discontinued antibiotics yestereday as patient completed 10 day course.
   Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious for VAP. HD
   stable. Low grade temperature to 100.9.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today showed no signs of focal
   infiltrate
   - Add on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Pan-culture today and with spikes
   # Anemia: Hct down slightly this am. No clear source of bleeding.
   Decreased after OR, then bumped appropriately with 2 units. Has been HD
   stable. [**Month (only) 60**] be dilutional as patient with less UOP and less
   hemoconcentrated as she is off lasix gtt and overall I/O positive.
   - Rechecked CBC and hct stable at 27
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anasarca
 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Downtrending/stable today. Unclear etiology for patient's
   transaminitis.  Patient is status post liver biopsy on [**2180-3-5**].
   - Had stopped following as levels were decreasing; however, with some
   evidence of ?scleral icterus they were found to be slightly increased
   (T. bili, ALP and LDH).  Can continue to monitor.
   - Results of liver biopsy showing non-specific process
   - Hep A, B, C negative.  HepBsAB +
   - Alpha 1 antitrypsin - 233 (slightly elevated)- difficult to interpret
   in this setting.  Ceruloplasmin normal.
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Will discuss anticoagulation timeline with surgery today as patient
   has known DVT and will need anticoagulation
   # Altered Mental Status
   Unable to assess at this point.  Patient reportedly had altered mental
   status earlier this admission, thought possibly secondary to hepatic
   encephalopathy.  At this time she is on minimal sedation and still
   unable to follow commands.  Also quite flaccid on exam with no movement
   in extremities
   -Will re-evaluate once patient is s/p return to the OR after closure
   and able to be extubated
   - Will continue to monitor status over next few days and re-evaluate if
   still no purposeful movement or unable to follow commands off sedation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Previously hypertensive, but now normotensive
   - Con
t to hold HTN medications and monitor VS, can consider adding
   back if needed today.
   # Sedation: Patient has been sedated and intubated for >10 days.  Given
   no further return to OR, will begin wean as above, maintaining fentanyl
   levels to ensure pain control.
   - On fentanyl patch to wean drip, now down from 400mcg gtt to 50 with
   150 mcg patch.
   - Will turn off versed as on minimal dose with agitation or signs of
   discomfort. Will give prn versed for agitation or signs of benzo
   withdrawal
   # FEN: On TPN, restarting trophic tube feeds as above, bowel regimen
   including colace and senna, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a hysterectomy and resection with open abdomen due to bowel perforation. She was extubated this morning and is receiving minimal oxygen via nasal cannula. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and her pain appears to be controlled with a fentanyl patch. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a trend of decreasing hemoglobin levels. Her blood pressure is increasing, and she will start hydralazine to control it. She has an IVC filter in place and is at risk for DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require re-intubation if her oxygen requirements increase.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's IVC filter and history of open abdomen surgery make her at risk for DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
5. Hypertension: The patient's increasing blood pressure may require further medication and monitoring to prevent complications such as stroke and cardiac arrest.
6. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hemoglobin levels may require transfusion to prevent complications such as organ failure and death.
7. Infection: The patient's open abdomen and history of bowel perforation make her at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and death.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider re-intubation if necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and fever to assess for sepsis.
3. Consider inserting a nasogastric tube to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Monitor the patient's IVC filter and anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medication as necessary to prevent complications.
6. Consider transfusing the patient with packed red blood cells to prevent anemia.
7. Monitor the patient's wound and abdomen for signs of infection and take prompt action if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy complicated by small bowel obstruction (SBO) and perforation, followed by resection and colostomy. She has an open abdominal wound and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute (104-138)
* Blood pressure: 150/99 mmHg (112-170/74-107 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (9-21)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmurs or rubs
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present, wound vac with dressing in place
* Extremities: Right and left radial and digital pulses present, no cyanosis or clubbing
* Neurological: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to voice and movement

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.0-17.9 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 233-354 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26-30.9 mmol/L
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103-157 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L

The patient has been extubated and is receiving minimal oxygen via nasal cannula. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which has led to the placement of a nasogastric tube. Her pain appears to be controlled with a fentanyl patch.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require reintubation if her oxygen requirements increase.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of perforation and open abdominal wound, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but her anticoagulation status is unclear, and she may be at risk for developing a DVT.
* HTN: The patient's blood pressure is increasing, which may require further management.

Based on the patient's current status, I recommend:

* Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygen requirements
* Continued antibiotic therapy for SBO and perforation
* Management of her pain and nausea
* Regular assessment of her hemodynamic status and bleeding risk
* Review of her anticoagulation status and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT prevention
* Close monitoring of her laboratory results, particularly her white blood cell count and platelet count."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Intra-abdominal pathology: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation and anastomosis, which may lead to ongoing intra-abdominal complications such as abscesses, fistulas, or bowel obstruction.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for 10 days, but the white blood cell count remains elevated, suggesting ongoing infection. The presence of peritoneal fluid with Candida albicans and the patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate sepsis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is not responsive to fluid boluses and may be due to underlying cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation or pulmonary embolism. The use of benzodiazepines may exacerbate the tachycardia.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be related to the benzodiazepines, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying medical conditions.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to ileus, surgical manipulation, or medication side effects. The use of antiemetics and holding tube feedings may help manage these symptoms.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to underlying medical conditions such as kidney disease, sleep apnea, or medication side effects. The use of IV hydralazine may help manage blood pressure.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic blood loss, malnutrition, or underlying medical conditions such as kidney disease.
8. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may be due to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying medical conditions such as heart failure or liver disease.
9. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be due to systemic processes such as sepsis, hypotension, or drug effects.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further clotting complications. The use of heparin and an IVC filter may help manage this risk.

The patient's current condition is unstable, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and optimize outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today

   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to

   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation

   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function

   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation and was taken to the operating room for resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen.

The patient is currently extubated and experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, confusion, and tremulousness. She is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, likely due to ileus or a reaction to medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Intra-abdominal infection: Given the patient's history of small bowel perforation and open abdomen, there is a risk of intra-abdominal infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of respiratory failure, which could lead to hypoxemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's confusion and tremulousness may be indicative of delirium, which could lead to disorientation, agitation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences further bleeding or if her underlying condition is not adequately treated.
6. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and the presence of an IVC filter suggest the possibility of DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not adequately treated, which could lead to cardiovascular complications.
8. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen if not adequately treated, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
2. Administer antibiotics as necessary to prevent and treat potential infections.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and provide sedation as necessary to manage delirium.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and provide blood transfusions as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's DVT and provide anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hypertension and provide antihypertensive therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nausea and vomiting and provide antiemetic therapy as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications due to her underlying condition and current treatment. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Will touch base with gyn onc attending to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory
Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics
   yestereday as patient completed 10 day course. Oxgenating well, no
   increased sputum production suspicious for VAP. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.9.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR today showed no signs of focal
   infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting.  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.
   - CIWA scale
   - Consider CTA to rule out PE if no improvement on benzos (ativan vs
   valium)
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop

 Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased yesterday, will add on LFTs today.
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.  Resolving.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Mentioned anticoagulation to [**Doctor First Name 458**] this am, they will discuss with
   attending and get back to us regarding therapeutic anticoagulation
   # Hypertension - Stable.  Had been normotensive throughout stay.  Now
   hypertensive up to 170/100s. On three-drug antihypertensive regimen at
   home.  Will avoid PO agents due to ileus.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - transition back to home meds when able to tolerate PO medications
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF advance while vomiting.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) post-operatively. She had a recent small bowel perforation and underwent resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen. She was unable to close the abdomen due to significant edema and was left with an open abdomen. The patient was extubated yesterday and remains tachycardic with a heart rate of 135 bpm. She has been vomiting throughout the day and has not responded to fluid boluses. Her blood pressure is stable, but she is hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 155/87 mmHg. She has a white blood cell count of 17.9 K/uL and is at risk for sepsis. She has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and tremors, which may be related to benzodiazepine withdrawal or other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of SBO and recent small bowel perforation, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Benzo withdrawal: The patient's symptoms of tremors, delirium, and hypertension may be related to benzodiazepine withdrawal.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she has a history of hypertension, which may worsen her condition.
4. Volume depletion: The patient has been vomiting and has not responded to fluid boluses, which may indicate volume depletion.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated yesterday, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying medical condition and recent surgery.
6. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but she may still be at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical condition.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she may be at risk for developing anemia due to her underlying medical condition and recent blood loss.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
9. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which may be related to her underlying medical condition and recent surgery.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of SBO and recent small bowel perforation, which increases her risk of developing infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Will touch base with gyn onc attending to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status. Has been slightly tachycardic with
   decreased UOP as compared to prior, now slightly volume up. Goal I/O
   even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics
   yestereday as patient completed 10 day course. Oxgenating well, no
   increased sputum production suspicious for VAP. HD stable. Low grade
   temperature to 100.9.
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.
   - CIWA scale
   - Consider CTA to rule out PE if no improvement on benzos (ativan vs
   valium)
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased yesterday, will add on LFTs today.
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.  Resolving.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Mentioned anticoagulation to [**Doctor First Name 458**] this am, they will discuss with
   attending and get back to us regarding therapeutic anticoagulation
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Had been normotensive throughout stay.  Now
   hypertensive up to 170/100s. On three-drug antihypertensive regimen at
   home.  Will avoid PO agents due to ileus.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - transition back to home meds when able to tolerate PO medications
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF advance while vomiting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis. The patient has an open abdomen and is being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* She is extubated and breathing on 2L nasal cannula.
* She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which is likely due to ileus, prolonged fentanyl use, and surgical manipulation.
* She has a tachycardia that is not responsive to fluid boluses, and her urine output is still adequate.
* She has a tremor and delirium, which may be consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal.
* She has anemia, which is being monitored, and her hemoglobin level is stable.
* She has anasarca, which is improving, and her albumin level is low.
* She has transaminitis, which is resolving, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored.
* She has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) filter in place, and she is being treated with subcutaneous heparin.
* She has hypertension, which is being treated with IV hydralazine, and she is being monitored for signs of hypovolemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the open abdomen and the presence of a small bowel perforation.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachycardia and hyperventilation.
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension.
* Renal failure due to the patient's hypovolemia and decreased urine output.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's anemia and transaminitis.
* Pulmonary embolism due to the patient's DVT filter and the presence of a central venous catheter.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent GIST tumor resection, resulting in small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent resection/colostomy with an open abdominal wound. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing complications.

Key findings and concerns include:

1. Bowel perforation: The patient's SBO perforation is a critical concern, as it may lead to sepsis, shock, and multi-organ failure.
2. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has changed, with confusion and agitation, which may be related to SBO perforation, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or other underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a small oxygen requirement after extubation.
4. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, and the plan is to restart heparin prophylaxis if the CT abdomen is negative.
5. Hypertension: The patient is being treated with hydralazine IV for hypertension.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing persistent N/V, which may be related to the SBO perforation or other underlying conditions.
7. Abdominal wound: The patient has an open abdominal wound, which requires ongoing care and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the SBO perforation and open abdominal wound.
2. Shock: The patient's SBO perforation and ongoing fluid losses may lead to shock.
3. Multi-organ failure: The patient's compromised respiratory and cardiovascular status, combined with the SBO perforation, may lead to multi-organ failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration may occur.
5. DVT/PE: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but there is still a risk of developing DVT or PE.
6. Infection: The patient's open abdominal wound and SBO perforation make her prone to infection.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's SBO perforation and ongoing bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

To address these concerns and potential complications, the plan includes:

1. CTA/CT abdomen to evaluate for PE/SBO perforation.
2. Switch to valium due to its longer half-life to address possible benzodiazepine withdrawal.
3. Continue NGT and hold enteral feeds due to N/V.
4. Restart heparin prophylaxis if CT abdomen is negative.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Manage the patient's hypertension with hydralazine IV.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal wound and provide ongoing care and monitoring.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her critical illness and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent resection of a GIST tumor and developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) with perforation, followed by resection and colostomy with an open abdominal wound. The patient was extubated yesterday and remains tachycardic and has persistent nausea and vomiting.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's open abdominal wound and SBO perforation increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and respiratory distress may indicate respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's SBO and potential respiratory infections.
3. Dehydration: The patient's persistent nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, which can further exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of the patient's open abdominal wound.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC filter in place, which reduces the risk of DVT, but the patient's prolonged immobility and SBO may still increase the risk of DVT.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
8. Wound infection: The patient's open abdominal wound is at risk of developing an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's SBO and perforation increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these complications effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent resection of a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) and subsequently developed Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) and perfusion. She has undergone resection and colostomy with an open abdominal wound.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* She is extubated but remains tachycardic and has persistent nausea and vomiting.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/98 mmHg.
* She has a central venous catheter and is receiving hydration, antibiotics, and other medications as needed.
* She has a nasogastric tube and is not receiving enteral feeds.
* Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.
* She has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving hydralazine IV.
* She has a code status of full code and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of SBO and perfusion, she is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and persistent nausea and vomiting may indicate respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of SBO and perfusion increases her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC filter in place, but she is still at risk for developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status changes may be related to her underlying condition or medication side effects, but they can also be a sign of neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema.
6. Wound complications: The patient's open abdominal wound is at risk for infection, dehiscence, and other complications, which can lead to prolonged hospitalization and increased morbidity.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Intra-abdominal pathology: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation, and the CT scan shows multiple areas of small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity. This could lead to further complications such as sepsis, abscesses, or perforation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is not responding to IV fluids and may be related to benzo withdrawal, PE, or other abdominal events. Further evaluation with CTA and abdominal CT is necessary to rule out PE and perforation as sources of tachycardia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count remains elevated, and antibiotics have been discontinued after a 10-day course. This may indicate a persistent infection or inflammation.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to ileus, SBO, or reaction to medications, particularly opiates.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but transfusion may be necessary for HD instability or acute drop.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly increased, which may be related to a systemic process such as sepsis, hypotension, or drug effect.
7. DVT: The patient has a known DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events. Anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent further thrombosis.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but hypertension may be related to medication or underlying medical conditions. IV hydralazine may be necessary to control blood pressure.
9. Respiratory issues: The patient is extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen, but may be at risk for respiratory complications such as VAP.
10. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a significant fluid imbalance, with a total fluid input of 2,984 mL and a total fluid output of 2,488 mL. This may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance or cardiac issues.

The patient's condition is complex, and further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Intra-abdominal pathology: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation and has undergone multiple surgeries. The recent spike in temperature and tachycardia may indicate an underlying intra-abdominal infection or perforation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was recently extubated, but the presence of leukocytosis and low-grade fever may indicate a risk for VAP.
3. Benzo withdrawal: The patient has been receiving benzodiazepines and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including tremors and delirium.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient has an IVC filter in place, the presence of tachycardia and hypotension may indicate a PE.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis, which may be related to systemic processes such as sepsis, hypotension, or drug effects.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to blood loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, or chronic disease.
7. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be related to underlying medical conditions or medication use.
8. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and the presence of fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis may indicate a recurrence.
9. Ileus: The patient has ileus, which may be related to surgical manipulation, medication use, or underlying medical conditions.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, which may indicate a risk for malnutrition.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications, including:

* Further evaluation of the patient's abdominal pathology, including CT scans and peritoneal fluid cultures.
* Management of the patient's tachycardia, including the use of benzodiazepines and anticoagulation therapy.
* Monitoring of the patient's liver function and transaminitis.
* Management of the patient's hypertension, including the use of IV hydralazine and antihypertensive medications.
* Monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and gastrointestinal function.
* Prevention of VAP and other respiratory complications.
* Management of the patient's anemia and blood loss.
* Monitoring of the patient's overall medical condition and response to treatment."

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and GIST tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid
   collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior pararenal
   space,
   within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical resection site at
   the base
   of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its
   main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was
   limited
   due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density meaterial around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**2180-3-13**] CTA CHEST and CT ABDOMEN:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and GIST tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid
   collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior pararenal
   space,
   within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical resection site at
   the base
   of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its
   main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was
   limited
   due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density meaterial around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.

   [**2180-3-13**] CTA CHEST and CT ABDOMEN:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and GIST tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid
   collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior pararenal
   space,
   within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical resection site at
   the base
   of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its
   main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism was
   limited
   due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density meaterial around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated but continues to have low
   grade temps
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR.  CT
   abdomen with leak concerning for small bowel perf. Also concerning for
   small abscesses per radiology read.
   - hold off on tube feeds for now.  Per surgery, will start cipro/flagyl
   for bowel perf, low temps, elevated WBC (now stable)
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - heme/onc consult for GIST
   - Goal I/O even today
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. CXR clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course.
   - start cipro/flagyl for suspected small bowel perf based on CT scan.
   Hold tube feeds.  Likely abdominal (abscess, perf) source of fever and
   leukocytosis
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while there is perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   - CIWA scale with valium.  Delerium improving but continues to be
   tachycardic
   - CTA without evidence of PE
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output- guaiac positive.  But hct stable
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement.
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   # Transaminitis
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT- new LUE swelling
   - will get LUE US to eval for DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - will hold of hep gtt given ? perf and guaiac positive stools
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:  ICU care while evaluating persistent tachycardia/fevers
   and now new probably perforation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with subsequent small bowel perforation and resection, resulting in an open abdomen. The patient has been experiencing persistent tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis, which has led to concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, and open abdomen increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Small bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel perforation can lead to peritonitis, abscesses, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Anastomotic leak: The patient's recent small bowel resection and anastomosis increase the risk of anastomotic leak, which can lead to peritonitis, abscesses, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Dehydration: The patient's persistent tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis can lead to dehydration, which can exacerbate the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent extubation and persistent tachycardia increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's persistent tachycardia can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate tube feeds and ongoing malnutrition increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.
8. Wound complications: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgical interventions increase the risk of wound complications, such as wound infection, dehiscence, and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's recent surgery and immobility increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring, aggressive management of sepsis, and prompt intervention to address any complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b
   SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB
   resection and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring given open abdomen now extubated.
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/GIST: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.   Patient had
   apparently had undetected perforation for several days when she
   initially presented. Now with tachycardia (see below), concern for
   other abdominal event.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery, will be changed today
   - Dc'd vanco/pip-tazo/fluc as patient has completed 10 day course.
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - CT abdomen with contrast today to evaluate for possible perforation
   given current clinical status
   - Will touch base with heme/onc tomorrow to determine next
   step/prognosis/treatment plan
   - Continue to follow volume status.
   - Goal I/O even today. Will bolus for tachycardia, hypotension
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. Sating well on 2L nasal cannula.  CXR
   clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated. Discontinued antibiotics after 10
   day course. Oxgenating well, no increased sputum production suspicious
   for VAP. HD stable. Still with low grade temperature to 100.  Concern
   as above for intra-abdominal pathology.
   - CT abdomen as above
   - No clear source of infection, CXR showed no signs of focal infiltrate
   - No left shift on differential
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   #Nausea/vomiting:  Ddx includes ileus/SBO, pt is passing gas and has
   bowel sounds.  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   -NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   -hold TF while vomiting and while there is surgical concern for
   perforation
   -antiemetics PRN
   -bolus IVF prn if appears dry [**12-25**] hypovolemia
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   Other possible etiology is PE, though patient has been normotensive and
   has IVC filter in place.  However, she has not been adequately
   anticoagulated for her DVT.
   - CIWA scale with valium, will load her this morning and assess for
   improvement.
   - Will get CTA along with abdominal CT as above to rule out PE and
   perforation as sources of tachycardia
   # Anemia: Hct stable this am
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output
   - Continue to monitor
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   - Patient still unable to tolerate TFs given high residuals.  Will
   continue to re-try daily until return of bowel function
   # Transaminitis
   - Slightly increased over the last few days
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect.
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend
   # DVT
   Patient was previously maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter
   placed in the setting of emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - After discussion with surgery, will start patient on heparin gtt once
   perforation ruled out by CT today for therapeutic anticoagulation given
   known DVT.
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to a small bowel perforation and subsequent open abdomen. She has a history of pelvic mass and has undergone resection and colostomy. The patient has been unable to close her abdomen due to significant edema and has undergone fascial closure in the operating room.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever (101.3°F) with a spike at 7:30 pm
* Tachycardia (120 bpm) unresponsive to IV fluids
* Hypertension (153/100 mmHg)
* Leukocytosis (WBC count of 547 K/uL) with an elevated neutrophil count
* Anasarca (significant improvement)
* Transaminitis (slightly increased liver enzymes)
* DVT (known DVT with an IVC filter in place)
* Hypertension (stable on three-drug antihypertensive regimen)

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated WBC count
* Elevated neutrophil count
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Normal kidney function (Cr 0.4 mg/dL)
* Normal electrolyte levels (Na 139 mEq/L, K 26.0 mmol/L, Cl 106 mEq/L)

The patient's medical history includes:

* Supracervical hysterectomy and BSO
* Small bowel perforation and subsequent open abdomen
* DVT with an IVC filter in place

The patient's current medications include:

* IV fluids (TPN with lipids)
* Antibiotics (Vanco/pip-tazo/fluc) discontinued after 10-day course
* Anticoagulation therapy (SC heparin) with an IVC filter in place
* Antiemetics (PRN)
* Sedatives (CIWA scale with valium)
* Antihypertensive medications (IV hydralazine Q6)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to the open abdomen and potential intra-abdominal infection
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) despite having an IVC filter in place
* Volume depletion due to inadequate fluid resuscitation
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypertension and tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or bowel obstruction
* Liver dysfunction due to transaminitis
* Kidney dysfunction due to inadequate hydration

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of deterioration and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent resection of a GIST tumor and developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) with subsequent resection and colostomy. She has an open abdominal wound and has been experiencing mental status changes, including delirium, since extubation. The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 101.3°F and has developed multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity, as seen on CT abdomen.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management medications, and anti-anxiety medications. She has also been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has a central venous catheter (CVC) in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 126 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 147/92 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Her blood cultures are pending.

The patient's imaging studies, including CT abdomen and USG, show no evidence of stones or other abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Tachycardia and fever: The patient's tachycardia and fever are likely due to her underlying infection and may be related to the development of multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity.
2. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes, including delirium, are likely related to her underlying infection and may be exacerbated by her withdrawal from benzodiazepines.
3. SBO perf: The patient's SBO perf is likely related to her underlying condition and may be exacerbated by her mental status changes.
4. DVT: The patient's DVT is likely related to her underlying condition and may be exacerbated by her immobility and risk factors.
5. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is likely related to her underlying condition and may be exacerbated by her mental status changes and use of medications.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's underlying infection and development of multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity put her at risk for sepsis.
2. Organ failure: The patient's underlying condition and use of medications may put her at risk for organ failure, including respiratory failure and cardiac failure.
3. DVT: The patient's DVT is a potential complication of her underlying condition and may lead to pulmonary embolism.
4. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is a potential complication of her underlying condition and may lead to hemorrhagic shock.
5. Infection: The patient's underlying infection and development of multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity put her at risk for further infection.

The patient's care plan should include:

1. Antibiotics: The patient should continue to receive antibiotics to treat her underlying infection.
2. Pain management: The patient should receive pain management medications to manage her discomfort and pain.
3. Anti-anxiety medications: The patient should receive anti-anxiety medications to manage her anxiety and agitation.
4. TPN: The patient should continue to receive TPN with lipids to provide her with adequate nutrition.
5. CVC: The patient's CVC should be removed and replaced with a PICC line if possible.
6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient should receive DVT prophylaxis, including boots and SQ UF heparin, to prevent the development of DVT.
7. GI bleed management: The patient's GI bleed should be managed with fluids and medications as needed.
8. Infection control: The patient's underlying infection and development of multiple small abscesses in the peritoneal cavity should be managed with infection control measures, including antibiotics and surgical drainage."

   hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with
   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring, now extubated with delirium.
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN
   - No physical therapy per PT at this time as surgery does not want

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical

   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring, now extubated with delirium.
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by a small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation and underwent resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and has been extubated.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Low-grade fever
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC)
* Tachycardia
* Hypertension
* Anemia
* Anasarca (edema)
* Transaminitis (liver enzyme elevation)
* DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is not present, but there is new swelling in the left upper extremity (LUE) without evidence of DVT on ultrasound

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated WBC count (13.6-17.9 x 10^9/L)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST 86/104 IU/L)
* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos 505 IU/L)
* Elevated bilirubin (2.7 mg/dL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 342 IU/L)
* Elevated calcium (7.9 mg/dL)
* Elevated magnesium (1.9 mg/dL)
* Elevated phosphate (3.9 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CTA (computed tomography angiography) without evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE)
* CT abdomen with leak concerning for small bowel perforation and small abscesses
* Small left pleural effusion

The patient's plan includes:

* Holding off on tube feeds for now due to small bowel perforation
* Starting vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for bowel perforation and low-grade fever
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Continuing to monitor WBC count and liver enzymes
* Transfusing for anemia if necessary
* Monitoring for signs of DVT and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Continuing to monitor blood pressure and adjusting antihypertensive therapy as necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to bowel perforation and infection
* Organ failure (e.g., respiratory, cardiac, renal) due to prolonged ICU stay and underlying medical conditions
* Wound infection or dehiscence due to open abdomen and surgical manipulation
* DVT or pulmonary embolism despite prophylactic measures
* Hypertensive crisis or cardiac arrhythmias due to uncontrolled hypertension
* Liver failure or acute kidney injury due to ongoing liver enzyme elevation and potential medication toxicity
* Malnutrition or electrolyte imbalance due to prolonged fasting and TPN dependence"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post TAH-BSO and [**Month/Day/Year **] tumor removal , there are now multiple
   fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity-in the left anterior
   pararenal space, within the root of the mesentry and in the surgical
   resection site at the base of the bladder.
   2. No pulmonary embolism is noted within the main pulmonary artery and
   its main branches. The evaluation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
   was limited due to motion and poor bolus.
   3.High density material around the liver was not present on prior
   studies and
   raises the possiblity of leak.
   4. Small left pleural effusion.
   Microbiology: [**3-13**] C. Diff negative

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo F with [**Month/Year (2) **] s/p supracervical hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p
   resection and colostomy now with recent SB perforation s/p SB resection
   and side-side anastomosis with open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring
   given open abdomen now extubated but continues to have low grade temps
   # Small bowel perforation s/p anastomosis from small bowel
   perforation/[**Hospital Unit Name **]: Had been unable to close abdomen due to significant
   edema.  Now s/p fascial closure in the OR, no further plans for
   closure.  Abdomen will close by secondary intention.
   - Appreciate OB-gyn and general surgery recs- no further OR.  CT
   abdomen with leak concerning for small bowel perf. Also concerning for
   small abscesses per radiology read.
   - Hold off on tube feeds for now.  Per surgery, started on vanc/zosyn
   for bowel perf, low temps, elevated WBC. No plans for debridement
   - Vanc/zosyn as above
   - Vac change q3 days per surgery
   - Peritoneal fluid with c.albicans, no other positive cx data
   - Heme/onc consult for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] be staffed today
   - Goal I/O even
   # Respiratory: Extubated [**2180-3-12**]. CXR clear, no sputum production.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC remains elevated, trending down slightly.
   Discontinued antibiotics after 10 day course, restarted vanc/zosyn
   [**2180-3-14**] as above.
   - Likely abdominal (abscess, perf) source of fever and leukocytosis, ?
   CVL as source, though no positive blood cultures
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   - Will attempt to have PICC placed today and remove line, will send for
   culture once removed
   # Nausea/vomiting:  Resolved.  Likely due to component of ileus in
   setting of prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may
   be rxn to meds, esp opiates.  Tolerated tube feeds yesterday until
   stopped due to question of perf, now tolerating NGT to gravity
   - NGT in place, continue trial to gravity and consider removal later
   today or tomorrow if no further nausea
   - Hold TF while there is perforation
   - Antiemetics PRN
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, concern over benzo withdrawal. Patient was
   loaded with valium with little improvement. CIWA has been 0-1 for the
   last 24 hours and delirium improved.
    - Can dc CIWA scale today as no further evidence of withdrawal.
    - CTA without evidence of PE
   - Patient appears to be normovolemic, not complaining of any pain, no
   other obvious cause for sinus tachycardia
   - Per surgery request, patient started on IV lopressor q4H with holding
   parameters today, will continue to reevaluate and discontinue as able
   # Anemia: Hct stable over last several days.
   - Transfuse for HD instability or acute drop
   - Guaiac any ostomy output- guaiac positive.  But hct stable
   - Continue to monitor Hct qday unless acute HD change
   - Keep active type and screen
   # Anasarca: Significant improvement.
   - Likely from IVFs, deconditioning, low albumin
   - I/O goals as above.
   # Transaminitis
   - Liver path most c/w systemic process such as sepsis/hypotension/drug
   effect, current elevation may be due to cholestasis from TPN
   - Avoid hepatotoxins, continue to trend, increased slightly over last
   few days
   # DVT: new LUE swelling, US negative for DVT.  Patient was previously
   maintained on heparin gtt but had IVC filter placed in the setting of
   emergent OR.
   - IVC filter in place
   - SC heparin
   - Holding off on hep gtt given ? perf and guaiac positive stools
   # Hypertension: Stable.  Has been hypertensive over last few days.  On
   three-drug antihypertensive regimen at home.  Will avoid PO agents due
   to ileus and concerns above.
   - Tx with IV hydralazine Q6 for now with parameters, also started on
   lopressor today as above.
   - Transition back to home meds when able
   - continue to monitor.
   # FEN: On TPN, holding TF as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical
   hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with
   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring, now extubated with delirium.
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN
   - No physical therapy per PT at this time as surgery does not want
   patient to use her abdominal muscles (high risk for dehiscence)

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), followed by small bowel (SB) resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation, which was treated with resection and side-side anastomosis, resulting in an open abdomen. She was extubated and remains in the ICU for monitoring.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardia (124 bpm), tachypnea (19 breaths/min), and hypotension (BP 146/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory support: Extubated with a clear chest X-ray
* Cardiovascular: No evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CTA, but has a small left pleural effusion
* Gastrointestinal: Small bowel perforation, with fluid collections in the peritoneal cavity, and a small abscess in the surgical resection site
* Hematological: Leukocytosis (WBC 13.6-17.9 K/uL), anemia (Hct 30.9-26.0%), and thrombocytopenia (Plt 235-544 K/uL)
* Renal: Normal creatinine (0.2-0.4 mg/dL) and normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Hepatic: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT 86-104 IU/L, AST 86-104 IU/L), and transaminitis

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient has a history of small bowel perforation and an open abdomen, which increases the risk of sepsis.
* Abscess formation: The patient has a small abscess in the surgical resection site, which may require further drainage and treatment.
* Wound infection: The patient has an open abdomen, which increases the risk of wound infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypotension may indicate respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and transaminitis may indicate hepatic failure, which requires close monitoring and treatment.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU for any signs of sepsis, abscess formation, wound infection, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, or hepatic failure.
* The patient will receive antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) for her small bowel perforation and abscess.
* The patient will continue to receive TPN and IV fluids to manage her nutritional and fluid needs.
* The patient will have her blood cultures repeated to monitor for any signs of infection.
* The patient will have her wound checked regularly to monitor for any signs of infection or abscess formation.
* The patient will have her respiratory status monitored closely to ensure that she does not develop respiratory failure.
* The patient will have her cardiac status monitored closely to ensure that she does not develop cardiac complications.
* The patient will have her renal and hepatic function monitored closely to ensure that she does not develop renal or hepatic failure."

   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Likely abdominal (abscess, perf) source of fever and leukocytosis, ?
   CVL as source, though no positive blood cultures
   - All bcx NG; peritoneal fluid growing yeast as above, continue to
   follow micro
   - Culture if spikes
   - Will attempt to have PICC placed today and remove line if possible,
   or wait for patient to be on abx for 24 hours
   # Nausea/vomiting:  Likely has some compenent of ileus in setting of
   prolonged fentanyl use and surgical manipulation, also may be rxn to
   meds, esp opiates.
   - NGT in place, position confirmed on CXR
   - Hold TF while there is perforation
   - Antiemetics PRN
   # Tachycardia: Not responsive to IVF. Urine output still adequate.
   Given tremor and delirium, may be consistent with benzo withdrawal.
   - CIWA scale with valium, has been 0-1 on scale throughout most of the

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with a subsequent small bowel perforation and side-side anastomosis. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, which has led to the diagnosis of a small bowel perforation and possible abscesses.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Abscess formation: The presence of abscesses in the peritoneal cavity and surgical resection site can lead to further complications, such as abscess rupture, sepsis, and organ damage.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel perforation can lead to a small bowel obstruction, which can cause abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and bowel movements.
4. Intestinal fistula: The perforation can also lead to the formation of an intestinal fistula, which can cause abdominal pain, fever, and signs of peritonitis.
5. Peritonitis: The presence of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity can lead to peritonitis, which can cause abdominal pain, fever, and signs of sepsis.
6. Wound infection: The patient's open abdomen and recent surgery increase the risk of wound infection, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis and organ damage.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ileus and recent surgery may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and impaired wound healing.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent extubation and respiratory compromise may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. The patient's small bowel perforation and abscesses require prompt treatment, and the patient's ileus and recent surgery may require additional management, such as nutritional support and wound care."

   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN
   - No physical therapy per PT at this time as surgery does not want

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 44 yo F with pelvic mass s/p supracervical
   hysterectomy and BSO, c/b SBO s/p resection and colostomy now with
   recent SB perforation s/p SB resection and side-side anastomosis with
   open abdomen in [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for monitoring, now extubated with delirium.
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2180-3-14**] 04:35 PM
   - Surgery recommended holding off on TFs for now since she has a
   ""contrast leak"" concerning for perforation again.  Also, with fluid
   collection/abscessess, recommended starting vanco/zosyn.
   - If afebrile x 24 hrs, will place PICC, otherwise, will need new CVL.
   Unlikely though that CVL is source of infection, likely abdomen and all
   blood cultures have been NGTD
   - No DVT in LUE
   - Fentanyl patch decreased to 100 mcg.  Also started on morphine IV PRN
   - No physical therapy per PT at this time as surgery does not want
   patient to use her abdominal muscles (high risk for dehiscence)

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) followed by small bowel resection and colostomy. She developed a small bowel perforation and was taken to the operating room for resection and side-side anastomosis with an open abdomen. She was extubated and now has a low-grade fever and leukocytosis. The patient has multiple fluid collections within the peritoneal cavity, including the left anterior pararenal space, root of the mesentery, and surgical resection site at the base of the bladder. She has a small left pleural effusion and high-density material around the liver, which may indicate a leak.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, and she has a transaminitis. Her electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Small bowel perforation: The patient has a small bowel perforation that was not closed during the initial surgery. She has a high risk of developing a surgical site infection (SSI) and may require further surgery to close the perforation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
3. Anemia: The patient has a slightly elevated hemoglobin level, which may indicate chronic blood loss or anemia.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has slightly elevated liver function tests, which may indicate liver damage or inflammation.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be related to her underlying medical condition or medications.
6. DVT: The patient has a new left upper extremity swelling, which may indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
7. Anasarca: The patient has significant edema, which may be related to her underlying medical condition, medications, or fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her small bowel perforation, leukocytosis, and transaminitis.
2. SSI: The patient has a high risk of developing a surgical site infection (SSI) due to her small bowel perforation and open abdomen.
3. DVT: The patient has a new left upper extremity swelling, which may indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her DVT and prolonged immobility.
5. Hypovolemic shock: The patient has a high risk of developing hypovolemic shock due to her fluid loss, anemia, and hypotension.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a high risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias due to her tachycardia and hypertension.
7. Renal failure: The patient has a high risk of developing renal failure due to her hypertension, anemia, and hypovolemic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid status.
2. Administer antibiotics to prevent SSI and sepsis.
3. Consider further surgery to close the small bowel perforation.
4. Monitor the patient's DVT and consider anticoagulation therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and BUN levels to prevent hypovolemic shock.
6. Consider cardiac monitoring to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function to prevent renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent surgery for a GIST tumor resection and developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO). She was re-admitted to the operating room for a laparotomy, but due to a leak, the abdominal wound remained open. The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers, likely due to an abdominal source, and has developed multiple small abscesses on abdominal CT scans. She has also been experiencing difficulty tolerating tube feeds and has been on empiric antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 125 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 147/113 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 99% and is not requiring oxygen supplementation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and a vacuum-assisted closure dressing. She has bilateral extremity edema and left upper extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.6 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 235 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 131 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include GIST tumor resection, SBO, and open abdominal wound. She has also developed abscesses, leukocytosis, and fever. The patient's plan includes empiric antibiotics, holding tube feeds due to the possibility of a small bowel leak, and oncology consultation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal abscesses increase her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Wound infection: The open abdominal wound and presence of abscesses increase the risk of wound infection.
3. Intestinal obstruction: The small bowel leak and SBO can lead to further intestinal obstruction and bowel ischemia.
4. Cholestatic liver disease: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes suggest possible cholestatic liver disease.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and possible respiratory distress increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level and positive guaiac stool tests suggest possible gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed appropriately.
8. DVT: The patient's IVC filter and prophylactic heparin therapy reduce the risk of DVT, but it is still a potential complication.
9. VAP: The patient's elevated head of bed and prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of VAP, but it is still a potential complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) for a GIST tumor, followed by a resection and colostomy. However, she developed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was taken back to the operating room for a sigmoid anastomosis, which resulted in a leak and the inability to close the abdominal wound. The patient has been managed with a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing and has been on a 10-day course of vancomycin, zosyn, and flucloxacillin for suspected peritonitis.

The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers, likely due to an abdominal source, and has been treated with empiric antibiotics. She has also developed multiple small abscesses on her abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient's post-extubation course has been notable for delirium, which has now resolved, and difficulty tolerating tube feeds (TF).

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and sinus tachycardia. Her coagulation studies are normal, and her liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Her microbiology results are pending, but she has been tested for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) and has been found to be negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Bowel perforation: Empiric vancomycin and zosyn, holding TF due to suspected small bowel leak
* GIST: Oncology consultation scheduled for today
* Leukocytosis and fever: Abdominal source is likely, but also has an old central venous catheter (CVC)
* Nausea and vomiting: TF on hold due to above issues, but nausea and vomiting have improved with clamping of the nasogastric tube
* DVT: IVC filter inserted, no heparin until cleared by surgery
* Sinus tachycardia: No clear etiology, lopressor 5mg IV every 6 hours withholds parameters
* Anemia: Guaiac-positive stools, but hematocrit stable on past several checks
* Hyperbilirubinemia: Possible cholestasis, TPN following
* HTN: IV hydralazine and lopressor
* Respiratory failure: No oxygen requirement, no respiratory distress after extubation
* PPx: Sc heparin and famotidine

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction due to the patient's abdominal leak and abscesses
* Wound infection and dehiscence due to the open abdominal wound
* Small bowel obstruction and perforation due to the patient's previous SBO
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's sinus tachycardia and hypertension
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's anemia and hyperbilirubinemia
* Hepatic complications, such as cholestasis or liver failure, due to the patient's hyperbilirubinemia and possible cholestasis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who underwent supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) due to a GIST tumor. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

The patient has a suspected small bowel (SB) leak, which is being treated with empiric vancomycin and zosyn. She also has multiple abscesses on her abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, which are being treated with the same antibiotics. A nasogastric (NG) tube has been inserted, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 125 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 147/113 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, leukocytosis, and hyperbilirubinemia. Her platelet count is normal, and her liver enzymes are elevated. She has a guaiac-positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being treated with hydralazine and lopressor. She also has a history of sinus tachycardia, which is being treated with metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's suspected SB leak and multiple abscesses on her abdominal CT scan increase her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen her anemia and increase her risk of bleeding complications.
3. Wound dehiscence: The patient's history of surgery and suspected SB leak increase her risk of developing wound dehiscence.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which can worsen her condition.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypertension increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output increase her risk of developing renal failure.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia increase her risk of developing hepatic failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and treatment of her underlying conditions to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."
