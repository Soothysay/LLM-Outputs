You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 120.5 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of headache post coital. The patient has been experiencing a 24-hour fever with a temperature of 101.8°F, and has been receiving treatment for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and a possible seizure disorder.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 162/73 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place, and the patient is sedated with propofol and fentanyl. The patient's cardiac examination is notable for a narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 160-80s, which is thought to be related to light sedation/movement/agitation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.1 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 209 x 10^9/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 10.5 mmol/L, and the patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's fluid balance is stable, with a total fluid intake of 5,002 mL and a total fluid output of 3,055 mL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 152 mmol/L, a potassium level of 3.6 mmol/L, and a magnesium level of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's imaging studies show a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place. The patient's cardiac examination is notable for a narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 160-80s.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the patient's fluid balance is stable, and the patient may be at risk for electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient may be at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac examination is notable for a narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 160-80s, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical condition or the patient's sedation.
5. Seizures: The patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place, and the patient is receiving treatment for a possible seizure disorder.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection.
7. Cerebral edema: The patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place, and the patient may be at risk for cerebral edema.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the patient's management should include:

1. Antibiotic therapy: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, and the patient should receive antibiotic therapy.
2. Fluid management: The patient's fluid balance is stable, but the patient may be at risk for electrolyte imbalances, and the patient's fluid management should be closely monitored.
3. Respiratory support: The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory support should be closely monitored.
4. Cardiac monitoring: The patient's cardiac examination is notable for a narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 160-80s, and the patient's cardiac monitoring should be closely monitored.
5. Seizure prophylaxis: The patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place, and the patient should receive seizure prophylaxis.
6. Infection control: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, and the patient's infection control should be closely monitored.
7. Cerebral edema monitoring: The patient's neurological examination is notable for a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of cerebral edema."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

Key Findings:

* The patient has a fever of 101.8°F (38.8°C) and has been in an irregular narrow complex tachycardia with variable block, which may be related to light sedation, movement, or agitation.
* The patient has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is being treated with Nimodipine for cerebral vasospasm.
* The patient has bilateral ventriculostomy drains in place and is receiving Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
* The patient has a tracheostomy and is intubated, with plans to change to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
* The patient has a Foley catheter and is receiving tube feeds.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.1, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 209 K/uL.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which is a potential complication in patients with SAH.
* Cerebral vasospasm: The patient is receiving Nimodipine to prevent cerebral vasospasm, but this medication may not be effective in all cases, and vasospasm can still occur.
* Ventriculitis: The patient has bilateral ventriculostomy drains in place, which may increase the risk of ventriculitis.
* Pneumonia: The patient is intubated and receiving tube feeds, which may increase the risk of pneumonia.
* Seizures: The patient is receiving Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, but this medication may not be effective in all cases, and seizures can still occur.
* Blood stream infection: The patient has a central line in place, which may increase the risk of blood stream infection.
* Wound infection: The patient has a head wound and is receiving tube feeds, which may increase the risk of wound infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but may still be at risk for respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including sepsis, cerebral vasospasm, ventriculitis, pneumonia, seizures, blood stream infection, wound infection, and respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to ensure the patient's safety and optimal outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who suffered a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). He has been sedated and paralyzed to control ICP, and is receiving pentobarbital, mannitol, and hypertonic saline. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/83 mmHg. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and mild hyponatremia. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with an increased sodium level and decreased potassium level. His blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes a previous aneurysm that was coiled, and he has undergone craniectomy and hematoma evacuation. He is currently receiving nimodipine to prevent cerebral vasospasm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is increasing, which can lead to brain herniation and death. Close monitoring and management of ICP are essential.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the ventriculostomy drains and in the head wound. Close monitoring of his temperature and laboratory results is essential.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac rhythm is stable, but he is at risk of developing arrhythmias, particularly with the use of medications such as pentobarbital.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, and he is at risk of developing further hemorrhages, particularly in the brain.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain edema."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm that was coiled. He underwent craniectomy and hematoma evacuation, and is currently being treated with ventriculostomy drains, mannitol, and pentobarb coma to manage his increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/83 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC of 17.3 K/uL. His hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, and his platelet count is 209 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a sodium level of 155 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is currently 25 mmHg, which is above the normal range. This can lead to brain herniation and other serious complications.
2. Fever: The patient's temperature is 101.1°F, which is above normal. This can be a sign of infection, which can worsen his condition.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium level is slightly abnormal, which can lead to muscle weakness, cramps, and other complications.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can indicate kidney damage.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Brain herniation: If the patient's ICP continues to increase, it can lead to brain herniation, which can be life-threatening.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which can worsen his condition.
3. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests kidney damage, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but if not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated blood pressure and heart rate suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a number of medical complications, including increased intracranial pressure, fever, electrolyte imbalance, renal insufficiency, and respiratory failure. It is essential to closely monitor his condition and manage his treatment accordingly to prevent these complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who suffered a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He underwent coiling and craniectomy with hematoma evacuation. He is currently intubated and sedated, with increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs). His vital signs are stable, but he has a fever of 38.1°C (100.6°F) and is receiving treatment for electrolyte and fluid disorders. He has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. His blood pressure is stable, and he is receiving medication for pain and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased ICPs: The patient's ICPs are increasing, which can lead to brain herniation, cerebral edema, and decreased cerebral perfusion.
2. Seizures: The patient is receiving medication for seizure prophylaxis, but he is still at risk for developing seizures due to his SAH and aneurysm.
3. Infection: The patient has a tracheostomy and is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a fever and is receiving treatment for electrolyte and fluid disorders, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he is at risk for developing cardiovascular instability due to his SAH and aneurysm.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status is at risk for deterioration due to his SAH and aneurysm.
7. Neurological deficits: The patient has a high risk of developing neurological deficits due to his SAH and aneurysm, which can lead to long-term disability.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's ICPs and adjust his treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to provide seizure prophylaxis and monitor for signs of seizure activity.
3. Continue to manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and monitor for signs of worsening electrolyte disorders.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and adjust his treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment accordingly.
6. Continue to provide neurological monitoring and adjust the patient's treatment accordingly.
7. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon and other specialists to develop a comprehensive plan for the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 28-year-old male who suffered a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is suspected to have an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He underwent coiling, craniectomy, and hematoma evacuation.
* The patient is intubated and sedated, with a pentobarb coma, and is being monitored for increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
* His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 148/79 mmHg.
* He has a bilateral ventriculostomy drain in place and is receiving Keppra, Nimodipine, and mannitol for cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis.
* His electrolyte and fluid balance are being closely monitored, and he is receiving ddavp to minimize his urine output.
* The patient has a history of diabetes insipidus and is showing signs of dehydration.
* His respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on a FiO2 of 50%.
* He has a left-sided pleural effusion and is being treated with antibiotics for possible sepsis.
* The patient's neurologic status is unchanged, with no spontaneous movement or response to stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current status include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is elevated, and it is essential to monitor it closely to prevent further increases.
2. Cerebral vasospasm: The patient is receiving Nimodipine for cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis, but it is crucial to monitor his neurologic status and ICP closely to detect any signs of vasospasm.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is being treated with antibiotics. It is essential to monitor his temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory values to detect any signs of sepsis.
4. Dehydration: The patient is showing signs of dehydration, and it is essential to monitor his fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely to prevent further dehydration.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and sedated, and it is essential to monitor his respiratory status closely to detect any signs of respiratory complications.
6. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic status is unchanged, and it is essential to monitor him closely for any signs of deterioration.

In conclusion, the patient's current status is critical, and it is essential to monitor him closely for any signs of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   oxygenation poor overnight, had to inc fi02 to 60% again, and inc peep
   to 14, icp slowly inc to 14->16->18, and BP started drifting below 180,
   had to start levophed, and was maxed out on levophed/neo, gave fluid
   bolus and fentanyl. started breathing over vent and becoming
   tachycardic, likely waking from pentobarb. pain control and fluid

The patient is a 28-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) following an aneurysm rupture. He underwent coiling and craniectomy, and a ventriculostomy was placed to manage increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs). The patient's condition has been unstable, with ICPs ranging from 12-18 mmHg, and he has required increasing doses of pressors to maintain blood pressure above 180 mmHg.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's oxygenation has been poor, requiring increases in FiO2 and PEEP. He has also experienced intermittent hypoxia and has been intubated. The patient's temperature has been elevated, with a maximum of 101.9°F (38.8°C), and he has been receiving antibiotics.

The patient's neurological examination has revealed signs of waking from barbiturate coma, with no spontaneous movement or response to stimuli. He has been receiving Keppra and Nimodipine to manage his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased ICPs: The patient's ICPs are still elevated, and there is a risk of further increases, which could lead to brain herniation or death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation has been poor, and he may require further increases in FiO2 and PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection, which could worsen his condition.
4. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and he has required increasing doses of pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and risk of stress ulceration make him prone to gastrointestinal complications.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's high sodium levels and risk of diuretic-induced electrolyte imbalances make him prone to renal complications.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and risk of bleeding make him prone to hematological complications.
8. Endocrine Complications: The patient's elevated cortisol levels and risk of adrenal insufficiency make him prone to endocrine complications.
9. Infectious Complications: The patient's risk of infection and sepsis make him prone to infectious complications.
10. Wound Complications: The patient's head wound and risk of infection make him prone to wound complications.

Overall, the patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after a coiling procedure for an aneurysm. He has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs), requiring frequent adjustments to his ventilator settings and medication. He has also developed a fever, which has been difficult to control. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored due to concerns about cerebral perfusion pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased ICPs: The patient's ICPs have been increasing, which can lead to brain herniation and increased risk of mortality. Close monitoring and adjustments to his ventilation and medication are necessary to manage this complication.
2. Fever: The patient's fever has been difficult to control, which can increase his risk of infection and worsen his condition. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the fever and manage it effectively.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored due to concerns about cerebral perfusion pressure. Hypertension can worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which can increase his risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustments to his ventilation settings are necessary to manage this complication.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status has been deteriorating, which can be a sign of increased ICPs or other complications. Close monitoring and evaluation are necessary to determine the cause of the deterioration and manage it effectively.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line and other invasive devices, which can increase his risk of infection. Close monitoring and evaluation are necessary to detect any signs of infection and manage it effectively.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored due to concerns about cerebral perfusion pressure. Hypertension can worsen his condition and increase his risk of kidney injury.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and evaluation are necessary to manage his increasing ICPs, fever, and other complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the fever and manage it effectively. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored, and adjustments to his medication and ventilation settings should be made as necessary. The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored, and any signs of deterioration should be promptly evaluated and managed."
