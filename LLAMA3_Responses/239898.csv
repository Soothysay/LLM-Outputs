   Microbiology: None.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is currently being treated with digoxin for rate control. The patient's respiratory status has improved with diuresis and oxygen therapy, but he remains at risk for worsening respiratory distress due to his underlying pulmonary disease.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient is at high risk for PE due to his malignancy and is currently being treated with lovenox for anticoagulation. However, the patient's recent CT chest scan showed extensive right main, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary emboli, which may worsen his respiratory status.
2. **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):** The patient's AFib with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) may lead to further deterioration of his respiratory status and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. **Respiratory Distress:** The patient's respiratory status may worsen due to his underlying pulmonary disease, which may lead to respiratory failure and the need for intubation.
4. **Hyponatremia:** The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to SIADH, which may worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of seizures and other complications.
5. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's CXR showed possible pulmonary edema, which may worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of respiratory failure.
6. **Malignancy Progression:** The patient's NSCLC may progress, leading to worsening respiratory distress and decreased quality of life.
7. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's digoxin therapy may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox for PE.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Continue rate control with digoxin.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Consider advancing the patient's diet today.
6. Continue to trend the patient's serum sodium level and adjust fluid restriction as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's lung cancer for progression and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: SOB
   24 Hour Events:
   -bil LENIs negative for DVT.
   -switched from dilt drip to po digoxin with close EKG monitoring as
   patient's SBP was low in the 80s and it was felt that digoxin would
   provide rate control with less effects on blood pressure. Patient
   converted to NSR overnight, now on 0.125 mg daily of digoxin.

   -Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**]: intubation is warranted in the acute setting since he
   will likely improve his respiratory status within the next 24-48 hours
   and his overall outlook from his non-small-cell lung cancer is not that
   grim (his median survival for patients with EGFR mutated
   adenocarcinomas and stage IV disease is around 24 months). No ertonolib

Summary:

The patient is a 81-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer, stage IV, EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma, who is admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 96.6°F, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. His physical examination is limited due to his intubation.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. His liver and renal function tests are normal. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits. His imaging studies show bilateral pulmonary emboli, diffuse metastasis, and a moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli may lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung cancer and pulmonary emboli may lead to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of developing infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and potential bleeding diathesis may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient's underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications may lead to renal failure.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient's underlying liver disease and potential hepatotoxicity from medications may lead to hepatic failure.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and renal function."

   Imaging: CT--Right main segmental and sub-segmental PE's.  Mod
   loculated Left Pleural Effusion.  CXR
Moderate increase in interstitial
   markings and loss of lung volume on left side consistent with known
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo with stage IV lung cancer admitted 2 days ago with PE
   compliacated by A-Fib and now maintained in ICU.
   1) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-_conversion to NSR this morning, this may
   well be related to acute insult of PE and now with continued risk for
   recurrence and tachycardia.
   -WIll maintain on Digoxin at this time
   -Follow on telemetry
   2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-Compromise secondary to PE
   and known lung cancer most prominently.  He still remains with
   substantial and significant oxygen requirement.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated-likely to evolve over the course of days.
   -Continue treatment for  PE
   -Effusion evalauted and not adequate volume for drainage but will have
   to be followed
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow
   -Aspiration precautions
   3) PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE-

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU 2 days ago with a pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient's condition has improved, with conversion to sinus rhythm and subjective improvement in dyspnea. However, the patient remains critically ill, requiring non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.

The patient has a history of lung cancer, which is likely contributing to his respiratory failure and PE. He also has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is being monitored but not yet suitable for drainage.

The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox and will continue to be monitored for bleeding complications. He is also receiving digoxin to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent recurrence of AFib.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of AFib: The patient's conversion to sinus rhythm may be related to the acute insult of the PE, and he may be at risk for recurrence.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and he may require further weaning of oxygen therapy.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's PE is likely to be a recurring problem, and he may require ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cancer Progression: The patient's lung cancer is likely to continue to progress, and he may require further treatment, including chemotherapy.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing an infection, particularly in the context of his respiratory failure and immunosuppression.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's AFib and PE may increase his risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest or heart failure."

   Imaging:
   CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or
   ARDS
   should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

   Imaging:
   CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or
   ARDS
   should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +) admitted with large right main bronchus PE, who developed atrial fibrillation with RVR on admission and respiratory distress. The patient is anticoagulated with Lovenox and is currently oxygenating well on a non-rebreather mask (NRB). The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with worsening hypoxia, and CXR shows increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung, consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a large right main bronchus PE and is at high risk of developing further pulmonary emboli.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely secondary to his PE and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to his lung cancer and may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Sepsis: The patient's worsening airspace disease and respiratory distress may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
6. ARDS: The patient's worsening airspace disease and respiratory distress may increase his risk of developing ARDS.
7. Pulmonary infarct: The patient's large PE may lead to pulmonary infarcts, which can be life-threatening.

Assessment and plan:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status will be monitored closely, and oxygen therapy will be continued as needed. The patient will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation will be monitored closely, and digoxin will be continued at a dose of 0.125 mg daily.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium will be trended, and fluid restriction will be continued at 1L daily.
5. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC will be managed with morphine for pain control and other supportive care as needed.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient will receive regular mechanical soft nutrition with a 1.5L fluid restriction.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood sugar will be monitored closely, and insulin will be administered as needed to maintain glycemic control.
3. Lines: The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on [**2180-1-28**] 06:26 AM.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive DVT prophylaxis with LMW heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine.
5. Comments: The patient's code status is full code."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, which was converted to sinus tachycardia with digoxin. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a non-rebreather mask and has a SpO2 of 92%. They are also receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for thromboprophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/86 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 92%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid balance of -650 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and potentially sepsis. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, which may indicate respiratory failure or worsening lung function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels suggest ongoing inflammation and potentially sepsis.
3. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for thromboprophylaxis, but their platelet count is elevated, which may indicate a risk of thrombosis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest ongoing infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +), was admitted to the ICU with large right main bronchus PE, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and respiratory distress. The patient was anticoagulated with lovenox and treated with BiPAP and high-flow mask with 5L oxygen, which improved his respiratory status. The patient's atrial fibrillation converted to normal sinus rhythm overnight. The patient has a history of NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and metastases to the spine, sternum, ribs, and basal ganglia, and is being treated with pain control medication. The patient has hyponatremia, likely secondary to lung cancer, and is being managed with fluid restriction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and further deterioration is possible. The patient's large PE and anticoagulation with lovenox may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may increase the risk of stroke and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's high risk of PE due to malignancy and anticoagulation with lovenox may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC with metastases may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and treatment may increase the risk of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation with lovenox may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of respiratory distress.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox and monitor for signs of bleeding.
3. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medication and monitor for signs of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Continue treatment for NSCLC with pain control medication and monitor for signs of disease progression.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hyponatremia with fluid restriction and monitor for signs of worsening.
6. Consider advancing the patient's diet today, if tolerated.
7. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust treatment as needed to maintain glycemic control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxemia. He has a history of metastatic lung cancer. The patient's sinus rhythm has been maintained, and he is being treated with anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism. His oxygenation has improved, and he is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. His abdominal examination is normal, and his neurological examination is intact.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 162 K/uL. His creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and his glucose is 104 mg/dL. His imaging studies show worsening diffuse infiltrates on the right side, which are concerning for hemorrhage, infarction, or worsening of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Atrial fibrillation: Continue in sinus rhythm, and continue digoxin.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Wean oxygen as tolerated, continue treatment for pulmonary embolism, and monitor for any evidence of infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism, acute: Continue anticoagulation and follow for any evidence of hemorrhage.
4. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: Further treatment based on clinical improvement and recovery from acute insult.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient's worsening diffuse infiltrates on the right side are concerning for hemorrhage, which could be a complication of the pulmonary embolism.
2. Infarction: The patient's lung infiltrates could also be a sign of infarction, which could be a complication of the pulmonary embolism.
3. Worsening of lymphangitic carcinomatosis: The patient's lung infiltrates could also be a sign of worsening of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, which could be a complication of the patient's metastatic lung cancer.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
5. Infection: The patient's acute respiratory failure could also be complicated by infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's metastatic lung cancer could progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life."

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Code status: Full code<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a history of large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient was also found to have atrial fibrillation with right ventricular pressure overload (RVR) following intubation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 6.8-8.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.8-11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 150-200 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 15-19 mg/dL
* Sodium (Na): 133-136 mmol/L
* Potassium (K): 4.5-5.1 mmol/L
* Chloride (Cl): 96-100 mmol/L
* Carbon dioxide (CO2): 22-24 mmol/L
* Glucose: 67-106 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung, particularly in the upper lobe, consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease.
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: Not performed.

The patient's medical history and current condition are:

* Stage IV NSCLC with EGFR mutation
* Large right main bronchus PE
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Hypoxia requiring non-rebreather mask (NRB)
* Respiratory distress
* Hyponatremia likely secondary to lung cancer
* SIADH

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Oxygen therapy as tolerated
* Anticoagulation with lovenox for PE
* Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily
* Monitoring of respiratory status
* Intubation if respiratory status worsens significantly
* Morphine for pain control
* Fluid restriction to 1L daily
* Trending of serum sodium
* Continue mechanical soft diet

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Pulmonary embolism
* Atrial fibrillation
* Hyponatremia
* SIADH
* Malnutrition
* Infection
* Sepsis
* Organ failure

The patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient also developed atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with right ventricular failure (RVR) following intubation, requiring neostigmine.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with APRV (airway pressure release ventilation) mode, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) of 18 cmH2O, and a respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygenation is compromised, with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 91 mmHg, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.2 K/uL, and a decreased platelet count (PLT) of 150 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung, consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease, which may be related to pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and requirement for intubation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's development of AFIB following intubation increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's elevated D-dimer level and radiological findings of increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung may indicate a pulmonary embolism.
4. Cancer: The patient's diagnosis of lung cancer increases the risk of complications related to the underlying malignancy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's AFIB and RVR may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock, particularly if the patient's cardiac output is compromised.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and requirement for intubation increase the risk of respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by underlying lung disease.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's radiological findings of increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung may indicate the development of pneumonia, which may be complicated by sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and radiological findings of increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung may indicate the development of sepsis, which may be complicated by multi-organ dysfunction.
5. ARDS: The patient's radiological findings of increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung may indicate the development of ARDS, which may be complicated by respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) on admission and now requires invasive ventilation with a FiO2 of 100%. The patient's condition has worsened, with increasing parenchymal opacity on chest X-ray, consistent with ARDS, and he is at risk for further deterioration.

Potential medical complications:

1. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further worsening of hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He requires continued LTTV, increased PEEP, and decreased FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Shock: The patient is likely in cardiogenic shock due to his large PE and positive pressure ventilation, which has decreased preload. He may also have hypovolemic shock, but this is less likely given his fluid status.
3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely secondary to his PE and may require rate control with digoxin.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at high risk for further PEs given his malignancy and should continue anticoagulation with lovenox.
5. NSCLC: The patient has advanced lung cancer with metastases to multiple sites and should be monitored for further progression.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to SIADH and should be monitored with trended serum Na levels.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection given his immunocompromised state and should be monitored for signs of sepsis.
8. Fluid overload: The patient may be at risk for fluid overload given his positive fluid balance and should be monitored for signs of fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Continue LTTV and adjust PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and intubate if necessary.
3. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust rate control as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's NSCLC and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and adjust fluid management as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and sepsis.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of fluid overload and adjust fluid management as necessary."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Code status: Full code<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +) who was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress and is currently on LTTV with FiO2 of 80%. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, shock, and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Progressive hypoxia: The patient's oxygenation status is deteriorating, and he may require increasing levels of oxygen supplementation or even intubation if his respiratory status worsens.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung disease is worsening, and he may develop respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism due to his underlying malignancy and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are low, which may be due to SIADH or other causes, and may lead to neurological complications if left untreated.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia or other infections due to his intubation and immobility.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is critical, and he may develop fluid overload if his diuresis is not adequate.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tumor burden may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of his respiratory, cardiac, and fluid status. He should be continued on anticoagulation therapy and monitored for signs of bleeding or thrombosis. His oxygenation status should be closely monitored, and he should be weaned off oxygen supplementation as tolerated. His cardiac status should be closely monitored, and he should be treated for atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias. His hyponatremia should be closely monitored, and he should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

He was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of supraventricular tachycardia.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and worsening hypotension. He is on maximum doses of phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin to support his blood pressure. He has a high risk of developing further complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is likely secondary to his PE, and he is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia increase his risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. ARDS: The patient's CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity in the right upper lobe, which is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia increase his risk of developing pneumonia, which could be caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens.
6. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension increases his risk of developing further complications, including organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's lab results show hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to his lung cancer and could lead to seizures and other neurological complications.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to address these potential complications."

   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   3. Shock.  Likely cardiogenic, [**12-21**] PE and now with decreased pre load
   from positive pressure ventilation.  Possibly hypovolemic, but given ~
   4L yesterday.  Septic shock less likely given no e/o infection, but
   willobtainc ultures regardless, given patient
s critical status.  Other
   cardiogenic causes possible (ie. Ischemia) but nl echo two days ago.
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC, was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and shock. He was intubated and paralyzed on a low-tidal volume ventilator (LTVV) and is requiring maximum doses of vasopressors. His condition has worsened overnight, with increasing hypoxemia and hypercarbia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive ARDS: The patient's ARDS is likely to worsen due to the ongoing hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's shock is likely cardiogenic, possibly due to decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation and/or underlying cardiac disease. Close monitoring of cardiac function and fluid status is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may continue to worsen, leading to further respiratory and circulatory compromise.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to further cardiac instability and increased risk of thromboembolic events.
5. NSCLC Progression: The patient's NSCLC may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory and circulatory compromise.
6. Sepsis: The patient's critical illness may lead to the development of sepsis, which could further compromise his respiratory and circulatory function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue LTVV and adjust PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated to optimize oxygenation.
2. Titrate up RR and TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
3. Bolus LR prn to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Wean pressors as tolerated to minimize cardiovascular compromise.
5. Monitor cardiac function and fluid status closely to prevent further deterioration.
6. Consider IV bicarb if the patient's acidemia worsens.
7. Discuss goals with oncology given the patient's significant clinical deterioration.
8. Monitor for signs of sepsis and take prompt action if developed."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of lung cancer and admitted with PE complicated
   by A-fib and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had substantial
   worsening across past 24 hours now to the point of persistent and dense
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock likely secondary to both
   compromise of right heart SV in the setting of ARDS as well as
   vasodilatory shock in the setting of ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure-have pursued alternative modes of ventilation but
   still have severe respiratory acidosis in the setting of some improved
   capacity to stabilize oxygenation on FIO2 of 1.0.  We are left,
   however, with persistent and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   This is attributable to significant dead space ventilation which has
   unfortunately progressed at this time.  This may be due to ineffective
   perfusion, overdistention of non-dependent lung units.  We have RR at a
   maximum at this time.  For his respiratory failure we will
   A)Hypoxemia
he will have PEEP titration today to determine optimal PEEP
   and hopefully allow some down titration of FIO2
   -Fent/Versed/Cisatra--at
 to allow passive support today
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 1.0
   -Will have to consider move to prone position if we are unable to
   maintain effective saturation with above measures.
   B)Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure-
   -This will have to be improved given severe acidemia
   -Will increase RR to 30 as possible
   -Will remove dead space from ventilatory circuit
   -Will have to increase tidal volume even though we will move beyond
   6cc/Kg given inability to maintain acceptable ventilation at this time
   -Will trial fluid bolus if are left with persistent and severe
   compromise of effective ventilation
   2)Shock-
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 this morning to aid in confirmation of
   source of shock which at this point may well be a dominant finding of
   vasodilatory shock where what may have been a relative hypovolemic
   state at the onset.  In addition
we will need reasonable assessment of
   CVP at this time with a goal CVP of approximately 12 viewed as
   significant evidence against hypovolemic shock
   -Will check CvO2 to guide differential
   -Will send cultures for possible septic source if fever seen
   -Vasopressin 0.4-Levophed 0.45-Neo to continue
will look to correct pH
   as we can with ventilator and will utilize HCO3- as needed for blood
   pressure response
   -Will check ECG for possible myocardial ischemia
   -Do not see evidence of recurrent PE but is certainly of concern
   3) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Rate control as needed
   -SR for now
   4) PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   -On Lovenox
   5) CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG-
   -Will update primary oncology team in light of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of lung cancer and admitted with PE complicated
   by A-fib and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had substantial
   worsening across past 24 hours now to the point of persistent and dense
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock likely secondary to both
   compromise of right heart SV in the setting of ARDS as well as
   vasodilatory shock in the setting of ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure-have pursued alternative modes of ventilation but
   still have severe respiratory acidosis in the setting of some improved
   capacity to stabilize oxygenation on FIO2 of 1.0.  We are left,
   however, with persistent and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   This is attributable to significant dead space ventilation which has
   unfortunately progressed at this time.  This may be due to ineffective
   perfusion, overdistention of non-dependent lung units.  We have RR at a
   maximum at this time.  For his respiratory failure we will
   A)Hypoxemia
he will have PEEP titration today to determine optimal PEEP
   and hopefully allow some down titration of FIO2
   -Fent/Versed/Cisatra--at
 to allow passive support today
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 1.0
   -Will have to consider move to prone position if we are unable to
   maintain effective saturation with above measures.
   B)Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure-
   -This will have to be improved given severe acidemia
   -Will increase RR to 30 as possible
   -Will remove dead space from ventilatory circuit
   -Will have to increase tidal volume even though we will move beyond
   6cc/Kg given inability to maintain acceptable ventilation at this time
   -Will trial fluid bolus if are left with persistent and severe
   compromise of effective ventilation
   2)Shock-
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 this morning to aid in confirmation of
   source of shock which at this point may well be a dominant finding of
   vasodilatory shock where what may have been a relative hypovolemic
   state at the onset.  In addition
we will need reasonable assessment of
   CVP at this time with a goal CVP of approximately 12 viewed as
   significant evidence against hypovolemic shock
   -Will check CvO2 to guide differential
   -Will send cultures for possible septic source if fever seen
   -Vasopressin 0.4-Levophed 0.45-Neo to continue
will look to correct pH
   as we can with ventilator and will utilize HCO3- as needed for blood
   pressure response
   -Will check ECG for possible myocardial ischemia

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, admitted with pulmonary embolism (PE) complicated by atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has had substantial worsening across the past 24 hours, with persistent and dense hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure with persistent and dense hypoxia, despite maximal ventilatory support. The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0. The patient's respiratory acidosis is severe, with a pH of 7.15.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is in shock, with a blood pressure of 86/69 mmHg and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin.
* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and paralyzed.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) is 10.8 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) is 200 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 15 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.6 mg/dL, and lactate level is 1.6 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further worsening of respiratory failure, leading to increased risk of respiratory arrest and death.
2. Progression of shock, leading to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Development of sepsis, leading to further worsening of shock and increased risk of mortality.
4. Recurrent pulmonary embolism, leading to further worsening of respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
5. Myocardial ischemia or infarction, leading to further worsening of cardiovascular status and increased risk of mortality.
6. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy and vasopressor therapy.
7. Development of acute kidney injury or failure, leading to further worsening of cardiovascular status and increased risk of mortality.
8. Development of septic shock, leading to further worsening of cardiovascular status and increased risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue to optimize respiratory support, including titration of PEEP and FiO2, and consideration of prone positioning.
2. Continue to manage shock, including evaluation of CvO2, CVP, and vasopressor therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider weaning from paralysis when possible.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including WBC, Hb, Plt, BUN, Cr, and lactate level, and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Consider consultation with cardiothoracic surgery and/or critical care medicine to optimize the patient's care.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider consultation with cardiology if necessary.
7. Consider consultation with infectious disease to optimize management of sepsis and potential septic shock.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust therapy as necessary."

   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with ARDS, on vent with shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1. Shock.  Cause of shock likely multifactorial.  Partly cardiogenic,
   [**12-21**] PE and now with with decreased pre load from positive pressure
   ventilation.  Also intermittently in atrial fibrillation with rates as
   high as 130, possibly contributing to poor output and shock. in Less
   likely hypovolemic, but given +9L yesterday.  Spiking fevers, likely
   septic component, blood cultures urine cultures sent, startedd on broac
   spectrum antibiotics.
   - mixed venous sat, if low
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone IV 50mg
   - continue vanc/cefepime, add levofloxacin
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with ARDS, on vent with shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1. Shock.  Cause of shock likely multifactorial.  Partly cardiogenic,
   [**12-21**] PE and now with with decreased pre load from positive pressure
   ventilation.  Also intermittently in atrial fibrillation with rates as
   high as 130, possibly contributing to poor output and shock. in Less
   likely hypovolemic, but given +9L yesterday.  Spiking fevers, likely
   septic component, blood cultures urine cultures sent, startedd on broac
   spectrum antibiotics.
   - mixed venous sat, if low
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone IV 50mg
   - continue vanc/cefepime, add levofloxacin
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is admitted to the ICU with a pulmonary embolism, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He is currently intubated and paralyzed on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100%. The patient has a history of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and has been treated with erlotinib.

The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with a spike in fever to 102.2°F and continued hypoxemia. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and has had blood cultures and urine cultures sent.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 129 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 70/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 0 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 14 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 26 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 126 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 92 mEq/L
* Lactic acid: 5.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypoxemia suggest a possible septic response, which could worsen his condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in his lung function.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and decreased preload due to positive pressure ventilation may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia make him susceptible to infection, which could worsen his condition.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.

Assessment and plan:

1. Shock: The patient's shock is likely multifactorial, and treatment should focus on addressing the underlying causes.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS should be managed with permissive hypercapnia and titration of respiratory support.
3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation should be managed with digoxin and monitoring of his heart rate.
4. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC should be managed with chemotherapy and targeted therapy as appropriate.
5. Infection: The patient's infection should be managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and further evaluation.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure should be managed with fluid restriction and further evaluation.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance should be managed with electrolyte replacement and further evaluation."

   COMPARISON: [**2180-1-30**].
   INDICATION: Orogastric tube placement.
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to
   the recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   CXR [**1-31**]:
   INDICATION: Respiratory failure.
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear
   appreciably changed in the short interval between the two studies.
   Small right pleural effusion also appears similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with dramatic clinical deterioration overnight with ARDS,
   intubation/mechanical ventilation and shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   3. Shock.  Likely cardiogenic, [**12-21**] PE and now with decreased pre load
   from positive pressure ventilation.  Possibly hypovolemic, but given ~
   4L yesterday.  Septic shock less likely given no e/o infection, but
   willobtainc ultures regardless, given patient
s critical status.  Other
   cardiogenic causes possible (ie. Ischemia) but nl echo two days ago.
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was admitted to the ICU with a large right pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Overnight, he developed severe clinical deterioration, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and maximal pressors to support his blood pressure. He also spiked a fever to 102.2°F and was started on empiric antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* ARDS with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Shock, likely cardiogenic, with decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation
* Pulmonary embolism
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Stage IV NSCLC with widespread metastases

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to increased oxygen requirements, ventilator-induced lung injury, and mortality.
2. Septic shock: Despite the lack of obvious infection, the patient's septic status could worsen, leading to organ failure and death.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock could progress, leading to decreased cardiac output, organ dysfunction, and mortality.
4. Pulmonary embolism complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism could lead to further respiratory failure, right ventricular dysfunction, and mortality.
5. Atrial fibrillation complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, stroke, and mortality.
6. NSCLC progression: The patient's NSCLC could progress, leading to further metastases, organ failure, and mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory status by increasing PEEP, decreasing FiO2, and titrating up RR and TV as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust pressors as necessary to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including ECG and echocardiogram, to assess for signs of cardiogenic shock.
4. Continue empiric antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
5. Discuss the patient's goals of care with the oncology team, given his significant clinical deterioration.
6. Consider IV bicarb and fluid boluses as needed to manage the patient's acidemia and hypotension."

   -If increased CvO2
will have to evaluate for alternative sources for
   persistent sepsis and do have concern for possible adrenal
   insufficiency and if increased or equivocal will move to test random
   cortisol and provide steroid replacment

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%. He is also receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating sepsis, and his blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and pending blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and PE may lead to continued respiratory failure, requiring further mechanical ventilation and possible extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible cardiogenic shock may lead to cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infections: The patient's antibiotic treatment and pending blood cultures suggest the possibility of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
5. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Psychosocial Complications: The patient's DNR status and potential for prolonged ICU stay may lead to psychosocial complications, including depression, anxiety, and family distress.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient is still intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (with a range of 106-134 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/13 mmHg (with a range of 104-13-49 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-34 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL
* Glucose: 240 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which have somewhat decreased in the upper zones. The patient also has a left apical mass, moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace opacities superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases.

The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, severe with organ dysfunction, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient's cancer diagnosis is also a significant factor in their condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Development of septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* Progression of cancer and metastases
* Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunosuppression and invasive devices

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic functions. The patient's family should be kept informed of their condition and any changes, and a multidisciplinary team should be involved in their care to ensure optimal management of their complex condition."

   Imaging: CXR [**2-1**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], the monitoring and
   support
   devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.
   CXR [**1-31**] #2:
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be anuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday. consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.
   CXR [**1-31**] #2:
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be anuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday. consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +), is admitted to the ICU with a large right pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He is intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator, receiving maximum dose of three pressors to support his blood pressure. He has a fever, and his blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (with irregular rhythm)
* Blood pressure: 104/13 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* CVP: 11 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 194 mg/dL
* Glucose: 240 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 5.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, left apical mass, and moderate left pleural effusion
* CT scan: widespread skeletal metastases

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Shock: likely multifactorial, with possible causes including cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic shock.
2. ARDS: patient is intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator, with improving oxygenation.
3. Pulmonary embolism: patient is receiving heparin gtt.
4. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: patient is receiving digoxin, and cardioversion and amiodarone load are being considered.
5. Acute renal failure: patient is anuric, with creatinine up to 2.6 mg/dL, and grossly fluid overloaded.
6. NSCLC: patient has a primary left apical lesion and metastases to the spine, sternum, ribs, and basal ganglia.
7. Goals of care: patient's respiratory status is improving modestly, but his hemodynamic status is deteriorating, and the likelihood of a return to baseline neurological status is low.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: patient's fever and laboratory results are concerning for sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is anuric.
3. Respiratory failure: patient's ARDS is improving, but he is still intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator.
4. Cardiovascular instability: patient's blood pressure is low, and he is receiving multiple pressors.
5. Neurological decline: patient's neurological status is deteriorating, and the likelihood of a return to baseline status is low.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is being considered:

1. Continue vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for sepsis.
2. Start levofloxacin.
3. Sputum culture, blood cultures, urine cultures, and LFTs are pending.
4. Stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6) are being considered.
5. Hemodialysis may be necessary if the patient's renal function does not improve.
6. Cardioversion and amiodarone load are being considered for atrial fibrillation.
7. Morphine for pain control is being considered.
8. Goals of care discussion with the family is ongoing, and the possibility of withdrawing care is being considered."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: CXR [**2-1**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], the monitoring and
   support
   devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.
   CXR [**1-31**] #2:
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be aneuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday, consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and a PEEP of 12 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (irregularly irregular)
* Blood pressure: 104/13 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure: 11 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 31.3%
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL
* Glucose: 240 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 5.5 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) showing diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which have somewhat decreased in comparison to the previous study
* CXR showing a left apical mass, moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace opacities superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Shock: The patient is currently on maximal dose of three pressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin) due to hypotension. The cause of shock is likely multifactorial, including cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic components.
* ARDS: The patient has been intubated and paralyzed on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100%. Oxygenation is improving, but hypercarbia is still present.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a large right PE, which is being treated with heparin gtt.
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is being treated with digoxin, and the ventricular rate is being monitored.
* Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric, with a creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient is at risk for hemodialysis if aggressive care is continued.

The patient's goals of care are:

* Respiratory status: To improve oxygenation and reduce hypercarbia
* Hemodynamic status: To improve blood pressure and reduce shock
* Renal status: To improve renal function and reduce the risk of hemodialysis
* Neurological status: To improve neurological function and reduce the risk of further deterioration

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has been spiking fevers, and sepsis is a possible diagnosis.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which increases the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for further renal deterioration and may require hemodialysis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and may require further respiratory support.
* Shock: The patient is at risk for further shock, which may require additional pressors or hemodynamic support.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. The patient's goals of care are focused on improving respiratory and hemodynamic status, as well as reducing the risk of further renal deterioration and cardiac arrest."
