You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch-tall individual who was intubated from the cath lab and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition is critical, and they are receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F) to 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/61 mmHg to 94/34 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 12.7 K/uL to 11.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 275 to 237 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 to 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.31 to 0.83 ng/mL
* Glucose: 285 to 217 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right surgical pupil, left is 3mm to 2mm
* Distant heart sounds, no obvious murmur
* Diminished right and left dorsal pedal pulses
* Soft, obese abdomen
* Cool skin
* Neurological examination: unable to stand, follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count, which can indicate sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 98%, which can indicate respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, but their blood pressure is low, which can indicate cardiac instability.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which can indicate infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which can indicate renal failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is incomplete, but their inability to stand and follow simple commands can indicate neurological complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the plan should include:

* Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination
* Management of respiratory and cardiovascular instability
* Prevention of bleeding and infection
* Treatment of sepsis and renal failure
* Neurological evaluation and management
* Continuation of ICU care and close communication with the family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath found to have
   3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  Noted to have 3VD on cath at the time of transfer. ECG
   changes at presentation consistent with inferior STEMI; also with old
   anterior q-waves.
   - Discuss with family and patient (as possible) regarding CABG
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Loaded with plavix; will decide upon restarting in AM based on
   discussions with family and patient, along with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat thus far with O2 sats
   in the low 90s on 50% FiO2.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]

   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in the
   90s; will try to decrease somewhat beta-blocker.
   # PULM:  Was intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2.
   PFTs more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her
   body habitus.  She is on advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Wean off vent (down to 50% FiO2)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing oxygen saturation and was diagnosed with 3VD on cath. She has been diuresed with IV lasix and is currently receiving oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm and blood pressure of 94/61 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2. She is receiving medications including aspirin, carvedilol, simvastatin, and plavix.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's restrictive lung disease and decreased lung function may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and diastolic heart failure may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or worsening heart failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of indwelling lines and tubes may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anti-platelet agents may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of diuretics may increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may require close monitoring and adjustments to her medication regimen.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and the use of insulin may increase her risk of hypoglycemia.
8. VAP: The patient's intubation and the presence of indwelling tubes may increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. DVT: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of heparin may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-7**], new left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction is identified c/w interim ischemia.
   There appeared to be basal inferior hypokinesis on review of the prior
   study.
   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-[**Date Range 368**] (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Will start Plavix 75mg QD
   - Discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**] re: ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, but inadequate thus
   far, as continues to have large Aa gradient  with O2 sats in the mid to
   high 90s on 50% FiO2.   Requires further diuresis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her
   current level
   # IBS:  Hold outpatient regimen while NPO
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  Diuresing with IV lasix; NPO while intubated though may get tube
   feeds should she remain intubated for extended period of time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have 3-vessel disease on catheterization and was intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing oxygen saturation and PO2. She is currently being managed with medical therapy, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and diuretics, and is being considered for stenting.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, mild to moderate kidney disease, and elevated troponin levels, consistent with cardiac ischemia. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows old anterior Q-waves and inferior STEMI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung disease increases her risk of developing pulmonary edema, which can be exacerbated by the use of diuretics and PEEP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and PEEP increases her risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung injury.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac ischemia and CAD increases her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's mild to moderate kidney disease increases her risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, which can be exacerbated by the use of diuretics and other medications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of antiplatelet agents increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be exacerbated by the use of diuretics and other medications.
6. Infection: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and PEEP increases her risk of developing infection, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and PEEP increases her risk of developing venous thromboembolism, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

To prevent these potential complications, the patient's medical team should continue to monitor her closely and adjust her therapy as necessary. This may include adjusting her diuretic therapy to prevent pulmonary edema, monitoring her respiratory status closely to prevent respiratory failure, and managing her cardiac rhythm to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient's team should consider performing a stress test to evaluate her cardiac function and determine the best course of treatment."

   extubated yeterday and restarted on plavix.  She was given 40 mg of IV
   lasix once.  She became delirious overnight and was given zyprexa 5 mg
   po x1, also required restraints.  Her diet was advanced from NPO to
   regular.  On her current NPH dose her sugars were trending down
   overnight so she was given D5W 0.5 amp x2 and her NPH dose was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease, who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 119/43 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show an increase in creatinine levels, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy and diuretic therapy. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts are within normal limits, but her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Her troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial infarction.

The patient's medical conditions include coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, restrictive lung disease, and diabetes. She is taking multiple medications, including aspirin, beta-blocker, simvastatin, lisinopril, and levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and diastolic heart failure increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's restrictive lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and chronic respiratory insufficiency.
3. Renal complications: The patient's increased creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, and end-stage renal disease.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anti-platelet therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and bleeding into joints.
5. Infection complications: The patient's compromised immune system and history of chronic diseases increase her risk of infection complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and history of hypothyroidism increase her risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and thyroid dysfunction.

Based on the patient's medical history and current status, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-[**Year (4 digits) 368**] (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Will start Plavix 75mg QD
   - Discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**] re: ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, but inadequate thus
   far, as continues to have large Aa gradient  with O2 sats in the mid to
   high 90s on 50% FiO2.   Requires further diuresis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her
   current level
   # IBS:  Hold outpatient regimen while NPO
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  Diuresing with IV lasix; NPO while intubated though may get tube
   feeds should she remain intubated for extended period of time
   ACCESS: PIV's x2
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Pain managment with fentanyl
   -Bowel regimen when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Not on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] as outpatient; can discuss with primary cardiologist
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6782**]
   - Continue with IV lasix for diuresis, goal > 2 L over 24 hrs, will
   give 40mg IV now and reassess in afternoon.
   - Change Imdur to a Isosorbide Dinitrate TID.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-[**Last Name (LF) 368**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] titrate up w/ goal of 60-80.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. PFTs
   more consistent with restriction than with COPD, likely due to her body
   habitus.  Currently on PEEP of 10 w/ improved O2 sats.  Will require
   further diuresis aggressively to help w/ weaning off vent.   She is on
   advair and albuterol as an outpatient.
   - Continue with outpatient medications
   - Will decreased PEEP to 8cm this AM and reassess w ABG
   - Wean off vent as allowed by oxygen saturations, Goal > 92%.
   - Keep fentanyl on board to make pt comfortable
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH (1/2 dose) with HISS.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.
   - Follow daily Cr with expectation that she may increase from her
   current level
   # IBS:  Hold outpatient regimen while NPO
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  Diuresing with IV lasix; NPO while intubated though may get tube

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Lisinopril 5mg PO qday
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 1.5 today.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Lisinopril 5mg PO qday
   - will attempt to keep patient even to negative 500ml today
   - stop isosorbide dinitrate
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.
   - Continue with outpatient medications for COPD
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # HISTORY OF GI BLEED:  Will monitor hcts given anti-platelets given in
   cath
   # CKD:  Creatinine appears to have been below her baseline at the time
   of presentation.  Slightly up from yesterday.    Likely secondary to
   CIN and diuretics
   - will continue to monitor
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have 3VD on cath and had ECG changes consistent with inferior STEMI. She was intubated in the cath lab and was extubated after diuresis. She is currently being managed with medical therapy for her cardiac and pulmonary conditions.

The patient has been experiencing worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. She has also been experiencing diarrhea, which has been treated with hyoscyamine. She has a UTI, which has been treated with ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.5 mg/dL, which may indicate worsening renal function. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a UTI, which could lead to sepsis if not properly treated. Sepsis can cause multi-organ dysfunction and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and diastolic heart failure, which could lead to further cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has restrictive lung disease and was intubated in the cath lab, which could lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is experiencing diarrhea, which could lead to further gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
6. Infection: The patient has a UTI and is at risk for developing other infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and wound infections.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which could lead to further complications such as decreased cardiac function, decreased cognitive function, and decreased immune function.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   -stop Lisinopril 5mg PO qday given worsening renal function
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 2.2, likely secondary to ATN with poor urine output.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - stop Lisinopril
   - will attempt to diurese with 5 Zaroxyln followed by 120 IV Lasix.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # RENAL DYSFUCTION: Creatinine up to 2.2 today.  Likely secondary to
   contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 3 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  Developing oliguric/aneuric renal
   failure.
   - check urine lytes, spin urine for casts
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - diurese as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease, who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have 3VD on cath and was diagnosed with inferior STEMI. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.9°C (98.5°F), Heart rate 85 bpm, Blood pressure 97/67 mmHg, Respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient is awake and interactive, oriented to person only, with sclera anicteric, right surgical pupil, and left 3mm to 2mm. She has bilateral crackles and wheezes in the lungs, and 1+ lower extremity edema.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 12.7, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, platelet count of 275, and creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. She also has elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial damage.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Coronary artery disease with 3VD on cath
* Diastolic heart failure
* Restrictive lung disease
* Hypothyroidism
* Diabetes
* Renal dysfunction
* Peripheral neuropathy
* History of radiation s/p uterine cancer

The patient is currently receiving medical management for her conditions, including aspirin, beta-blocker, simvastatin, Plavix, and diuretics. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT and bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening renal dysfunction and potential need for dialysis
* Prolonged oliguric/aneuric renal failure
* Development of sepsis or UTI due to indwelling urinary catheter
* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or seizures
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation
* Infections, such as pneumonia or UTI, due to immunosuppression

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   -stop Lisinopril 5mg PO qday given worsening renal function
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 2.2, likely secondary to ATN with poor urine output.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - stop Lisinopril
   - will attempt to diurese with 5 Zaroxyln followed by 120 IV Lasix.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # RENAL DYSFUCTION: Creatinine up to 2.2 today.  Likely secondary to
   contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 3 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  Developing oliguric/aneuric renal
   failure.
   - check urine lytes, spin urine for casts
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - diurese as above
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes as needed

   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.

   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese as above
   - check CXR
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese as above
   - check CXR
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.8 L negative.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and underwent catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD. The patient has developed oliguric renal failure, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy, and has a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL.

The patient is currently receiving medical management for her cardiac condition, including aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

The patient's respiratory status is worsening, requiring higher O2 requirements, and she is not making urine, likely secondary to ATN from contrast. She has a positive UA and urine cultures growing out enterococcus, and has been switched to amoxicillin.

The patient's cardiac condition is being managed with carvedilol, and her diastolic CHF is being treated with diuresis. She has a history of chronic diastolic CHF and is at risk for further decompensation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and she is at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac decompensation: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic CHF and is at risk for further decompensation, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a positive UA and urine cultures growing out enterococcus, and is at risk for developing sepsis.
5. Volume overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, and is at risk for developing volume overload, which could lead to further cardiac decompensation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   -stop Lisinopril 5mg PO qday given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient was oliguirc overnight,
   however he UOP was picking up this am.
   - check urine lytes, spin urine for casts
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - diurese as above
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 2.2, likely secondary to ATN with poor urine output.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - stop Lisinopril
   - will attempt to diurese with 5 Zaroxyln followed by 120 IV Lasix.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and underwent catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD. She has developed oliguric renal failure, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy, and is receiving diuretic therapy. Her creatinine has increased to 2.8 mg/dL, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. She has also developed worsening pulmonary status, requiring higher oxygen requirements and is not making urine, likely secondary to ATN from contrast. Her cardiac diet is being managed, and she is receiving levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine has increased to 2.8 mg/dL, and she is at risk of developing further kidney damage.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguric renal failure and worsening pulmonary status may be indicative of ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary status may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic heart failure puts her at risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Sepsis: The patient's oliguric renal failure and worsening pulmonary status may increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus may lead to metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which can be life-threatening.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of restrictive lung disease and diastolic heart failure may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea, which can lead to malnutrition and dehydration.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
2. Continue prophylactic antibiotics to prevent sepsis.
3. Manage the patient's cardiac diet and provide education on cardiac rehabilitation.
4. Monitor the patient's pulmonary status closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist or cardiologist to further manage the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath found to
   have 3VD on cath.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, beta-blocker (carvedilol), simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   -stop Lisinopril 5mg PO qday given worsening renal function
   # PUMP:  Known to have diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   consistent with overload.  Has diuresed somewhat, and creatinine
   increased to 2.2, likely secondary to ATN with poor urine output.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - stop Lisinopril
   - will attempt to diurese with 5 Zaroxyln followed by 120 IV Lasix.
   # RHYTHM:  Some periods of sinus tachycardia with current rate in 60 -
   90s; will continue beta-blocker.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese with Zaroxyln 5mg + 120mg IV Lasix
   - check CXR and PM lytes
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # RENAL DYSFUCTION: Creatinine up to 2.2 today.  Likely secondary to
   contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 3 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  Developing oliguric/aneuric renal
   failure.
   - check urine lytes, spin urine for casts
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - diurese as above
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes as needed

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have 3VD on cath and was intubated in the cath lab. She was extubated after diuresis and is currently being managed for worsening pulmonary status, oliguric/aneuric renal failure, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.8, and she is developing oliguric/aneuric renal failure, which may be secondary to CIN given the significant dye load during the catheterization procedure.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's worsening renal function and low urine output may indicate ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease if left untreated.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is complicated by 3VD, diastolic heart failure, and cardiac dysfunction, which may increase the risk of cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's worsening pulmonary status, requiring higher O2 requirements, may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death if left untreated.
5. Sepsis: The patient's positive UA for leukocytes, WBCs, and bacteria may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if left untreated.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
7. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's use of SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of VTE, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death if left untreated.

Based on the patient's complex medical status, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential medical complications."

   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.5  today (from 3.0).  Likely
   secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days
   post-cath and patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not
   respond to metolazone/lasix 80 mg bolus and yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  This am,
   however her urine output began to pick up this morning, will continue
   the lasix drip.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will continue the lasix gtt
   while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.
   - Attempt to diurese as above and continue monitoring O2 sats
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.2 L negative.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Holding Lisinopril as above.
   - will attempt to diurese as above.
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.5  today (from 3.0).  Likely
   secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days
   post-cath and patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not
   respond to metolazone/lasix 80 mg bolus and yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  This am,
   however her urine output began to pick up this morning, will continue
   the lasix drip.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will continue the lasix gtt
   while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.
   - Attempt to diurese as above and continue monitoring O2 sats
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.2 L negative.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Holding Lisinopril as above.
   - will attempt to diurese as above.
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, ultimately diagnosed with a STEMI. The patient underwent catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with post-PCI balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-LAD.

The patient has developed acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy, with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL. Despite attempts to diurese with metolazone and lasix, the patient's urine output has remained low. The patient has also developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus, for which she was switched from ceftriaxone to amoxicillin.

The patient has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on oxygen therapy with a saturation level of 93% on 5L. Her respiratory status is stable, and a chest X-ray taken this morning does not show any change.

The patient has a history of chronic diastolic CHF, and her cardiac status is being managed with carvedilol and holding lisinopril due to worsening renal function. She also has a history of hypothyroidism, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Progressive kidney injury and potential need for dialysis
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the UTI
3. Respiratory failure requiring re-intubation
4. Cardiac arrhythmias or worsening heart failure
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction due to the cardiac diet and potential electrolyte imbalances
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobilization and underlying cardiovascular disease
7. Infection or sepsis due to the PICC line or other invasive devices
8. Electrolyte imbalances or hypocalcemia due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and potential diuretic use
9. Worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese as above
   - check CXR
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.8 L negative.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Holding Lisinopril as above.
   - will attempt to diurese as above.
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI. She had a catheterization and percutaneous intervention (POBA) to the mid-LAD. Her coronary arteries showed 3VD on cath, and she had ECG changes consistent with inferior STEMI and old anterior q-waves. She is currently intubated and extubated, with stable oxygen saturation in the low 90s on 5L of oxygen. Her urine output has been low, and her creatinine has risen to 3.5 mg/dL. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy, and is being treated with a lasix drip. She also has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus and is being treated with amoxicillin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure (ARF) due to contrast-induced nephropathy, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential need for dialysis.
2. Worsening of cardiac function due to decreased urine output and increased creatinine, which may lead to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and mortality.
3. Respiratory failure due to decreased lung function, which may lead to the need for mechanical ventilation and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Infection due to the positive urine culture, which may lead to sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte imbalances due to the use of diuretics and potential need for dialysis, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Hypothyroidism, which may lead to fatigue, weight gain, and potential cardiovascular complications.
7. Diabetes, which may lead to hyperglycemia and potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.5  today (from 3.0).  Likely
   secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days
   post-cath and patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not
   respond to metolazone/lasix 80 mg bolus and yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  This am,
   however her urine output began to pick up this morning, will continue
   the lasix drip.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will continue the lasix gtt
   while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   .
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.
   - Attempt to diurese as above and continue monitoring O2 sats
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.2 L negative.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Holding Lisinopril as above.
   - will attempt to diurese as above.
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and was treated with catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD. She developed acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy. Despite treatment with metolazone and lasix, her urine output remained low, but increased this morning. She is currently receiving lasix and will continue to be monitored for resolution over the next few days. The patient is also being treated for coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease, and urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.5 mg/dL, and her urine output is still low. If not managed properly, this could lead to further decline in renal function and potential need for dialysis.
2. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy. If not managed properly, this could lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and diastolic heart failure, and is currently being treated for coronary artery disease. If not managed properly, this could lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is being treated for pulmonary disease and has a history of COPD. If not managed properly, this could lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection and is being treated with antibiotics. If not managed properly, this could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or kidney damage.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine. If not managed properly, this could lead to further complications, such as hypothyroid crisis.
7. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes and is being treated with insulin. If not managed properly, this could lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Continues to have low uop on Lasix gtt and creatinine continues to
   rise.  Yesterday morning ([**11-12**]) had 250ml output, but minimal after
   this. Renal recommended checking complement levels.  PT evaluated
   patient yesterday.  Lasix gtt stopped at 9pm because it was not
   helping.

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 4.2 today.  Likely ATN.
   Unclear if this will resolve but trial of RRT may improve creatinine.
   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now in oliguric renal failure.
   - Discuss with family regarding dialysis
   - F/U with renal today.  Pt will need line placement and start HD
   ?tomorrow vs. today if family amenable
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend creatinine and hope for improvement.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   .
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Sats are stable in the low 90
s on 5L.   CXR
   this am does not show any change.  Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   from CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix.
   - HD as per above for fluid removal
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   ampicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac renal diet, replete lytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIV's x2; will have a PICC placed for long term IV access
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full code.  Discussed with family.
   DISPO: unit for now given renal dysfunction<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who had a STEMI and was treated with catheterization and percutaneous coronary balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-LAD.

The patient's current condition is:

* Renal failure: Creatinine has risen to 4.2 mg/dL, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is oliguric and not responsive to diuretics.
* Coronaries: 3-vessel disease on catheterization, with ECG changes consistent with inferior STEMI and old anterior q-waves. Medical management is being continued for now, with the possibility of stenting in the future.
* Pulmonary: Intubated in the cath lab due to decreasing sats and pO2, but now extubated after diuresis. Sats are stable in the low 90s on 5L. CXR shows no change, likely due to pulmonary edema from CHF.
* UTI: Patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus, and is being treated with Augmentin for 5 days.
* Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm.
* Diabetes: Patient is being treated with home NPH with HISS and will have blood sugars monitored.
* Hypothyroidism: Patient is being continued on levothyroxine.
* FEN: Patient is on a cardiac renal diet and will have electrolytes repleted as needed.
* ACCESS: Patient has two PIVs and will have a PICC placed for long-term IV access.
* PROPHYLAXIS: Patient is receiving SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and bowel regimen.
* CODE: Full code, discussed with family.
* DISPO: Patient will remain in the unit for now due to renal dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening renal failure, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload
* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and decreased lung function
* Sepsis or bacteremia due to the UTI
* Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's underlying cardiac conditions
* Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, due to the patient's kidney dysfunction
* Fluid overload or congestive heart failure due to the patient's cardiac and pulmonary conditions."

   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now with increasing UOP (made 1.3 cc
   of urine yesterday).
   - Appreciated renal consult, with f/u recs.
   - Continue calcium acetate, and AlOH
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.   No recent
   episodes of CP.
   - Continue aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given ARF
   .
   # PULM:  Patient was intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats
   and pO2. Now extubated many days ago after diuresis.  Sats are stable
   in the low 90
s on 5L.     Likely secondary to pulmonary edema from
   CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix given her ARF.
   - Continue monitoring.
   - Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn
   - As her UOP is picking up, she is unlikely to need HD for fluid
   removal.
   # ANEMIA: The patient had a Hct drop of 29.7 to 26.4 today.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Will guaiac her stools.
   - Continue to trend; repeat Hct today.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   amoxicillin, however this was switched to augmentin as she continued to
   be febrile on amoxicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Low back pain: Patient has chronic low back pain.
   - Will change Oxycodone to standing 5 mg q6h and discuss with her

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD with ARF.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 4.2 today.  Likely ATN.
   Unclear if this will resolve but trial of RRT may improve creatinine.
   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now with increasing UOP (made 1.3 cc
   of urine yesterday).
   - Appreciated renal consult, with f/u recs.
   - Continue calcium acetate, and AlOH
   - Continue holding her acei
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.   No recent
   episodes of CP.
   - Continue aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given ARF
   .
   # PULM:  Patient was intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats
   and pO2. Now extubated many days ago after diuresis.  Sats are stable
   in the low 90
s on 5L.     Likely secondary to pulmonary edema from
   CHF, unable to diurese with Lasix given her ARF.
   - Continue monitoring.
   - Albuterol and Atrovent nebs prn
   - As her UOP is picking up, she is unlikely to need HD for fluid
   removal.
   # ANEMIA: The patient had a Hct drop of 29.7 to 26.4 today.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Will guaiac her stools.
   - Continue to trend; repeat Hct today.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone, then changed to
   amoxicillin, however this was switched to augmentin as she continued to
   be febrile on amoxicillin.
   - Augmentin X 5 days (day # 1 [**2140-11-13**])
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Low back pain: Patient has chronic low back pain.
   - Will change Oxycodone to standing 5 mg q6h and discuss with her
   family possibly adding on oxycontin.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who had a STEMI and was treated with catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD with acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with a SpO2 of 92%. She has bilateral crackles on lung examination and a 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the LUSB.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 76 bpm and a blood pressure of 114/39 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has ARF with a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL and is on diuretics. She is producing urine, but the amount is not specified.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.7%.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of chronic low back pain and is taking oxycodone for pain management.
* Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus and is being treated with augmentin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's ARF and potential underlying kidney disease.
* Heart failure exacerbation due to the patient's underlying heart disease and potential fluid overload.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic lung disease and potential fluid overload.
* Infection due to the patient's positive urine culture and potential underlying urinary tract infection.
* Anemia due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and potential blood loss.
* Hypothyroidism due to the patient's underlying thyroid disease and potential medication changes.
* Diabetes due to the patient's underlying diabetes and potential medication changes.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing diuretics and adjusting as needed to manage fluid overload.
* Continuing antibiotics for the patient's urinary tract infection.
* Monitoring the patient's kidney function and adjusting medication as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's blood sugar levels and adjusting medication as needed.
* Continuing to manage the patient's pain with oxycodone and considering adding oxycontin.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjusting medication as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and was treated with catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (POBA) to the mid-LAD with acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently in oliguric renal failure and has a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac failure. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 92% on 5L of oxygen. The patient's neurological status is normal, with no signs of neurological deficits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 3.7 mg/dL, indicating ongoing ARF. The patient's kidney function may continue to decline, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the patient's history of CAD and diastolic heart failure puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's history of restrictive lung disease and pulmonary edema from CHF puts her at risk for further pulmonary complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Infection: The patient's urine culture grew out enterococcus, and the patient is currently receiving antibiotics. The patient is at risk for further infections, particularly in the urinary tract, lungs, and bloodstream.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is receiving levothyroxine. The patient's thyroid function should be monitored closely to ensure that the patient is receiving adequate treatment.
6. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes and is receiving insulin therapy. The patient's blood sugar levels should be monitored closely to ensure that the patient is receiving adequate treatment.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and the patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider the use of dialysis to improve the patient's kidney function.
9. Consider the use of cardiac medications to improve the patient's cardiac status.
10. Consider the use of respiratory medications to improve the patient's respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD with ARF.
   24 Hour Events:
   Off Lasix gtt.  Per renal no indication for HD.  Uosm 294, consistent
   w/ ATN. PM lytes wnl, Cr improved to 3.7, U/O improving.  Continuing to
   hold diuretics.  Continued further w/ AlOH per renal, who will help us
   decide when to d/c or switch over to an alternate [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Changed Amoxicillin to Augmentin as she was still febrile during the
   day, if this continues, may need to change to ampicillin
   x3d.  Complement levels pending.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, dizziness.  Admits to [**7-17**] lower

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who had a STEMI and underwent catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD with acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy with a SpO2 of 92%. She has bilateral crackles on lung examination.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD and diastolic heart failure. She has a 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the LUSB.
3. Renal: The patient has ARF with a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL. She is on diuretics, but her urine output is improving.
4. Infectious: The patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus and is currently on Augmentin.
5. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes and is on home NPH with HISS. She also has hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine.
6. Pain: The patient has chronic low back pain and is on oxycodone prn.
7. Laboratory Results:
	* WBC: 12.4
	* Hct: 33.0
	* Plt: 220
	* Cr: 3.7 mg/dL
	* TCO2: 30
	* Glucose: 133 mg/dL
	* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 12.8 / 29.6 / 1.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 133 / 13 / 0.83, ALT / AST: 19 / 0.6, Alk Phos / T Bili: 102 / 0.6, Amylase / Lipase: 20 / 0.6, Differential-Neuts: 65.7%, Lymph: 23.8%, Mono: 6.8%, Eos: 3.6%, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.7 g/dL, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 6.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her restrictive lung disease and pulmonary edema.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus, and there is a risk of sepsis developing.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and diastolic heart failure, and there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to her immobilization and the presence of central venous catheters.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture, and there is a risk of developing further infections.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is low, and there is a risk of malnutrition developing.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Renal consult for further evaluation and management of acute kidney injury.
2. Continue diuretics and monitor urine output.
3. Continue calcium acetate and AlOH.
4. Continue holding ACEI.
5. Continue to trend Cr.
6. Renally dose meds.
7. Continue monitoring for respiratory failure and sepsis.
8. Continue to manage pain with oxycodone prn.
9. Continue to monitor for cardiac complications.
10. Continue to monitor for thromboembolic events and infection.
11. Continue to monitor for malnutrition and provide nutritional support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease. She had a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty (POBA) to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is oliguric and not responsive to diuretics. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, and is currently taking medications for these conditions, including aspirin, carvedilol, simvastatin, and lisinopril. She is also taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient's physical examination reveals a trace of lower extremity edema, and her lung examination shows bilateral crackles with decreased breath sounds at the bases. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no rebound or guarding.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.4 K/uL, a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.2 g/dL, and a platelet count (PLT) of 220 K/uL. Her serum creatinine (Cr) level is 3.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 76 beats per minute (bpm), and a blood pressure of 114/39 mmHg.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level is currently 3.7 mg/dL, and she is oliguric, which increases the risk of further kidney damage.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone PCI, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of restrictive lung disease and is currently experiencing bilateral crackles with decreased breath sounds at the bases, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus, which increases the risk of urinary tract infection and sepsis.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance due to her kidney dysfunction and the use of diuretics.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. It is essential to closely monitor her condition and manage her medications and treatments carefully to prevent further complications."

   A renal US showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.
   Not responsive to diuretics.  Pt now with increasing UOP (made 1.3 cc
   of urine yesterday).

   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting in the future.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD with ARF.
   24 Hour Events:
   Off Lasix gtt.  Per renal no indication for HD.  Uosm 294, consistent
   w/ ATN. PM lytes wnl, Cr improved to 3.7, U/O improving.  Continuing to
   hold diuretics.  Continued further w/ AlOH per renal, who will help us
   decide when to d/c or switch over to an alternate [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Changed Amoxicillin to Augmentin as she was still febrile during the
   day, if this continues, may need to change to ampicillin
   x3d.  Complement levels pending.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, dizziness.  Admits to [**7-17**] lower

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and restrictive lung disease who presented with a STEMI and was treated with catheterization and POBA to the mid-LAD. She developed acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level up to 4.2 today, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's current condition is stable, with a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL, and her urine output is improving. She is receiving diuretics and calcium acetate, and her electrolytes are being monitored. Her cardiac status is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm, and her pulmonary function is stable, with a SpO2 of 92% on 5L of oxygen.

The patient has a few potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and her urine output is improving slowly. If her creatinine level continues to rise or her urine output does not improve, she may require more aggressive treatment, such as hemodialysis.
2. Development of sepsis: The patient has a positive urine culture growing out enterococcus, and she is being treated with augmentin. If her infection is not effectively treated, she may develop sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her thyroid function should be monitored regularly to ensure that her thyroid hormone levels are within a normal range.
4. Low back pain: The patient has chronic low back pain, and she is being treated with oxycodone as needed. If her pain is not effectively managed, she may develop chronic pain syndrome.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of restrictive lung disease, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure. If her oxygen saturation levels drop or she experiences shortness of breath, she may require mechanical ventilation.

In summary, the patient's condition is stable, but she has a few potential medical complications that can arise. Her creatinine level and urine output should be closely monitored, and her infection should be effectively treated to prevent sepsis. Her thyroid function should be regularly monitored, and her low back pain should be managed effectively to prevent chronic pain syndrome."
