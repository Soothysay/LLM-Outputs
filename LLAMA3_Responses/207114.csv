You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain radiating to the back. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which he had an ablation procedure today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient has a pericardial drain in place with 100cc of output since arrival to the ICU, and a repeat ECHO showed resolution of the effusion. He has a history of cardiac tamponade, and the patient is at risk for pericarditis.

The patient's lab results show mild elevation of troponin-T and creatinine, but his kidney function is otherwise normal. His cardiac enzymes are normal, and his ECG shows sinus rhythm with diffuse ST segment elevations.

The patient's plan includes repeat ECHO this morning, followed by extubation if the effusion is stable. He will also be monitored for serial CRITs, and his pericardial drain output will be followed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pericarditis: The patient has a history of cardiac tamponade and is at risk for pericarditis, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and the ablation procedure may not have completely resolved the arrhythmia.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which can increase his risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly with the pericardial drain in place and the use of invasive lines and tubes.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, complicated by presumed atrial fibrillation, and underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab with approximately 1L of oxygenated blood expressed. The patient has been receiving fluid resuscitation overnight to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C, Heart rate 89 bpm, Blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, Respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 100%.
* Physical examination: The patient appears well-nourished and has no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals a rub, and peripheral vascular examination reveals absent radial pulses on both sides.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin is 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count is 261 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.06 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was treated with an ablation procedure today. The patient has also undergone pericardiocentesis and has a pericardial drain in place.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac tamponade: The patient has already undergone pericardiocentesis and has a pericardial drain in place, but there is a risk of recurrent tamponade.
* Pericarditis: The patient has symptoms of pericardial irritation, including chest pain, and has evidence of pericarditis on EKG.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and may be at risk for lipid-related complications.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for recurrent atrial fibrillation.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, which may be related to fluid resuscitation or cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat ECHO this morning to assess for effusion and cardiac function.
* If the effusion is stable, extubate the patient after ECHO.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust fluid resuscitation as necessary.
* Check serial CRITs to monitor the patient's cardiac function.
* Follow the patient's pericardial drain output and adjust the drain as necessary.
* Restart Lipitor when the patient is taking oral medications.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust as necessary.
* Consider restarting antihypertensive medications when the patient is taking oral medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient was extubated without difficulty and had a stable hemodynamic profile. The repeat TTE showed a slightly enlarged pocket of fluid (1/3 cm) anterior to the RV without tamponade physiology. The fluid was inflammatory and straw-colored, with a total drain output of 350cc, mostly by passive drainage. The patient's Hct remained stable.

The patient was restarted on diltiazem and propafenone, with a dose increase to 60mg in the morning. They also received colchicine for pain relief due to pericarditic pain.

The patient's vital signs remained stable, with a heart rate of 78-119 bpm, blood pressure of 107/52-123/91 mmHg, and SpO2 of 95%. They were on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's physical examination revealed a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with a normal S1 and S2. They had a distant HS and a +friction rub.

The patient's lab results showed:

* WBC: 11.0-12.0 K/uL
* Hct: 28.2-32.0%
* Plt: 200-261 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0-1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.06 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22-28 mmHg
* Glucose: 111-185 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies showed:

* TTE: Normal left ventricular systolic function with a small pericardial effusion (1.3 cm) and no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Cardiac tamponade: Although the patient's effusion has stabilized, there is still a small pocket of fluid that could potentially cause tamponade.
* Pericarditis: The patient's pericarditic pain and inflammatory fluid could lead to further complications, such as pericardial effusion or tamponade.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to complications such as cardiac failure, stroke, or kidney damage.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia could lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, pancreatitis, or kidney disease.
* Arrhythmias: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could lead to further complications, such as stroke or cardiac failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to address these potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac tamponade following a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab, which resulted in the removal of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (72-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/52 mmHg (66-123/91 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a small pericardial effusion (1.3cm) and no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%).

The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), which is being managed with diltiazem and propafenone. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and Coumadin/heparin therapy has been held to prevent oozing at the perforation site.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.0-12.0 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.0-30.9%
* Platelet count: 200-261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0-1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22-28 mmHg
* Glucose: 111-185 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: Despite the patient's stable cardiac status, there is still a small pericardial effusion present, which could potentially worsen and lead to cardiac tamponade.
2. Pericarditis: The patient is experiencing mild symptoms of pericarditis, which could worsen and lead to increased pain and inflammation.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with medication, but it could potentially worsen and lead to increased risk of stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, but it could potentially worsen and lead to increased risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with medication, but it could potentially worsen and lead to increased risk of cardiovascular events.

In summary, the patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac tamponade following a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there are still potential medical complications that could arise, including cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with cardiac tamponade due to a pericardial effusion. He underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab, which resulted in the removal of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood. The patient's cardiac tamponade has resolved, and he is now being monitored for any signs of tamponade or continued bleeding from the pericardial drain. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the pericardial drain: The patient's pericardial drain output has decreased, but it is still possible that he may continue to bleed from the drain.
2. Tamponade: Although the patient's cardiac tamponade has resolved, it is still possible that he may develop tamponade again if the pericardial drain becomes blocked or if there is continued bleeding from the drain.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated, but it is possible that he may develop atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia instead.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being monitored, but it is possible that he may develop hypertension again if his antihypertensive medications are not effective.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being treated, but it is possible that he may develop hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia instead.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac function is being monitored, but it is possible that he may develop cardiac failure if his heart function declines.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is being monitored, but it is possible that he may develop respiratory failure if his lung function declines.
8. Sepsis: The patient's infection risk is being monitored, but it is possible that he may develop sepsis if he develops an infection.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including continued bleeding from the pericardial drain, tamponade, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade due to pulmonary vein isolation complicated by presumed pericarditis. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab and had approximately 1L of oxygenated blood expressed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 90%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is intubated and sedated, with a cardiac output of 3.7 L/min and a mean arterial pressure of 77 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,105 mL of fluid, including 930 mL of intravenous fluids, 175 mL of total parenteral nutrition, and 180 mL of drain output. The patient has lost a total of 5,310 mL of fluid, including 5,130 mL of urine and 180 mL of drain output.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 inspirations per minute.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count is 200 x 10^9/L. The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was terminated early due to a cardiac ablation procedure. The patient has also had a previous stress test that showed no evidence of ischemia.

The patient's current medications include colchicine, diltiazem, and propafenone. The patient is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with subtherapeutic INR 1.8.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac tamponade is likely to persist due to the presence of a small remaining pocket of fluid.
* Pericarditis: The patient's pericarditis may worsen due to the presence of a small remaining pocket of fluid and the patient's ongoing inflammatory response.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist due to the presence of underlying cardiac disease and the patient's ongoing inflammatory response.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the patient's ongoing inflammatory response.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen due to the patient's ongoing inflammatory response and the patient's underlying cardiac disease.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the patient's plan of care should include:

* Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac tamponade and pericarditis, with repeat echocardiograms and pericardial drain output monitoring.
* Ongoing treatment with colchicine, diltiazem, and propafenone.
* Prophylactic anticoagulation with subtherapeutic INR 1.8.
* Close monitoring of the patient's atrial fibrillation, with consideration of cardioversion or atrial flutter ablation.
* Close monitoring of the patient's hypertension, with consideration of antihypertensive therapy.
* Close monitoring of the patient's hyperlipidemia, with consideration of lipid-lowering therapy.
* Ongoing nutrition and glycemic control, with consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade due to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's cardiac function is stable, with an ejection fraction of 60% on echocardiogram. The patient has mild mitral regurgitation and a small remaining pocket of fluid in the pericardial cavity.

The patient's rhythm is unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The patient is being treated with diltiazem and propafenone to control the rhythm.

The patient has bibasilar atelectasis and left-sided pleural effusion, which is being treated with guaifenesin and codeine. The patient has decreased appetite and is receiving regular diet.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with a potassium level of 3.7 mmol/L and a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac tamponade is stable, but the patient is at risk for re-accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is unstable and may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac function.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with medication, but the patient is at risk for hypertension-related complications such as cardiac failure and stroke.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with statin therapy, but the patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's bibasilar atelectasis and left-sided pleural effusion may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's decreased appetite and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as malnutrition and bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's intubation and immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Pulmonary vein isolation complicated by presumed
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3429**]. s/p pericardiocentesis in the EP lab with approx 1L of
   oxygenated blood expressed. Repeat ECHOs show stabilization of effusion
   (small). Pt with mild sx of pericarditis. BP stable without need for
   pressors or fluid boluses post-extubation, doing well. Drain output
   substantiantially decreased today. Hematocrit stable.
   - Formal ECHO
   - Remove pericardial drain given low output
   - Discontinue colchicine
   - Consider restarting Coumadin today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known hx of CAD - last stress test [**2190**] (OSH) per
   report showed no evidence of ischemia. Risk factors include
   hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Cont. statin. Check lipid panel.
   .
   # PUMP:  ECHO [**6-9**] showed nl PUMP function with EF 60%, Cardiac MR
   [**1-9**] showed LVEF 65% and nl wall motion. Mild MR. ECHO in EP lab
   showed evidence of tamponade and RV collapse (resolved on repeat).
   Subsequent ECHOs show resolution, with small remaining pocket of fluid.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Known paroxysmal Afib, s/p ablation procedure which was
   terminated early. Sinus rhythm post procedure, but back in Afib [**1-25**].
   Conversion to atrial flutter with rates to 130s on [**1-26**]. Now in and
   out of atrial fibrillation with rates in 70-80s.

Summary:

The patient is a 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with cardiac tamponade due to a pericardial effusion. He underwent pericardiocentesis and has since been stabilized. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 70-80s and has been experiencing mild symptoms of pericarditis. His vital signs are stable, and he has been receiving treatment with diltiazem and propafenone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion has resolved, but there is still a small remaining pocket of fluid. This could lead to further complications if not monitored closely.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is ongoing, and he is at risk for further complications such as stroke or embolism.
3. Pericarditis: The patient's mild symptoms of pericarditis could worsen if not treated appropriately.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with diltiazem, but it is essential to monitor his blood pressure closely to prevent further complications.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with Lipitor, but it is crucial to monitor his lipid levels to prevent further complications.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusion could lead to respiratory complications if not treated appropriately.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, but there is a risk of fluid overload if not managed carefully.
8. Wound Infection: The patient's pericardial drain site could be at risk for infection if not monitored closely.
9. Sepsis: The patient's underlying conditions, such as cardiac tamponade and pericarditis, could lead to sepsis if not managed appropriately.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pericardial effusion and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and propafenone.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent further complications.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hyperlipidemia with Lipitor.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely to prevent further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely to prevent fluid overload.
7. Monitor the patient's wound site closely to prevent infection.
8. Monitor the patient's overall condition closely for signs of sepsis."
