   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Now weaned off
   sedation, on 5 peep, 5 pressure support. Good RSBI and tolerating SBT.
   - plan for extubation pending CXR
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks (likely wearing off today), fentanyl
   boluses per surgery; zofran for nausea
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   -          Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event
   patient becomes septic.
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, who developed a leak around the anastomosis and was taken to the operating room. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.6°F
* Tachycardic: 136 bpm
* Shortness of breath
* Leukocytosis: 16.9 K/uL
* Tachypnea
* Hypertension: initially marked, now improved
* Abdominal distension
* Large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis
* Prominent vessels with possible overhydration

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Antibiotics: vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Pain control: fentanyl, propofol
* Sedation: propofol
* Prophylaxis: heparin, PPI
* Nutrition: NPO, lytes prn, bolus IVF prn
* Glycemic control: insulin drip

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* WBC: 11.5, 16.9
* Hct: 33.4, 36.9
* Plt: 298, 324
* Cr: 0.9, 1.1
* TCO2: 26, 29
* Glucose: 151, 139

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to tachypnea, discomfort, and splinting from pain, abdominal distension, and possible overhydration.
2. Sepsis: due to intra-abdominal infection, monitored by fever curve, WBC trend, lactate, urine output, and BP trend.
3. Leukocytosis: may be a sign of infection or inflammation.
4. Hypertension: may be secondary to discomfort, pain, or sepsis, monitored by trend and holding antihypertensives as necessary.
5. Tachycardia: may be due to poor pain control, monitored by trend and adjusting pain management as necessary.
6. Abdominal complications: such as perforation, abscess, or bleeding, monitored by abdominal distension, tenderness, and guarding.
7. Pleural effusion: may be due to sepsis or pancreatitis, monitored by chest X-ray and drainage as necessary.
8. Wound complications: such as infection, dehiscence, or bleeding, monitored by wound appearance, drainage, and pain.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: weaning off sedation, on 5 cmH2O PEEP, 5 cmH2O pressure support, and tolerating spontaneous breathing trials.
2. Antibiotic coverage: vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
3. Drain management: two drains in place for drainage after wash-out and repair.
4. Pain control: fentanyl boluses, nerve blocks, and zofran for nausea.
5. Monitoring: for sepsis, leukocytosis, and abdominal complications.
6. Follow-up: culture data, fever curve, WBC trend, lactate, urine output, and BP trend for evidence of evolving sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Currently, last ABG was
   acceptable on AC, Fi02 50% (7.42/39/153).
   - Can likely go down on FiO2 and TV
   - Propofol for sedation as hope for extubation tomrorow
   - Follow up AM CXR to monitor for any evidence of infection, fluid
   status
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks, tylenol PR, fentanyl boluses per
   surgery
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   - Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event patient
   becomes septic.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Currently, last ABG was
   acceptable on AC, Fi02 50% (7.42/39/153).
   - Can likely go down on FiO2 and TV
   - Propofol for sedation as hope for extubation tomrorow
   - Follow up AM CXR to monitor for any evidence of infection, fluid
   status
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks, tylenol PR, fentanyl boluses per
   surgery
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   - Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event patient
   becomes septic.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old male who underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis. He was taken to the operating room today for a leak around the anastomosis and is now being managed in the ICU. The patient remains intubated and is receiving respiratory support. He has fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia.

The patient has a significant risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea is likely multifactorial, including discomfort, pain, and abdominal distension. He may require weaning off respiratory support in the near future.
2. Sigmoid diverticulitis: The patient has a known leak around the anastomosis and is at risk of developing intra-abdominal infection. Monitoring for other possible sites of infection, such as blood, urine, and pneumonia, is crucial.
3. Leukocytosis and fevers: The patient's leukocytosis and fevers are likely related to the intra-abdominal infection. Monitoring for evidence of evolving sepsis, including lactate, urine output, and blood pressure, is essential.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely related to discomfort and has improved with propofol sedation. Monitoring for trends and holding antihypertensives as needed is necessary.
5. Potential for bleeding: The patient has a known leak around the anastomosis, which increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Potential for wound complications: The patient has undergone surgery and is at risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Now weaned off
   sedation, on 5 peep, 5 pressure support. Good RSBI and tolerating SBT.
   - plan for extubation pending CXR
   .
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks (likely wearing off today), fentanyl
   boluses per surgery; zofran for nausea
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   -          Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event
   patient becomes septic.
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was kept intubated due to tachypnea
   post-operatively. Suspect this is multifactorial, but large role may be
   due to discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension. He
   also had a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and
   prominent vessels with possible over hydration. Now weaned off
   sedation, on 5 peep, 5 pressure support. Good RSBI and tolerating SBT.
   - plan for extubation pending CXR

   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with nerve blocks (likely wearing off today), fentanyl
   boluses per surgery; zofran for nausea
   .
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   .
   #) Hypertension: Initially was markedly hypertensive upon arrival to
   ICU, suspect this was secondary to discomfort. Has improved markedly
   after placement on propofol (SBP 120-130).
   -          Monitor trend, holding antihypertensives at present in event
   patient becomes septic.
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, who was taken to the OR today for a leak around the anastomosis and is now being managed in the ICU. He is intubated and has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. The patient has a large pleural effusion with probable atelectasis and prominent vessels with possible overhydration. He is receiving antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea may be multifactorial, including discomfort and splinting from pain, abdominal distension, and possible atelectasis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a known leak and observed fecal material in the peritoneum, making intra-abdominal infection a possible source of sepsis. Monitoring for other possible sites of infection and evidence of evolving sepsis is essential.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be secondary to discomfort, and monitoring for a trend is necessary. Holding antihypertensives for now, in case the patient becomes septic.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent sinus tachycardia may be due to poor pain control, and further management of pain is necessary.
5. Abdominal Complications: The patient has a large pleural effusion and possible atelectasis, which may require further management, including drainage and possible chest tube placement.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a large amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient has a known leak and possible intra-abdominal infection, which may require further management, including antibiotic coverage and possible surgical intervention.
8. Pain Management: The patient's pain control may be inadequate, which may lead to further complications, including tachycardia and hypertension.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent surgery and possible intra-abdominal infection may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including nausea and vomiting.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and possible myocardial infarction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 43 year old male with recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis
   status-post laproscopic sigmoid colectomy, with fevers, leukocytosis,
   shortness of breath, and tachycardia, taken to the OR today for leak
   around anastamosis, now transfered to ICU for further management,
   remaining intubated.
   #) Respiratory failure: Extubated without difficulty
   #) Sigmoid diverticulitis s/p lap sigmoidectomy and exploratory
   laporatory for leak ([**3-2**]): Two drains in place today for drainage
   after wash-out and repair.
   - Appreciate surgical co-management
   - Antibiotic coverage as noted below
   - Further drain, ostomy management per surgery
   - Pain control with morphine IV, start PCA today as more awake
   #) Leukocytosis, fevers: Most likely source is intra-abdominal given
   known leak and observed fecal material in peritoneum. Monitoring for
   other possible sites of infection (blood, urine, pneumonia, no
   indwelling lines). Also monitoring for any evidence of evolving sepsis.
   - On vancomycin and zosyn
   - Follow up culture data
   - Monitoring fever curve, WBC trend
   - Monitoring lactate, urine output, BP trend for evidence of evolving
   sepsis
   #) Hypertension:  Restart meds
   #) Tachycardia: persistently sinus tachy even with fluids. ? due to
   poor pain control.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis, status-post laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, who was taken to the operating room for a leak around the anastomosis and is now being managed in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.1°F, heart rate 127 bpm, blood pressure 184/86 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient is tachycardic, with no murmurs, and has a soft, diffusely tender abdomen.
* Laboratory results: The patient has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 344 K/uL, and is anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an alanine transaminase level of 14 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase level of 41 IU/L.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, particularly given the presence of a leak around the anastomosis and observed fecal material in the peritoneum.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and restarting medications may be necessary to control blood pressure.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to poor pain control, and further assessment is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Infection: The patient's anastomosis leak and observed fecal material in the peritoneum increase the risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anastomosis leak and potential for bleeding from the surgical site are potential complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and potential for sepsis increase the risk of organ dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotic coverage: The patient is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for potential intra-abdominal infection.
2. Pain control: The patient will receive morphine IV and PCA as needed for pain control.
3. Fluid management: The patient will receive IV fluids as needed to maintain hydration and blood pressure.
4. Monitoring: The patient will be monitored for signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and changes in mental status.
5. Surgical management: The patient's anastomosis leak and potential for bleeding from the surgical site will require further management and monitoring.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blockers."
