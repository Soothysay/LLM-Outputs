   HPI: 66 M with CAD s/p MI [**2172**] medically managed, CHF EF35% COPD on
   home O2 2L, DM2 on insulin, non-small cell lung cancer who presented
   with acute on chronic cholecystitis on [**2177-11-30**], now s/p open
   cholecystectomy. The following history is obtained from the medical
   record. He was originially admitted on [**11-25**] and disharged [**11-27**] with
   ?cholecystis. He was then seen in surgery clinic where it was decided
   to readmit the patient for cholecystectomy; Cipro and Flagyl were also
   started. He was seen in cardiology clinic for pre-op evaluation, where
   it was advised to hold plavix.
   .
   In the OR: The patient received cefazolin and flagyl. He also received
   hydrocortisone 100mg IV prior to surgery as he had been on prednisone
   one month ago - by had not been on it for the past month. Lap chole was
   attempted with conversion to open cholecystectomy. The case lasted 2
   hrs with minimal blood loss. Towards the end of the case his blood
   pressures dropped to SBP 90-100's, started on neo. UOP remained good at
   325cc for the whole case.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, CHF, COPD, DM2, and non-small cell lung cancer. He presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent open cholecystectomy. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU, with a diagnosis of mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction, moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.1°F, pulse of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 91% on FiO2 100%. His cardiac rhythm is AV paced.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation to maintain ventilation tonight, with a plan to change to PS and reduce FiO2
* Diuresis of 500-1 liter by morning if blood pressure permits
* Restart of tiotropium, xopenex, and pulmicort in the morning
* Hold carvedilol overnight for NPO
* 1/2 dose of home glargine at night for NPO
* Obtain EKG and hold simvastatin, ezetimibe, and carvedilol until taking PO's
* Follow-up with OSH oncologist

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with a diagnosis of mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and new volume overload on CXR. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, especially if the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, with a diagnosis of mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction. There is a risk of further cardiac compromise, especially if the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, especially given his recent surgery and his compromised immune system.
4. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding, especially given his history of bleeding complications and his current anticoagulation therapy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of further renal compromise, especially if his blood pressure is not well-controlled.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and to optimize his respiratory, cardiac, and renal status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) on insulin, and non-small cell lung cancer. The patient presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent open cholecystectomy.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 35.2°C (95.4°F)
* Heart rate: 66 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 115/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AV-paced

The patient is intubated and sedated, not arousable to voice commands. He has a history of volume overload on chest X-ray (CXR) and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation to manage this.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is only 91%. He may require further respiratory support or consideration for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation.
2. Volume overload: The patient's CXR demonstrates new volume overload, which may lead to cardiac failure or pulmonary edema.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, and he is receiving half-dose insulin at home. He may require adjustments to his insulin regimen to manage his glucose levels.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, and he has a history of MI. He may be at risk for cardiac failure, especially with the new volume overload on CXR.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, and he has a history of GI bleeding. He may be at risk for bleeding complications, especially with the use of heparin and PPI.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and may be at risk for further infection, especially with the use of antibiotics.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are low, which may indicate metabolic acidosis. He may require further evaluation and treatment to manage this.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Monitor the patient's volume overload closely and consider diuresis if his blood pressure permits.
3. Adjust the patient's insulin regimen to manage his glucose levels.
4. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's cardiac failure.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely and consider adjusting his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Evaluate the patient for further infection and consider antibiotics if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis closely and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 POSTOPERATIVE S/P OPEN CCY:  Doesn't appear to be in pain. Plan for
   pain control per medical resident's note.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACTUE ON CHRONIC:  Maintained on MV given volume
   overload in setting of underlying oxygen dependent COPD.  Diuresed with
   lasix, negative about 1L this morning.  Was tachypneic breathing in
   high 30's this morning on 12 PSV/5 PEEP, unable to assess autoPEEP in
   this setting albeit concerned for increased work of breathing with
   underlying COPD - PEEP increased to 8 (ETT 7.5), rate settled to
   mid-teens, appears much more comfortable.  Anticipate extubation later
   today once more awake.  Continue bronchodilators.  On 40 mg propofol,
   not responsive.  Need to decrease sedation,
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Tolerating diuresis this morning, known EF
   ~ 35%.  Hold on further lasix.  Repleting K/Mg. Repeat labs in the
   afternoon.  Will discuss restarting afterload reduction with surgical
   service as well as beta blocker given his blood pressure has been
   stable.
 CAD:  Holding plavix perioperatively.  On ASA.
 DIABETES:  Glargine dropped to half dose, getting RISS.  BS ~ 160's.
   NPO pending extubation and in setting of surgical status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 POSTOPERATIVE S/P OPEN CCY:  Doesn't appear to be in pain. Plan for
   pain control per medical resident's note.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACTUE ON CHRONIC:  Maintained on MV given volume
   overload in setting of underlying oxygen dependent COPD.  Diuresed with
   lasix, negative about 1L this morning.  Was tachypneic breathing in
   high 30's this morning on 12 PSV/5 PEEP, unable to assess autoPEEP in
   this setting albeit concerned for increased work of breathing with
   underlying COPD - PEEP increased to 8 (ETT 7.5), rate settled to
   mid-teens, appears much more comfortable.  Anticipate extubation later
   today once more awake.  Continue bronchodilators.  On 40 mg propofol,
   not responsive.  Need to decrease sedation,
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Tolerating diuresis this morning, known EF
   ~ 35%.  Hold on further lasix.  Repleting K/Mg. Repeat labs in the
   afternoon.  Will discuss restarting afterload reduction with surgical
   service as well as beta blocker given his blood pressure has been
   stable.
 CAD:  Holding plavix perioperatively.  On ASA.
 DIABETES:  Glargine dropped to half dose, getting RISS.  BS ~ 160's.
   NPO pending extubation and in setting of surgical status.

Summary:

The patient is a post-operative patient with respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 700 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient has been diuresed with lasix, with a negative fluid balance of 1L over the past 24 hours. They are receiving propofol for sedation and fentanyl for pain control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 143/56 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 36 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 99% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), which are contributing to their respiratory failure. They are also at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulceration.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if their oxygenation and ventilation requirements are not met.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
4. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to their prolonged immobility and the presence of central lines and arterial lines.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to their immobility and the presence of central lines and arterial lines.
6. Stress ulceration: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulceration due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias due to their congestive heart failure and the presence of central lines and arterial lines.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection due to their prolonged immobility and the presence of central lines and arterial lines.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing various medical complications due to their underlying medical conditions and the presence of invasive devices. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to minimize the risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent an open cholecystectomy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He has a respiratory system resistance of 64 and a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 77 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 112/50 mmHg. He has a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, and is currently receiving aspirin and clopidogrel.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count is 6.6 K/uL, and his platelet count is 257 K/uL.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) 1 mg/hour
* Fentanyl (Concentrate) 75 mcg/hour
* Heparin sodium (Prophylaxis)
* Aspirin 81 mg
* Clopidogrel (held)
* Plavix (held)
* Simvastatin
* Ezetimibe
* Carvedilol (held)
* Captopril 6.25mg daily
* Glargine 19 units

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system resistance is high, and his plateau pressure is elevated, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, and his blood pressure is low, which may indicate cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of sepsis.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.
* Reduce sedation with propofol and repeat respiratory system resistance.
* Extubate the patient if tolerated.
* Continue diuresis if blood pressure permits.
* Restart tiotropium, xopenex, and pulmicort once extubated.
* Continue to hold Carvedilol for now.
* Restart simvastatin, ezetimibe, and carvedilol today if PO tolerated.
* Obtain EKG and restart Plavix if PO tolerated.
* Follow up with OSH oncologist.
* Continue prophylaxis with PPI, sc heparin, and SQ UF Heparin.
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac failure, renal failure, sepsis, and pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, COPD, DM2, and non-small cell lung cancer, who presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent open cholecystectomy. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/50 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 94% on 50% FiO2.

The patient had a failed spontaneous breathing trial and developed hypotension to SBP 80s-90s, which was thought to be related to autopeep. He was changed to AC ventilation, and his condition has improved, with increased alertness and responsiveness.

The patient has several medical conditions, including CHF with an EF of 35%, which is being managed with diuretics and vasodilators. He also has COPD, which is being treated with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. His DM2 is being managed with insulin, and his CAD is being treated with antiplatelet agents and beta-blockers.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilation is not optimized or if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, and there is a risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or surgical site infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of indwelling catheters.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a recent cholecystectomy, and there is a risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient develops coagulopathy or if the surgical site is not properly managed.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, and there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition or if the patient has a malabsorption syndrome.
6. Medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of medication-related complications, such as adverse drug reactions, interactions, or overdoses.
7. Cognitive decline: The patient is at risk of cognitive decline due to his age, medical conditions, and the use of sedatives and other medications.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of indwelling catheters.
9. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism, particularly given his immobility and the presence of indwelling catheters.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given his history of cholecystitis and the use of medications that can cause gastrointestinal side effects."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 66-year-old male with a history of CAD, COPD, DM2, and non-small cell lung cancer, was successfully extubated. He is currently receiving oxygen therapy at 2L via nasal cannula at home and is being managed for chronic cholecystitis, which was treated with open cholecystectomy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%.

The patient is receiving various medications, including furosemide, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium, as well as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. He is also receiving insulin therapy for his DM2.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 257 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L.

The patient's chest X-ray shows new volume overload, and he is being managed for this condition with diuretic therapy. His other medical conditions, including COPD and CHF, are being managed with various medications and therapies.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's new volume overload on chest X-ray may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF puts him at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to his lung cancer and recent surgery may increase his risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding complications during surgery and his use of anticoagulant medications may increase his risk of bleeding.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for malnutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's use of diuretic therapy and insulin therapy may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.
7. Medication interactions: The patient's use of multiple medications may increase his risk of medication interactions and adverse effects.

Overall, the patient's health progress in the ICU is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent an open cholecystectomy.

The patient has made significant progress, with successful extubation and improvement in his vital signs. He is currently receiving oxygen therapy and has a stable oxygen saturation level of 95%. His blood pressure is controlled, and he is diuresing as tolerated.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count
* Decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)

The patient's medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis
* Morphine sulfate for pain management
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis
* Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for surgical prophylaxis
* Tiotropium, xopenex, and pulmicort for COPD management
* Captopril for heart failure management
* Glargine for diabetes management
* Plavix for antiplatelet therapy (held due to CAD)

The patient's medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Liver dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypotension

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: pneumonia, respiratory acidosis
* AKI: acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalance
* Liver dysfunction: jaundice, coagulopathy
* Electrolyte imbalance: muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias
* Hyperglycemia: diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome
* Hypotension: shock, cardiac arrest

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue BiPAP as needed
* Maintain oxygen saturation level of 91-93%
* Diurese as blood pressure tolerates
* Restart tiotropium, xopenex, and pulmicort
* Continue gentle diuresis for heart failure management

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Adequately controlled,
   balancing pain control with respiratory status given hypersomnolence
   and hypercapnia yesterday.
 Open CCY:  Balancing pain meds as above.  Do need to try to mobilize
   him to the cardiac chair today given he is at higher risk for
   postoperative pneumonia given underlying COPD, splinting secondary to
   pain, atelectasis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  COPD with exacerbation in
   setting of volume overload postoperatively.  Gentle diuresis today with
   goal of 500 cc negative.  Given tenuous respiraotry status, continue to
   monitor in ICU.
 CHF,  LVEF~30%:  On captoril, lasix 20 mg IV x 1 this morning.
   Follow I/0s and electrolytes.  Replete K and Mg as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Adequately controlled,
   balancing pain control with respiratory status given hypersomnolence
   and hypercapnia yesterday.
 Open CCY:  Balancing pain meds as above.  Do need to try to mobilize
   him to the cardiac chair today given he is at higher risk for
   postoperative pneumonia given underlying COPD, splinting secondary to
   pain, atelectasis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:  COPD with exacerbation in
   setting of volume overload postoperatively.  Gentle diuresis today with
   goal of 500 cc negative.  Given tenuous respiraotry status, continue to
   monitor in ICU.
 CHF,  LVEF~30%:  On captoril, lasix 20 mg IV x 1 this morning.
   Follow I/0s and electrolytes.  Replete K and Mg as needed.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male who underwent an unspecified surgical procedure and developed postoperative respiratory failure. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) and nasal cannula oxygen therapy. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 132/51 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrioventricular paced, and his weight is 146.5 kg.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese male with crackles in the bases of his lungs, diminished breath sounds, and a prolonged expiratory phase. He also has soft, distended abdomen and trace edema in his lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL. His white blood cell count is 6.4 K/uL, and his platelet count is 257 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, respiratory failure, acute on chronic, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with exacerbation, and heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 30%. The patient is currently receiving captoril and lasix 20 mg IV, and his I/Os and electrolytes will be followed. The patient will also receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's underlying COPD and splinting due to pain increase his risk for postoperative pneumonia.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen if his volume overload is not managed.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent bleeding.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases his risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient requires close monitoring in the ICU to manage his respiratory failure, heart failure, and other underlying medical conditions. His pain control, electrolyte management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia should also be closely monitored."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Restart outpt. Glargine dose once taking POs
* Continue ASA 81 mg
* Restart simvastatin, ezetimibe, and carvedilol
* Follow up with OSH oncologist
* Continue prophylactic heparin
* Advance diet per surgery and replete lytes PRN
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and sepsis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to CAD or CHF
* Infection due to open cholecystectomy or other comorbidities
* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacteremia or organ failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of CAD, COPD, DM2, and non-small cell lung cancer, who presented with acute on chronic cholecystitis and underwent open cholecystectomy. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and is currently intubated and sedated. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/46 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a SpO2 of 92%. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 257 K/μL. He has a history of MI and is on medications such as Plavix, ASA, and simvastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying COPD and lung cancer.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and is at risk of developing sepsis, particularly with his current antibiotic regimen.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and is at risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, particularly with his recent surgery, and is at risk of developing bleeding complications due to his anticoagulant therapy.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly with his current antibiotic regimen and his underlying medical conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies due to his current diet and his underlying medical conditions.
8. Medication side effects: The patient is taking a number of medications, and is at risk of developing side effects from these medications, particularly with his anticoagulant therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Changes to oxycodone.
 OPEN CCY:  Pain adequately controlled. Normal bowel sounds on exam.
   Tolerating clears.  Poor appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: Secondary to volume overlaod
   and underlying COPD.  Improved with diuresis.  Likely some component of
   atelectasis.  Incentive spirometry, out of bed to chair as tolerated.
   Continue bronchodilators.  Lasix this morning.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been started on clears per surgery and has achieved a negative fluid balance at midnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.7°F, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 106/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, including crackles in the bases of the lungs and diminished breath sounds. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is obese. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with the patient being attentive and following simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 257 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's pain is controlled with oxycodone, and they are tolerating clears. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to volume overload and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is being treated with bronchodilators and diuresis, and is being encouraged to practice incentive spirometry and get out of bed to a chair as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Development of pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances or acidosis due to the patient's underlying COPD and respiratory failure
* Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and respiratory failure
* Poor wound healing or infection due to the patient's underlying COPD and respiratory failure."
