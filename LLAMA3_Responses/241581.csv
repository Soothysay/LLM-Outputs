   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - A line placed, measuring BP higher than cuff
   - lisinopril restarted, but pt not given b/c of high likelihood of
   intubation
   - TTE Monday
   - conversation w daughter prior to intubation
   - ESR, thyroid function tests; ddx includes papillary thyroid
   carcinoma, viral pneumonias, vasculitides
   - Pm lytes showed persistent hypernatremia, mildly improved
   (148-->147)-- didnt get free water in setting of tenuous respiratory
   status on bipap
   - DNR but OK to intubate if thought to be temporary
   - OSH cultures NGTD ; need to redo sputum cultures here - induced
   - ESR 93 ; PM Creat bumped from 1.8 --> 2.3
   - intubated 20:30 for worsening hypoxia and confusion on Bipap -- right
   mainstem intubation, was desatting, and ETT pulled back slightly by RT
   before first CXR ; First CXR confirmed ETT was just past carina on R--
   changes seen in R lung b/c hypoventilated; ETT pulled back to 20cm (was
   originally at 25cm), and CXR re-taken w ETT ~3cm from carina
   - at time of intubation, pt given 1.3L NS for hypotension from
   sedation; hypotension resolved quickly
   - NG tube placed
   - ventilate at 6cc/kg ; on 100% fiO2
   - after ETT pulled back second time (to 20cm), pt was given extra
   sedation, and BPs dropped to 80s (MAP 50), so sedation decreased, and
   he was bolused 500cc NS, responded well
   - ESR 93 ; Anti-GBM and ANCA pending
   - 5:20am BPs dropping again to 80s systolic (mid 50s MAP)--> 200cc NS
   bolus and dropped sedation further

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   .
   # Hypotension
   - Volume expansion with 1/2NS to avoid worsening hypernatremia
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/ced steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   .
   # Access: PICC to be placed today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement

   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 85-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration. He has a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 94% on 70% FiO2.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 92/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 22.7 cells/μL
* Hematocrit: 32.8%
* Platelet count: 228 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mmol/L
* Electrolytes: sodium 147 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 29.6 mmol/L
* Glucose: 107 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated, minimally responsive
* Diffuse rhonchi heard bilaterally, right greater than left
* Slightly tender abdomen with no guarding or rebound tenderness
* Worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure with refractory hypoxia
* Possible shunt or airspace disease preventing sufficient recruitment

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure
* Pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Hypernatremia
* Leukocytosis
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Hyperlipidemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* TTE with bubble study in the morning
* Manipulation of ventilator settings to make the patient more passive
* Increase PEEP to 10 cmH2O and consider restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg
* Consider chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin
* Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures
* Follow-up cultures from OSH for legionella and mycoplasma
* Consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Keep net even for now given history of chronic renal insufficiency

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration
* Hypoxic respiratory failure
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Hypernatremia
* Leukocytosis
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Aspiration

The patient's code status is DNR, but okay for intubation for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   - Check BNP, was 228 at OSH on [**3-5**].
   .
   # Hypotension
   - Volume expansion with 1/2NS to avoid worsening hypernatremia
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/c steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   .
   # HTN: Currently patient's BP is 148/74.  At home patient is on
   lisinopril. Repeat creatinine here 1.8. Since he is at his baseline
   creatinine, will continue his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily
   starting in AM.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from an outside hospital with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's current condition is critical, with refractory hypoxia despite 70% FiO2, and concern for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His blood pressure is labile, and he has required fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for:

* Leukocytosis (27.9) with a possible progression of infection or PNA
* Hypernatremia (147 mmol/L) with hyperchloremia, requiring careful fluid management
* Chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 and currently 2.3
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT 39, AST 28)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
* Elevated lactate level (1.5 mmol/L)

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a need for further workup to determine the cause of his hypoxia. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan is being considered if the patient stabilizes and no other diagnostic clues are obtained.

The patient's medications include:

* Lisinopril 10 mg daily (to be restarted)
* Pravastatin 10 mg QHS
* Midazolam 0.5 mg/hour
* Fentanyl 50 mcg/hour
* Famotidine 20 mg IV Q8h
* Heparin sodium 5000 units SQ Q12h

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Manipulating ventilation settings to make the patient more passive
* Increasing PEEP to 10 cmH2O and considering ARDS management
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/cipro)
* Obtaining endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures, and follow-up cultures from the outside hospital
* Considering a V/Q scan if high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Monitoring for hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalances
* Trending WBC and BUN/Cr levels
* Renally dosing medications
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and monitoring UOP

The patient's code status is DNR, with permission to intubate for temporary management of his respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE) limited
   given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement with
   diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to desat on
   exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up, concerning for
   CHF exacerbation. Patient had received steroids at OSH. Given that
   unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior history of COPD and lack of
   wheezing on exam, will not continue steroids.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Diurese with IV lasix prn, given 20 mg IV x 1 on admission.
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - Wean PEEP/FIO2 as able.
   - EKG.
   - Place A-line.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - TTE in am.
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   - Check BNP, was 228 at OSH on [**3-5**].
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/c steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Currently NPO given possibility of intubation.
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions..
   .
   # HTN: Currently patient's BP is 148/74.  At home patient is on
   lisinopril. Repeat creatinine here 1.8. Since he is at his baseline
   creatinine, will continue his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily
   starting in AM.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and he was intubated for worsening hypoxia and confusion on bipap. The patient has a high likelihood of aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has leukocytosis, which may be related to IV steroids given at the operating room or progression of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, and further workup for causes of hypoxia, such as pulmonary embolism, is limited due to chronic renal insufficiency.
2. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is 2, and he is currently at 1.9. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be renally dosed.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to IV steroids or progression of infection. WBC trends should be closely monitored.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for further aspiration due to his condition and should be closely monitored for signs of aspiration.
5. Hypertension: The patient's BP is currently 148/74, and he is on lisinopril. His creatinine is at baseline, so his current regimen of lisinopril 10 mg daily will be continued.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS will be continued.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his condition and should be closely monitored for signs of fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Diurese with IV lasix prn to manage fluid overload.
3. Monitor WBC trends and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue lisinopril 10 mg daily for hypertension.
5. Continue pravastatin 10 mg QHS for hyperlipidemia.
6. Monitor creatinine and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Monitor for signs of fluid overload and aspiration."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.
   - TTE with bubble study in am
   - manipulate vent settings
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently with PNA
   this is less likely so will hold for now).
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   - Check BNP, was 228 at OSH on [**3-5**].

   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   - Trend WBC.
   - D/c steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.

   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.

   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions..

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   status on bipap
   - DNR but OK to intubate if thought to be temporary
   - OSH cultures NGTD ; need to redo sputum cultures here - induced
   - ESR 93 ; PM Creat bumped from 1.8 --> 2.3
   - intubated 20:30 for worsening hypoxia and confusion on Bipap -- right
   mainstem intubation, was desatting, and ETT pulled back slightly by RT
   before first CXR ; First CXR confirmed ETT was just past carina on R--
   changes seen in R lung b/c hypoventilated; ETT pulled back to 20cm (was
   originally at 25cm), and CXR re-taken w ETT ~3cm from carina
   - at time of intubation, pt given 1.3L NS for hypotension from
   sedation; hypotension resolved quickly

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with 70% FiO2, but remains hypoxic. The patient's hypoxia is likely related to a shunt, possibly intracardiac or airspace disease, and further workup is limited due to chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2 and is likely related to a shunt.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a diagnosis of PNA, which is likely aspiration-related based on OSH records.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI): The patient has a baseline creatinine of 2.0 and is currently at 2.3.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 147 mmol/L, which is above the normal range.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 27.9, which is elevated.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/42 mmHg, which is low.
7. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration, which is likely the source of his PNA.
8. HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on lisinopril.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and is currently on pravastatin.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's PNA could worsen, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's CRI could worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Hypernatremia complications: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to dehydration, seizures, or other complications.
5. Leukocytosis complications: The patient's leukocytosis could lead to infection, sepsis, or other complications.
6. Hypotension complications: The patient's hypotension could lead to shock, organ failure, or other complications.
7. Aspiration complications: The patient's aspiration could lead to further respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
8. HTN complications: The patient's hypertension could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
9. Hyperlipidemia complications: The patient's hyperlipidemia could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. TTE with bubble study in the morning to assess for cardiac shunt.
2. Manipulation of ventilator settings to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues.
4. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
5. Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
6. Follow-up cultures from OSH for legionella and mycoplasma.
7. Consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE (currently holding due to PNA).
8. Keep net even for now given history of CRI.
9. Check BNP, which was 228 at OSH.
10. Trend WBC, BUN/Cr, and UOP.
11. Continue lisinopril and pravastatin as currently prescribed.
12. Monitor UOP and electrolytes.
13. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis.
14. Provide nutrition support with tube feeds and consider glycemic control measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis, who was transferred to the ICU due to worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's condition is complex and multi-faceted, with several potential medical complications.

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely hypoxic secondary to PNA from aspiration, with a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2, and further workup for causes of hypoxia is limited due to chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).
2. Hypotension: The patient became acutely hypotensive overnight, requiring three pressors (levo, neo, and vasopressin). The likely cause is sepsis, and treatment of the underlying infection is expected to improve this.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but the underlying cause is unclear.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to IV steroids given at the original hospital, and the dose of steroids has been discontinued.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine has increased from 1.9 to 2.6, likely due to poor forward flow caused by hypotension.
6. Aspiration: Aspiration is likely the source of the patient's PNA, and the patient will require tube feeds with nutrition recommendations and aspiration precautions.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
8. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely related to sepsis.
9. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, which is likely caused by PNA and aspiration.
10. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, which is worsening due to poor forward flow caused by hypotension.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for PNA and aspiration
* Respiratory isolation for r/o TB
* Empiric treatment for TB, if indicated
* ID consult for consideration of fungal infection
* Follow-up cultures from the original hospital for legionella and mycoplasma
* Chest CT, if stable and no other diagnostic clues
* Volume expansion with normal saline
* Weaning of sedation as tolerated
* Holding lisinopril and doxazosin
* Renally dosed medications
* Avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Monitoring of urine output

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is unclear at this time."

   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS. His hypoxia is presently refractory to 70% FiO2,
   likely related to a shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing
   sufficient recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE)
   limited given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement
   with diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to
   desat on exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up,
   concerning for CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after
   diuresis, without any improvement in saturation. Patient had received
   steroids at OSH. Given that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior
   history of COPD and lack of wheezing on exam, will not continue
   steroids.  TEE was performed and no intracardiac shunt was identified.
   Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie.
   Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though he was somewhat responsive to O2.  may
   have a component of ARDS in this picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - manipulate vent settings to maintain sat,
     - want to make patient more passive .
     - increase PEEP, aware that it can drop preload and possibly
   necessitate pressor initiation.
     - consider ARDS and restricting tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Could consider V/Q scan if high suspicion for PE
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - continue pressure support, wean as possible.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as not indicated since presentation not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.3, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Upward
   trending today to 2.6, continue to follow, this is likely due to poor
   forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC to be placed today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis, who was transferred to the ICU with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia refractory to 70% FiO2, likely due to a shunt or airspace disease. The CXR suggests possible miliary TB. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been treated with diuresis, steroids, and pressors. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypernatremia, leukocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and CXR findings suggest the possibility of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Tuberculosis (TB): The CXR findings suggest possible miliary TB, which can lead to respiratory failure, disseminated disease, and death.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen due to hypotension, sepsis, and other complications, leading to end-stage renal disease.
5. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration of gastric contents may lead to further respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen due to malnutrition, steroids, and other medications, leading to cardiovascular complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to seizures, brain damage, and death if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the underlying infection.
2. Manipulate ventilator settings to maintain oxygen saturation.
3. Consider ARDS and restrict tidal volume to 4-6 cc/kg.
4. Monitor for signs of sepsis and treat promptly.
5. Continue to manage chronic renal insufficiency with diuretics, fluid restriction, and electrolyte monitoring.
6. Consider empiric treatment for TB.
7. Monitor for signs of aspiration pneumonia and treat promptly.
8. Consider V/Q scan or chest CT if high suspicion for PE.
9. Continue to monitor and manage hyperlipidemia.
10. Monitor for signs of hypernatremia and treat promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following.
   - consider again wean down sedation and PEEP today
   - consider possible pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent
   matching.
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL, need to sent out hanta
   virus need to call [**Numeric Identifier 14291**] for the form.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high PEEP,
   treating the underlying infection will improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy - discussed with chest radiology
   recommended for repeat imagining with CT.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Fungal Markers Pending: pnd
   - Checking Random Cortisol: 19.5, not likely AI
   - testing for flu, virus: pnd
   - ? Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: holding steroids but if radiologist
   thinks it's compatabile - rec: CT scan for better characterization,
   given time course likely edema vs. infection.
   - decreasing PEEP from 15 to 10, and reducing sedation, as increased
   PEEP did not allow decreased FiO2 and oversedation may contribute to
   hypotension
   - OSH LDH, culture data - suppose to fax to us, but did not get it.
   - ID rec: MiniBAL - GS, CX, KOH stain, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].  Urine
   legionella/histo, Hanta virus sent out, try 1 dose of gentamycin
   (2mg/kg of dry wt).
   - renally dosing meds, vanco lvl in am.
   - overbreathing/disynchronise with the vent, went up on sedation, then
   went up on vent settings.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoxic respiratory failure is refractory to 70% FiO2, and there is a concern for possible ARDS or [**Doctor Last Name 11**] syndrome. The patient's hypercapnia may be due to poor perfusion of the lung, increased CO2 production in peripheral tissues, and dysynchrony with the vent.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, sedation, and possible high PEEP. Treating the underlying infection will improve this.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a result of IV steroids given at OSH or progression of infection/PNA. The patient's WBC is trending down, and steroids have been discontinued.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is 2, and currently, it is 2.6. This is likely due to poor forward flow due to hypotension (severe sepsis).
5. Aspiration: Aspiration is likely the source of the patient's PNA, and the patient will need tube feeds, nutrition recommendations, and aspiration precautions when extubated.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is managed with pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
7. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may be related to an underlying infection.
8. ARDS: The patient's CXR is questionable for infection, edema, or granulomatous disease, and ID is following up with markers and mini-BAL.
9. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: The patient's symptoms are compatible with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and the radiologist recommends a CT scan for better characterization.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning down sedation and PEEP today.
2. Considering pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent matching.
3. Restricting tidal volume as per ARDS protocol.
4. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro.
5. Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures, and follow-up with ID recs.
6. Treating aspiration PNA with antibiotics.
7. When extubated, the patient will need S+S eval prior to eating.
8. HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
9. Renally dosing meds.
10. Monitoring UOP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and suspected fungal infection. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a decreased FiO2 and PEEP.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating possible sepsis and renal failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Darvon, tramadol, and non-salicylate combination medication. The patient's current medications include vasopressin, midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure and elevated creatinine levels may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and mechanical ventilation may lead to further respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilator support.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor support may lead to cardiovascular instability, requiring increased monitoring and intervention.
5. Infection: The patient's suspected fungal infection may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality risk.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely, with a focus on early detection of sepsis, renal failure, and respiratory failure.
2. Adjust the patient's medications and dosing as needed to optimize respiratory and cardiovascular support.
3. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a MiniBAL, to determine the etiology of the patient's suspected fungal infection.
4. Continue to provide prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal therapy to prevent secondary infections.
5. Consider consultation with infectious disease and nephrology specialists to optimize the patient's care and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70% FiO2, question if
   shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing sufficient
   recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE) limited
   given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement with
   diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to desat on
   exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up, concerning for
   CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after diuresis, without any
   improvement in saturation. Patient had received steroids at OSH. Given
   that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior history of COPD and lack
   of wheezing on exam, will not continue steroids.  TEE was performed and
   no intracardiac shunt was identified.  Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe
   V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie. Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though
   he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of ARDS in this
   picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records. Given progression, concern exists for
   possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70% FiO2, question if
   shunt (?intracardiac vs airspace disease preventing sufficient
   recruitment). Further workup for causes of hypoxia (eg PE) limited
   given CRI so unable to obtain CTA. Some mention of improvement with
   diuresis today but no record re: LV function. Patient noted to desat on
   exam when laying flat with resolution when sitting up, concerning for
   CHF exacerbation. However was hypotensive after diuresis, without any
   improvement in saturation. Patient had received steroids at OSH. Given
   that unlikely COPD exacerbation given no prior history of COPD and lack
   of wheezing on exam, will not continue steroids.  TEE was performed and
   no intracardiac shunt was identified.  Hypoxemia is likely [**1-12**] severe
   V/Q mismatch (with V/Q close to 0
 ie. Intrapulmonary shunt)
 though
   he was somewhat responsive to O2.  [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of ARDS in this
   picture.   CXR suggested TB.
   - as patient
s pressures worsened yesterday and oxygenation remained
   constant, decrease PEEP to improve preload
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - respiratory isolation for r/o TB
 get 3x induced sputum or get BAL
   sample, consider empiric treatment.
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - ID consult
 is empiric treatment for TB indicated?  Anti-fungal
   coverage?  Any other workup indicated?
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   - Considering Chest CT if stable and no other diagnostic clues
   - Keep net even for now given h/o CRI.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis, treating the underlying infection will
   improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy.  Will discuss with chest radiology if
   appearance on CXR could be consistent.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and anxiety, who was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with refractory hypoxia despite 70% FiO2, and is likely due to a severe V/Q mismatch. The CXR suggests TB, but the patient has not been treated for TB yet. The patient's lung function is further compromised by ARDS, which is likely to be severe.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also critical, with hypotension requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's cardiac function is likely to be impaired due to sepsis and hypotension.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a baseline creatinine of 2 and currently 2.6. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hyperchloremia.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, with a recent history of gastroenteritis and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's aspiration risk is high, and the patient requires tube feeds with nutrition recommendations.

The patient's medication regimen is complex, with multiple antibiotics, steroids, and pressors. The patient's medication dosing is adjusted based on their renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia is severe and may continue to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. ARDS progression: The patient's ARDS is likely to be severe and may continue to worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency exacerbation: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is likely to be exacerbated by their sepsis and hypotension, which can lead to further compromise of their renal function.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to continue if not treated promptly and effectively, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance is likely to continue if not treated promptly and effectively, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration risk is high, and the patient may require further interventions to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
8. TB progression: The patient's CXR suggests TB, and the patient may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent TB progression.

In summary, the patient's condition is critical, and prompt and effective treatment is necessary to prevent further complications and improve their outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - consider again wean down sedation and FiO2 today
   - consider possible pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - consider again wean down sedation and FiO2 today
   - consider possible pressure support vs. paralysis for better vent
   matching.
   - restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and anxiety, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). He was transferred from another hospital with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis, but his condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to the current ICU admission.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with refractory hypoxia, hypercapnia, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He requires mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). His chest radiograph is suspicious for infection, edema, or granulomatous disease.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with hypotension that has been refractory to treatment with three pressors. He has been weaned down to two pressors, and his blood pressure is currently being managed with volume expansion and vasopressin.

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL and currently 2.6 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 27.9 K/uL, which may represent progression of infection or a side effect of IV steroids. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Progressive ARDS or acute lung injury, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis or septic shock, which may worsen his hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure, which may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Hyperlipidemia, which may increase his risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Aspiration pneumonia, which may recur if proper precautions are not taken during enteral feeding.
6. Infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other gram-negative bacteria, given his broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.
7. Fungal infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which may be suspected based on his CT scan findings.
8. Chronic kidney disease, which may progress if not managed properly.

In terms of potential medical interventions, the patient may require:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation with adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP.
2. Antibiotic therapy, including coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.
3. Vasopressor therapy to manage his hypotension.
4. Fluid management, including volume expansion and diuretic therapy, to manage his hypotension and edema.
5. Nutritional support, including enteral feeding with a pulmonary formula.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker.
7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.
8. Monitoring for and management of hyperlipidemia.

Overall, this patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of survival."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   - Follow up cultures from OSH inc legionella, mycoplasma.
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   depended on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now weaned down to 2
   (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high PEEP,
   treating the underlying infection will improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, will hold doxazosin.
   # Hypernatremia
 persistent, with hyperchloremia, now resolved.
   - free water flushes, 150 cc q4
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Now down trending
   - Trend WBC
   - D/C
ed steroids as it was felt that his presentation was not c/w COPD
   exacerbation.
   - If hypersensitivity pneumonitis is thought to be a possible source,
   could reinitiate steroid therapy - discussed with chest radiology
   recommended for repeat imagining with CT.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.6, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Fungal Markers Pending: pnd
   - Checking Random Cortisol: 19.5, not likely AI
   - testing for flu, virus: pnd
   - ? Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: holding steroids but if radiologist
   thinks it's compatabile - rec: CT scan for better characterization,
   given time course likely edema vs. infection.
   - decreasing PEEP from 15 to 10, and reducing sedation, as increased
   PEEP did not allow decreased FiO2 and oversedation may contribute to
   hypotension
   - OSH LDH, culture data - suppose to fax to us, but did not get it.
   - ID rec: MiniBAL - GS, CX, KOH stain, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].  Urine
   legionella/histo, Hanta virus sent out, try 1 dose of gentamycin
   (2mg/kg of dry wt).
   - renally dosing meds, vanco lvl in am.
   - overbreathing/disynchronise with the vent, went up on sedation, then
   went up on vent settings.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA, combined with the possibility of shunt and hypercapnia, suggest a high risk of developing ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count are indicative of sepsis. The presence of multiple comorbidities, such as chronic renal insufficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), increases the risk of sepsis.
3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 2 and current creatinine level of 2.6 suggest chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's hypotension and sepsis may exacerbate this condition.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and failed limited swallowing evaluation at the original hospital suggest a high risk of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS may not be adequate to manage his hyperlipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Fungal Infection: The patient's exposure to antibiotics and steroids may increase the risk of fungal infection. The ID rec's recommendation to check for PJP and follow up fungal markers suggests a concern for fungal infection.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's persistent hypernatremia and hyperchloremia may indicate a underlying condition, such as diabetes insipidus or hypothyroidism.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a result of infection, sepsis, or IV steroids. The trend in WBC count suggests that it may be a response to infection or sepsis.
9. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: The patient's history of COPD and recent steroid use may increase the risk of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The ID rec's recommendation to check for PJP and follow up fungal markers suggests a concern for hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
10. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and recent steroid use may increase the risk of COPD exacerbation.

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Aggressive management of sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Optimization of respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Management of chronic renal insufficiency with renally dosed medications and close monitoring of kidney function.
4. Prevention of aspiration pneumonia with tube feeds and aspiration precautions.
5. Monitoring of hyperlipidemia with regular lipid profiles and adjustment of pravastatin therapy as needed.
6. Monitoring of fungal markers and follow up with ID rec's recommendations.
7. Close monitoring of hypernatremia and hyperchloremia with regular electrolyte profiles and adjustment of fluid management as needed.
8. Monitoring of leukocytosis with regular WBC counts and adjustment of antibiotic therapy as needed.
9. Monitoring of hypersensitivity pneumonitis with regular lung function tests and adjustment of steroid therapy as needed.
10. Close monitoring of COPD exacerbation with regular lung function tests and adjustment of bronchodilator therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and
   possible high PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection
   may improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend.
   - Trend WBC
   - Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could potentially
   represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As this could
   potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and because no
   infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted solumedrol
   yesterday 125 mg IV x 1.
   - continue solumedrol empirically
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - If extubated, would need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and
   possible high PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection
   may improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend.
   - Trend WBC
   - Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could potentially
   represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As this could
   potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and because no
   infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted solumedrol
   yesterday 125 mg IV x 1.
   - continue solumedrol empirically
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - If extubated, would need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission to the hospital for gastroenteritis. He was transferred to the ICU with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA) from aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70%. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and was given steroids at the outside hospital, but the etiology of his PNA is unclear. The patient has a leukocytosis of 27.9, which may be due to progression of infection or IV steroids given at the outside hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia is refractory to 70% FiO2 and may be related to shunt, TTE, or ARDS. The CXR is questionable for infection, edema, or granulomatous disease.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, sedation, and high PEEP. Treating the underlying infection may improve this.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to progression of infection or IV steroids given at the outside hospital.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine is 2.4, which may be due to poor forward flow due to hypotension.
5. Aspiration: The patient's PNA is likely due to aspiration, and he requires tube feeds with nutrition recommendations and aspiration precautions.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia requires continued treatment with pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
7. FEN: The patient requires IVF bolus PRN for low UOP and repletion of electrolytes PRN.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 45 mL/hour
* Glycemic Control: Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin as needed
* Lines: 20 Gauge, Arterial Line, and PICC Line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Comments: The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status and requires continued treatment for his underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease.  ID is following, recommending
   checking for PJP
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - Endotracheal sputum cultures, blood cultures.
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   - follow up fungal markers
 for consideration of  fungal infection
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and
   possible high PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection
   may improve this.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer.  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend.
   - Trend WBC
   - Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could potentially
   represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As this could
   potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and because no
   infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted solumedrol
   yesterday 125 mg IV x 1.
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - When extubated will need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.
   # Access: PICC

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis. He was transferred to the ICU with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely hypoxic secondary to pneumonia, and his respiratory failure is refractory to 70% FiO2. There is concern for possible ARDS or shunt.
2. Hypotension: The patient became acutely hypotensive overnight and was transiently dependent on three pressors. He is currently on two pressors (levo and vaso) and is expected to improve with treatment of the underlying infection.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 14 to 27.9, which could represent progression of infection or a response to IV steroids.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine has increased from 1.9 to 2.4, likely due to poor forward flow and hypotension.
5. Aspiration: The patient likely aspirated food or liquids, which is the source of his pneumonia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
2. Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
3. Endotracheal sputum cultures and blood cultures
4. Follow-up with ID for markers and mini-BAL
5. Weaning of sedation as tolerated
6. Volume expansion with NS as needed
7. Holding lisinopril and doxazosin
8. Restarting solumedrol for possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis
9. Renal dose medications
10. Avoiding nephrotoxins
11. Monitoring UOP
12. Tube feeds with nutrition recommendations
13. Treating aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics
14. Elevating head of bed and taking aspiration precautions

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening ARDS or shunt
2. Sepsis or septic shock
3. Chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury
4. Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia
5. Hypoxia or respiratory failure
6. Hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis
7. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
8. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
9. Infections, such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections
10. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke."

   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease. Review of [**Month (only) 2299**] Xrays reveals
   early stages of same process, prompting initation of steroids.
   Negative for PJP, fungal markers. ID is following.
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol

   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease. Review of [**Month (only) 2299**] Xrays reveals
   early stages of same process, prompting initation of steroids.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, and recent admission for gastroenteritis, who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to PNA, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and respiratory support. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, leukocytosis, chronic renal insufficiency, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause, PNA, is not adequately treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and hypotension may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and the need for dialysis.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and hypotension may lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's PNA and leukocytosis may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia and chronic renal insufficiency may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which can worsen the patient's condition.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastroenteritis and PNA may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen the patient's condition.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and chronic renal insufficiency may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which can worsen the patient's condition.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to PNA, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, and the patient is being treated with vasopressors. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency requires careful monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolytes. The patient's hyperlipidemia requires continued treatment with pravastatin. The patient's aspiration PNA requires continued treatment with antibiotics and tube feeds.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient's disposition is ICU care. The patient's family meeting is scheduled for today to discuss goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo M with h/o HTN, CRI, anxiety, and recent admission at OSH for
   gastroenteritis, who is transfered from an OSH with worsening acute
   hypoxic respiratory failure and PNA.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient likely hypoxic secondary to PNA
   from aspiration per OSH records, was given steroid at OSH for COPD
   exacerbation, but held as not likely the source. Given progression,
   concern exists for possible [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS.  Hypoxia was refractory to 70%
   FiO2, question if shunt, TTE r/o
d intracardiac shunt, responsive to
   80% and PEEP (usually relates to the level of sedation pt is getting)
   related to respiratory effort.  Hypercapnia is likely due to poor
   perfusion of the lung, with possible increased CO2 production in the
   peripheral tissues and dysynchrony with the vent.  Component of ARDS in
   this picture may also contribute to this.   CXR is questionable for
   infection/edema/granulomatous disease. Review of [**Month (only) 2299**] Xrays reveals
   early stages of same process, prompting initation of steroids.
   Negative for PJP, fungal markers. ID is following.
   - Family meeting today for goals of care
   - Restricted tidal volume as per ARDS protocol
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn/cipro for now.
   - f/u CXR for interval improvement on steroids
   -f/u cxs
   - f/u ID recs
 sent for markers and mini-BAL
   .
   # Hypotension: patient became acutely hypotensive o/n on [**3-7**], was
   transiently dependent on 3 pressors(levo/neo/vaso) initially, now
   weaned down to 2 (levo/vaso).  Blood pressure is downtrending as of [**3-10**]
   on this regimen. Likely [**1-12**] sepsis and sedation, and possible high
   PEEP.  We expect that treating the underlying infection may improve
   this. Old CXR reviewed; showed perihilar opacities that could
   potentially represent initial lesions that have now progressed.  As
   this could potentially represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and
   because no infectious source has been identified, empirically restarted
   solumedrol [**3-9**] 125 mg IV x 1.
   - volume expansion with NS as needed
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - Holding lisinopril, doxazosin.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pt had leukocytosis on admission to OSH of 14. This has
   bumped to 27.9 at time of transfer,  Could represent progression of
   infection/PNA, but more likely a result of IV steroids given at OSH.
   Continues to downtrend, is 11 today.
   - Trend WBC
   - continue solumedrol empirically?
   .
   # Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine of 2 per OSH records
   and currently 2.4, from 1.9 at OSH at time of transfer.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow due to hypotension (likely severe sepsis).
   - Trend BUN/Cr.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Aspiration: this is likely the source of his PNA based on OSH records
   and failed limited S+S eval at OSH when on bipap.
   - Tube feeds with nutrition recs
   - Treating aspiration PNA with abx as above.
   - If extubated, would need S+S eval prior to eating.
   - HOB elevation, aspiration precautions.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
   .
   #  FEN: IVF bolus PRN for low UOP, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure, along with the need for high FiO2 and PEEP, suggest a high risk of developing ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and worsening renal function suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be related to the aspiration pneumonia or another underlying infection.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event and failed limited swallow evaluation at OSH, along with the need for tube feeds and treatment with antibiotics, suggest a high risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine of 2 and current creatinine of 2.4, along with the need for renally dosed medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins, suggest a high risk of worsening renal function.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent administration of lisinopril and doxazosin suggest a high risk of developing hypertension, which could worsen the patient's condition.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS suggests a high risk of developing hyperlipidemia, which could worsen the patient's cardiovascular status.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's need for tube feeds and nutrition recommendations suggests a high risk of malnutrition, which could worsen the patient's overall condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider steroids for possible ARDS.
2. Hypotension: Wean sedation as tolerated and consider volume expansion with NS as needed.
3. Leukocytosis: Trend WBC and consider continuing solumedrol empirically.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Trend BUN/Cr, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, and monitor UOP.
5. Aspiration: Treat aspiration PNA with antibiotics and consider tube feeds with nutrition recommendations.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Continue current regimen of pravastatin 10 mg QHS.
7. ICU Care: Monitor glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and nutrition.

The patient's family meeting today will discuss goals of care, and the patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."
