   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Doctor First Name 9056**]
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active [**Month/Year (2) 9056**] or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS and basal glargine
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation and has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of pneumonia, sepsis, and acute renal failure, and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a duodenal ulcer with large clots and has undergone endoscopy with clipping. The patient has also developed atrial fibrillation and is being treated for possible fungal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer with large clots is a significant risk factor for further bleeding, and the patient may require continued pressor support and transfusions to maintain hemodynamic stability.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely secondary to volume depletion and hypotension, and may require continued monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism, and he may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent these complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent history of sepsis make him at high risk for further infection, and he may require continued antimicrobial therapy and close monitoring for signs of infection.
6. Worsening opacities on CT: The patient's worsening opacities on CT scan may indicate a worsening fungal infection, and he may require further antifungal therapy and monitoring.
7. Refractory multiple myeloma: The patient's refractory multiple myeloma is a significant risk factor for further complications, including bleeding, infection, and organ dysfunction, and he may require continued immunosuppressive therapy and close monitoring.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pressor support and transfusions to maintain hemodynamic stability.
2. Continue mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Monitor and manage the patient's acute kidney injury to prevent further deterioration.
4. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke and thromboembolism in the patient with atrial fibrillation.
5. Continue antimicrobial therapy and close monitoring for signs of infection.
6. Consider further antifungal therapy and monitoring for worsening opacities on CT scan.
7. Continue immunosuppressive therapy and close monitoring for the patient's refractory multiple myeloma."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs

   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.

   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and respiratory failure. He has a history of parainfluenza pneumonia, ARDS, and ESBL pneumonias, and has been treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. He has also had a duodenal ulcer with large clots and has undergone endoscopy and clipping of the ulcer.

The patient's current condition is critical, with hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He is intubated and sedated, and has been given aggressive resuscitation with crystalloid and colloid. He has required intermittent pressor support and has had a recent hypotensive episode. His hemodynamics have stabilized, but he remains off pressors.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a urine output of 470 mL over the past 24 hours. His blood glucose level is 103 mg/dL, and his lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's respiratory status is also critical, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 100 mmHg. He has been treated with meropenem and vancomycin, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, with a recent episode of hypotension and a melanotic stool. He has undergone endoscopy and clipping of the duodenal ulcer, and his bleeding has been controlled with intermittent pressor support.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and he has had a recent episode of hypotension and a melanotic stool. He may continue to bleed and require further interventions.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is ongoing, and he may require further pressor support to maintain his blood pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he may require further interventions to improve his oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's AKI is ongoing, and he may require further interventions to improve his kidney function.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, and he may be at risk for further infections.
6. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bleeding and hypotension may put him at risk for sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's ongoing hypotension and tachycardia may put him at risk for cardiovascular instability.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and hypotension, and provide further interventions as necessary.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and provide further interventions as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and provide further interventions as necessary.
5. Consider further interventions to improve the patient's cardiovascular stability, such as vasopressors or inotropes.
6. Consider further interventions to improve the patient's respiratory function, such as bronchoscopy or pulmonary rehabilitation."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions.  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to
   inject and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of
   the bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  He received a total of 5U pRBC, 2 plts, and 5L IVF.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Month/Year (2) 9056**]
   - Type and Cross 4U
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support
   - attempt IJ for CVP measurement (goal [**6-26**])
   - holding BP meds
   - place foley for UOP monitoring (>30cc/hr)
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has required intermittent pressor support with neo
   and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.
   - IVF prn
   - Maintain MAPS >65 with pressor support (wean as tolerated)
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive resucitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded. Current setting
   are Vt:55, RR:16 PEEP:5 FiO2 50%.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given hypotension
   and pressor requirement patient likely to develop ATN.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds

   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants (changed to IV)
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID, Etanercept.
   - will need to discuss with BMT regarding IV dosing for Tacrolimus
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted on [**2165-2-25**] and now undergoing mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The patient has a complex medical history, including parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and right basilic vein thrombus.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated emergently for airway protection and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic instability is likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI bleeding and sedation following intubation.

The patient's laboratory results show impaired kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and a hematocrit of 29.1%. The patient's platelet count is 94,000/μL, and the white blood cell count is 15.3 x 10^9/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and pressor requirement.
2. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheter placement.
4. Sacral decubitus ulcer due to prolonged immobility.
5. GI bleeding complications, including perforation or stricture formation.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
7. Infection, including sepsis, secondary to immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance.
9. Respiratory failure progression or worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
10. Neurological complications, including seizures or encephalopathy, due to hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
2. Maintenance of invasive ventilation and pressor support as needed.
3. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion to maintain hemodynamic stability.
4. Antibiotic therapy for ESBL E. coli bacteruria.
5. Immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
6. Pain management and sedation as needed.
7. Wound care and decubitus ulcer prevention.
8. Nutrition and glycemic control management.
9. Regular communication with the patient's family and healthcare team.

The patient's ICU stay is likely to be prolonged, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a complex medical history, including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate is 114 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a central venous catheter and an arterial line.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 11,117 mL of fluid, including 8,301 mL of intravenous fluids and 2,816 mL of blood products.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 94 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are elevated.

Potential medical complications that may arise in the patient's condition include:

* Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a high-risk condition that may lead to further bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent use of antibiotics make him susceptible to infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or other arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal perforation, which may require emergency surgery.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance closely.
* Adjust the patient's mechanical ventilation settings as needed to maintain optimal oxygenation and ventilation.
* Continue to provide aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support as needed to maintain the patient's blood pressure.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy or other diagnostic tests as needed to determine the cause of the bleeding.
* Consider antibiotic therapy for potential infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
* Consider dialysis for the patient's acute renal failure.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
* Consider surgical consultation for the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and potential gastrointestinal perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone mini-allogeneic SCT. He is currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. He has a history of complications including parainfluenza pneumonia, ARDS, and ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia. He is currently receiving treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteruria and has been prescribed immunosuppressants for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has a duodenal ulcer with large clots, which may lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure, which may indicate hypovolemia or sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of infections and is currently receiving treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which may lead to sepsis.
6. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient is at risk for GVHD due to his immunosuppressed state and may require further treatment.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, which may lead to complications such as arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
8. Wound complications: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which may become infected or develop further complications.
9. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a right basilic vein thrombus and may be at risk for further thrombotic events.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of infections and is at risk for further infections due to his immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding complications closely and consider further treatment for the duodenal ulcer.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with pressor support and fluids as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further treatment for acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and consider further treatment for VAP.
5. Monitor the patient's sepsis risk and consider further treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteruria.
6. Continue to manage the patient's GVHD with immunosuppressants and consider further treatment as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and consider further treatment as needed.
8. Continue to manage the patient's wound complications with wound care and consider further treatment as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and consider further treatment as needed.
10. Monitor the patient's infection risk and consider further treatment as needed."

   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.

   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions.  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to
   inject and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of
   the bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  He received a total of 5U pRBC, 2 plts, and 5L IVF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including multiple myeloma, mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and ongoing immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and they have required intermittent pressor support to maintain pressures.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a large duodenal ulcer with clots, which was treated with endoscopy and clipping.
* Renal function: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.
* Infectious diseases: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which is being treated with a 14-day course of meropenem.
* Immunosuppression: The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and cellcept.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to ongoing lung injury and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of bacteremia make them susceptible to sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of bacteremia make them susceptible to new infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of bacteremia may lead to neurological complications, including meningitis, encephalitis, or seizures.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, hemodynamic, and gastrointestinal status. They also require ongoing immunosuppressive therapy and treatment for their infectious diseases."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active bleeding
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS and basal glargine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] and has undergone mini-allogeneic SCT. The patient has a complex medical history, including Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias, bacteremia, and right basilic vein thrombus.

The patient is currently in the ICU for GI bleed, which was managed with emergent fluid resuscitation, PRBC transfusions, and endoscopic treatment. The patient has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure and has been treated with IV PPI and NPO.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hct: 32.9-33.7%
* WBC: 8.4-10.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 63-96 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4-1.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20-30 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103-190 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36-37°C
* Heart rate: 121-130 bpm
* Blood pressure: 139/83-148/106 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19-20 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's medical complications include:

* Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
* Hypotension
* Respiratory failure
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria
* Refractory multiple myeloma
* Gastrointestinal bleed
* Hypertension
* Diabetes mellitus type 2
* Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: AFib may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, and the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and respiratory arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent antibiotic use may increase the risk of infection, particularly with resistant organisms.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing GI bleed and recent transfusions may lead to bleeding complications, including hematemesis, melena, or hematuria.
* Wound complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to wound infection, osteomyelitis, or sepsis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Management of AFib with rate control medications
* Treatment of hypotension with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors
* Management of respiratory failure with ventilatory support
* Treatment of ARF with fluid management and avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Management of ESBL E. coli bacteruria with antibiotic therapy
* Treatment of refractory multiple myeloma with chemotherapy and immunotherapy
* Management of gastrointestinal bleed with endoscopic treatment and transfusions
* Treatment of hypertension with antihypertensive medications
* Management of diabetes mellitus type 2 with insulin and oral agents
* Treatment of sacral decubitus ulcer with wound care and debridement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active bleeding
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, admitted to the MICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute renal failure (ARF), and respiratory failure.
* The patient has a history of mini-allogeneic stem cell transplant, Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).
* The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to airway protection and respiratory failure.
* The patient has a GI bleed, which is ongoing, and has required multiple units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and platelets.
* The patient has ARF, likely due to volume depletion and hypotension, and is being treated with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
* The patient has a metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
* The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and has tachycardia, but is not receiving anticoagulation due to the ongoing GI bleed.
* The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which is being treated with meropenem, and is at risk for sepsis.
* The patient has worsening opacities on CT scan, which may indicate a fungal infection, and is being treated with voriconazole.
* The patient has a history of immunosuppression and is at risk for opportunistic infections.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to the ongoing GI bleed and ESBL E. coli bacteruria
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the ongoing respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the ongoing ARF
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the suspected PE and ongoing immobility
* Fungal infections due to the worsening opacities on CT scan and treatment with voriconazole
* Opportunistic infections due to the patient's immunosuppressed state
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the ongoing GI bleed and potential bleeding from the duodenal ulcer

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The patient should continue to receive aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure and perfusion. The patient should also receive anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient's immunosuppressive medications should be adjusted to minimize the risk of opportunistic infections. The patient should also receive wound care and pressure ulcer prevention measures to prevent further skin breakdown."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] who has undergone mini-allogeneic SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias, and bacteremia. The patient has been admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, pressure support of 10 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's SpO2 is 99% and ABG shows pH 7.41, PaO2 500, and PaCO2 30.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is receiving intermittent pressor support with neo and levo. The patient's blood pressure is 139/83 mmHg, and his heart rate is 121 bpm.
* Renal: The patient has oliguria with a urine output of 540 mL in the past 24 hours. His creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL, and his BUN is 146 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient has a platelet count of 96 K/uL and a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL.
* Infectious: The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteruria and is receiving a 14-day course of meropenem.

The patient's medical history includes:

* Refractory multiple myeloma
* Mini-allogeneic SCT
* Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS
* Multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia
* Right basilic vein thrombus and suspected PE
* AMS with negative LP
* GVHD and duodenal ulcer

The patient's current medications include:

* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 80 mg IV q12h
* Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
* Acyclovir 400 mg IV q8h
* Bactrim (SMX/TMP) 800 mg/160 mg PO q12h
* Meropenem 1 g IV q8h
* Voriconazole 200 mg IV q12h

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure can fluctuate, leading to hypotension or hypertension.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguria can worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's GI bleed can worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock or bleeding complications.
* Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy can increase his risk of infection and bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status closely and to adjust his medications and treatment plan as needed to prevent complications and promote recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU for multiple myeloma (cancer) with atrial fibrillation (AFib) and gastrointestinal bleeding (meena). He has been receiving invasive ventilation and has had multiple episodes of melena (bloody stools). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 131 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including voriconazole, metoprolol, and diltiazem, and has had multiple doses of antibiotics, including meropenem and acyclovir. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 78,000/μL.

The patient has also had multiple imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan, which have shown no evidence of pulmonary embolism or other complications.

The patient's condition has been stable, with no significant changes in his vital signs or laboratory results over the past 24 hours. However, he has had two episodes of melena, which may be related to his gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or other complications.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent antibiotics may increase his risk of infection, particularly with fungal or viral pathogens.
3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support and potential for aspiration may increase his risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and potential for cardiac arrhythmias may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent antibiotics may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as encephalopathy or seizures.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - Started Metoprolol 50 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID). Will hold dilt
   90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN.
   In addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6.
   - check urine lytes
   - check PM lytes to see if hyponatremia worsened
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc.
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID. Will not
   taper methyl pred levels until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO. Still holding home dilt.
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   # DM 2: Continue ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN.
   In addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6.
   - check urine lytes
   - check PM lytes to see if hyponatremia worsened
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc.
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID. Will not
   taper methyl pred levels until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO. Still holding home dilt.

   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or cardiac failure.
	* Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is currently in AFib, which increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and increased risk of bleeding.
	* Duodenal ulcer: The patient has a large duodenal ulcer that is actively bleeding, which can lead to further GI bleeding and complications.
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased, which can lead to further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
	* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which can lead to seizures, brain damage, and other complications.
4. Infection complications:
	* ESBL E. coli bacteruria: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and other complications.
	* Possible sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised, which increases the risk of sepsis and other infections.
5. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and other complications.
6. Immunosuppression complications:
	* Refractory multiple myeloma: The patient's cancer is refractory to treatment, which increases the risk of further complications and mortality.
	* GVHD: The patient is at risk for graft-versus-host disease, which can lead to severe complications and mortality.
7. Other complications:
	* Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can lead to organ damage, shock, and other complications.
	* Wound complications: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which can lead to further wound complications, infection, and mortality.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and developed various complications, including parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Current status:

* The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation with a respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 901 mL.
* His heart rate is 131 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 128/80 mmHg.
* He has a central venous catheter and a midline catheter in place.
* His creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 34.0 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
* He has a mild metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.35 and a bicarbonate level of 20 mEq/L.
* His platelet count is 78,000/mcL, and his white blood cell count is 10.3/mcL, indicating potential bone marrow suppression.
* He has a duodenal ulcer that was treated with endoscopy and clipping, but it is still actively bleeding.
* He has a right basilic vein thrombus and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney injury. He may require further management, including dialysis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer is still actively bleeding, and he may require further endoscopic or surgical management.
4. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central venous catheter.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a suspected PE, which may require further management, including anticoagulation therapy.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he may require further management to stabilize his cardiovascular status.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation level is not specified, but he may be at risk for neurological complications, including seizures or delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue invasive ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Manage the patient's kidney function closely, including monitoring creatinine and BUN levels, and considering further management, such as dialysis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding, including further endoscopic or surgical management.
4. Monitor the patient's infection risk closely, including monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting his antibiotic regimen as necessary.
5. Consider further management for the patient's suspected PE, including anticoagulation therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, including adjusting his blood pressure medication as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including adjusting his sedation level as necessary."

   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - cont metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg
   QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - decide when pt can ADAT per BMT recs, otherwise NPO except meds
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - H pylori negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially
   presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%),
   which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However,
   given prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic
   ATN. Now with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH.
   Initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear
   but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial
   process (unlikely)
   - free water restrict 1L
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # ID:
   --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   - ? new lingular infiltrate vs atalectasis on CXR, clinically stable
   for now, so will repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   -- ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS
   .
   # FEN:
   -f/u BMT above whether pt needs to be NPO or if we can ADAT
   -continue TPN
   - PICC line for TPN necessary, as currently getting through midline,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has a complex medical history, including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, ARF, right basilic vein thrombus, suspected PE, and duodenal ulcer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for GI bleed and has undergone emergency EGD with endoclip placement to control the bleeding. He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure and has been transfused with pRBCs and platelets.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, which is at risk for osteomyelitis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a new lingular infiltrate on CXR, which may be due to a pulmonary process or infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, and is currently colonized with ESBL E. coli bacteruria.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine of 1.6 and BUN of 81. He is at risk for further renal impairment due to ongoing nephrotoxicity and volume depletion.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to SIADH or other underlying conditions.
6. GI Bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of GI bleed, which may be due to duodenal ulcer or other underlying conditions.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has required mechanical ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and history of multiple infections.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical issues. The plan is to continue to manage his GI bleed with endoclip placement and pressor support, and to monitor his renal function and electrolyte levels. The patient will also require ongoing respiratory support and infection prevention measures."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - cont metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg
   QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - decide when pt can ADAT per BMT recs, otherwise NPO except meds
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - H pylori negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially
   presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%),
   which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However,
   given prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic
   ATN. Now with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH.
   Initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear
   but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial
   process (unlikely)
   - free water restrict 1L
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # ID:
   --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   - ? new lingular infiltrate vs atalectasis on CXR, clinically stable
   for now, so will repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   -- ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, and other complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.1°C, HR 113 bpm, BP 123/67 mmHg, RR 12 breaths/min, SpO2 98%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen therapy
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous catheter (CVC) and arterial catheter
* Fluid balance: 3,150 mL total input, 1,025 mL total output, with a positive balance of 2,125 mL
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 6.7 K/μL, Hct 31.3%, Plt 38 K/μL
	+ Renal function: Cr 1.6 mg/dL, BUN 80 mg/dL
	+ Liver function: LFTs stable
	+ Electrolytes: Na 131 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 103 mEq/L
* Medical history: Multiple myeloma, mini-allogeneic SCT, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and possible pulmonary embolism
* Current medications:
	+ Anticoagulants: Diltiazem 90 mg QID, Metoprolol 75 mg TID
	+ Antibiotics: None currently prescribed
	+ Anti-inflammatory agents: Methylprednisolone 30 mg IV Q12H
	+ Immunosuppressive agents: Tacrolimus, Cellcept
	+ Antifungal agents: Voriconazole

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is inadequate. He may require further management of his fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent worsening of his renal function.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and he may require further management of his bleeding risk factors, such as anticoagulation therapy and endoscopy.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may require further management with anticoagulation therapy and rate control medications.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and he may require further management with anticoagulation therapy and thrombolytic therapy if necessary.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, and he may require further management with antibiotics and antifungal agents if necessary.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to his mini-allogeneic SCT, and he may require further management with immunosuppressive agents and monitoring of his immune function.
7. Fluid overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, and he may require further management with diuretics and fluid restriction to prevent fluid overload.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications that require careful management to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - On metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO except meds
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic ATN. Now
   with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6. FeNa 1.9,
   Uosm>500. ? SIADH [**12-17**] ventilation.
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with necrotic tissue, and there is a low threshold to think about osteomyelitis. Regular monitoring and wound care are essential to prevent infection.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and the Cr level is increasing. Close monitoring of Cr levels and avoidance of nephrotoxins are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia, and it is essential to determine the underlying cause, whether it is SIADH or volume depletion. Regular monitoring of sodium levels and fluid balance is necessary.
4. GI bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of GI bleeding, and it is essential to maintain active bleeding control and monitor for signs of re-bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection, but the respiratory failure has resolved. However, it is essential to wean oxygen as tolerated and monitor for signs of respiratory compromise.
6. Hypotension: The patient has required intermittent pressor support due to hypovolemia, and it is essential to maintain MAPS >65 and UOP >30 to prevent hypotension.
7. Infections: The patient has had multiple infections, including ESBL E. coli bacteruria, and it is essential to monitor for signs of new infections and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
8. GVHD: The patient is at risk of developing GVHD due to immunosuppression, and it is essential to monitor for signs of GVHD and adjust therapy accordingly.
9. Wound infection: The patient has a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and there is a risk of wound infection. Regular monitoring and wound care are essential to prevent infection.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has had multiple episodes of tachycardia and hypotension, and it is essential to monitor for signs of cardiovascular instability and adjust therapy accordingly.

The patient's medical history includes refractory multiple myeloma, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of GI bleeding, which increases the risk of complications. The patient is also at risk of developing infections due to immunosuppression. Regular monitoring and close attention to the patient's vital signs and laboratory results are essential to prevent and manage potential complications."
