 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Daughter [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1936**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11582**])
   Disposition: To floor today early if cuff pressures correlate, later in
   day if pressures are stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Summary:**

The patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU with mental status changes, tremor, and renal failure. She has a history of CABG and was recently discharged from rehab. She developed pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. Her mental status has improved, but she still has a mild tremor.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has radiographic evidence of a right lower lobe pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level has improved, but she is still at risk for further kidney damage or failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
3. **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is still low, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion, shock, and death.
4. **Delirium and Tremor:** The patient's mental status changes and tremor could be due to neurontin toxicity or other causes. This can lead to further cognitive decline, falls, and increased risk of complications.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, but it can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, increased risk of infections, and cardiovascular complications.
6. **Post-CABG Complications:** The patient has a history of CABG and post-op atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
7. **Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances:** The patient's fluid and electrolyte status is critical, and imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.

**Plan of Care:**

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of worsening infection.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Consider further work-up for anemia, including iron studies and B12 and folate levels.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte status and adjust treatment as needed.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Consider consulting with a nephrologist for further guidance on managing the patient's acute renal failure.
3. Consider consulting with a cardiologist for further guidance on managing the patient's post-CABG complications.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte status and adjust treatment as needed."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Most likely source seems to
   be hypovolemia.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics
   Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO intake and
   hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a Pneumonia as
   supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.  Levaquin already
   administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at the time of this
   note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to obtain due to
   tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.  Other
   possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing renal
   stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO
   intake and hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a
   Pneumonia as supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.
   Levaquin already administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at
   the time of this note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to
   obtain due to tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.
   Other possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing
   renal stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia, which may lead to sepsis, particularly given her hypotension and elevated WBC count.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk of developing AKI due to her hypotension, poor PO intake, and potential nephrotoxic medications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia and is at risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly given her hypotension and potential sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CABG and is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation, given her hypotension and elevated troponin levels.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of bleeding and is at risk of developing bleeding complications, particularly given her thrombocytosis and potential nephrotoxic medications.
6. Delirium: The patient has developed altered mental status and tremulousness, which may be due to her underlying infection, medications, or worsening renal failure.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she is at risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly given her hypotension and potential AKI.
8. Infection: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia and is at risk of developing other infections, particularly given her hypotension and potential sepsis.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and treated with antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care measures. The patient's medications should be carefully managed to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity and bleeding complications. Regular lab tests should be performed to monitor the patient's renal and cardiac function, as well as her electrolyte levels."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Daughter [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1936**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11582**])
   Disposition: To floor today early if cuff pressures correlate, later in
   day if pressures are stable.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She has a history of CABG and was recently discharged from rehab. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 154/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL and a hematocrit of 26.7%. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 70 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic renal failure, anemia, and a history of CABG. She is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a confused mental status, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15. Her lungs are clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. She has a mild tremor in her hands, which is thought to be related to neurontin toxicity.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or death.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to shock, organ failure, or death.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
5. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, such as urinary tract infection or sepsis, which can lead to organ failure or death.
6. Bleeding: The patient may develop bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria, which can lead to anemia, hypotension, or death.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CABG and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and tremors may worsen, leading to neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, or death.

In summary, the patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time but is staying in the ICU as there are no hospital beds
   available.
   1. Health-care associated Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   right sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  She will
   require a seven-day course of antibiotics including vancomycin, so she
   will require IV access.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  We will increase dosing today
   based on improved renal function and check a vancomycin trough in the
   morning.
   - We will have her assessed for PICC placement so she can possibly go
   to rehab.
   2. Hypotension: Her blood pressures have improved, either because of
   treatment of her pneumonia, clearance of gabapentin or fluid
   resuscitation.  She appears to have difficulty drinking water because
   of her arthritis, but we will encourage PO intake as she has been
   negative for two days and was dehydrated on admission.  She is
   beginning to become hypertensive, but we will hold her home
   antihypertensives until we can be sure she is stable.
   - Continue to hold metoprolol and lisinopril.  Restart short-acting
   metoprolol if she is hypertensive.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: She continues to improve.  Her symptoms
   were presumably due to acute infection and gabapentin overload.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls and evaluate whether she should
   go home or to rehab.
   - Hold compazine and neurontin and talk to PCP about these medication
   changes.
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.1 from 2.8 on admission.  Appears to have been pre-renal.  No further
   work-up for now.
   - Encourage PO intake.
   - Take-out foley catheter.
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure.  Had been on amiodarone for peri-operative A-fib.  We will
   restart amiodarone and defer to her out-patient cardiologist to decide
   the course.
   - Restart amiodarone
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin now that IV heparin stopped.
   Access: PIVs.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She has undergone CABG surgery and has a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Pneumonia with radiographic evidence of right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, with associated right-sided pleuritic pain. She is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, and has a seven-day course planned.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, which has improved with treatment of pneumonia, clearance of gabapentin, and fluid resuscitation. She is beginning to become hypertensive, and her home antihypertensives are being held.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, which is improving, with a diagnosis of tremulousness possibly due to acute infection and gabapentin overload.
* Renal: Acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. No further work-up is planned at this time.
* Hematological: Anemia of chronic disease, with a stable hematocrit level. No further work-up is planned at this time.
* Gastrointestinal: Chronic pain and glaucoma, with ongoing treatment with Omeprazole and Latanoprost, respectively.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia progression and development of respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Hypertension and potential cardiac complications
* Delirium and cognitive decline
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to chronic pain and glaucoma
* Infection-related complications, such as sepsis or septic shock

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management
* Hold of home antihypertensives and close monitoring of blood pressure
* Restart of amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Ongoing treatment for chronic pain and glaucoma
* Regular diet and repletion of electrolytes as needed

The patient's disposition is currently ""called-out to floor,"" indicating that she is being transferred to a lower level of care. However, further evaluation and management are needed to address her complex medical condition and potential complications."
