You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU after undergoing jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.1°C (97°F), HR 97 bpm, BP 156/85 mmHg, RR 18 insp/min, SpO2 98% on 3L NC.
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
* Pain controlled with morphine PCA.
* UOP maintained at >30cc/hr.
* NG tube in place.
* JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
* Colostomy and abdominal binder in place.
* IV diltiazem drip for rate control.
* Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H for heart rate control.
* Telemetry monitoring.
* NPO including medications, except for PO diltiazem via NG tube.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's recent surgery and presence of JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total output of 655 mL and input of 2782 mL, which may lead to hypovolemic shock.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fasting blood sugar (FBS) is 150s, which may be a result of post-operative stress and pain. Tight glucose control is necessary to promote healing.
4. Infection: The presence of JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid increases the risk of infection.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may progress to more severe arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism due to her atrial fibrillation and recent surgery.
7. Wound complications: The patient's recent surgery and presence of JP drains may increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential inability to tolerate oral medications may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results. The patient's pain should be controlled, and her atrial fibrillation should be managed with rate control medication. Additionally, the patient's hyperglycemia should be closely monitored and managed with tight glucose control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She is currently in the ICU due to small bowel obstruction (SBO) and jejunal resection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.2°C, Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 97 bpm, BP 156/85 mmHg, RR 18 insp/min, SpO2 98% on 3L NC
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR)
* Fluid balance: Total in 2,782 mL, total out 655 mL, urine output 250 mL, NG output 190 mL
* Physical examination: obese female in pain, awake and oriented x3, with abdominal binder opened by surgery
* Labs: sodium 4.0 mEq/L, potassium 32.4%, magnesium 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 32.4%, and pending labs

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Diltiazem drip for rate control
* Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
* Morphine PCA for pain control
* Zofran 8mg IV q8h for nausea
* IV fluids (LR 20cc/hr) for maintenance
* TPN with lipids for nutrition

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Abdominal compartment syndrome due to SBO and jejunal resection
* Worsening of atrial fibrillation due to tachycardia and rapid ventricular response
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility
* Stress ulcer due to post-operative stress and pain
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Hyperglycemia due to post-operative stress and pain
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to SBO and jejunal resection

The patient's code status is full code, and she is being followed by surgery. The plan is to continue monitoring her condition, manage her pain and fluid balance, and address any potential complications that may arise."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who was recently admitted to the ICU following surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR) and is experiencing pain at the incision site.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
2. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient's blood sugars are in the 150s, which may indicate a risk for developing hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Crohn's disease: The patient's history of Crohn's disease may increase her risk for complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
4. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain at the incision site and is receiving morphine PCA and toradol to manage her symptoms.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 454 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* ECG: The patient's ECG is unchanged compared to previous studies.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Atrial fibrillation management: The patient will continue to receive IV diltiazem and metoprolol.
2. Pain management: The patient will receive morphine PCA and toradol to manage her pain.
3. Glucose management: The patient's blood sugars will be monitored closely, and adjustments will be made to her insulin regimen as needed.
4. Crohn's disease management: The patient's anti-inflammatory medications will be held, and she will be monitored for signs of Crohn's disease flares.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU following surgical revision of jejunal stricture. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF w/ RVR) and is complaining of pain at the incision site. She has been started on IV diltiazem and metoprolol, and is being transitioned to PO diltiazem via NGT. She is also receiving TPN with lipids and has impaired glucose tolerance, with blood sugars in the 150s.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, or cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which increases her risk of infection. The presence of a central line and NG tube also increases her risk of infection.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a SpO2 of 97% on nasal cannula oxygen. She may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygenation status deteriorates.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient's heart rhythm is irregular, and she may be at risk for cardiac failure if her heart function deteriorates.
6. Sepsis: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of sepsis.
7. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for thrombosis due to her central line and recent surgery.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, but may be at risk for malnutrition if her nutritional needs are not met.
9. Infection of the surgical site: The patient's incision site may be at risk for infection, which could lead to further complications.
10. Delayed recovery: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and ongoing medical complications may delay her recovery from surgery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO) and developed tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. She is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management medications. Her condition is being closely monitored for potential complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome, hyperglycemia, and Crohn's disease exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdominal surgery and SBO increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's pre-diabetic status, post-operative stress, and pain can contribute to hyperglycemia, which can worsen wound healing and increase the risk of infections.
3. Crohn's Disease Exacerbation: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery increase the risk of disease exacerbation, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications, malnutrition, and increased risk of infections.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's nasogastric tube and recent surgery increase the risk of pneumonia, which can be complicated by the patient's underlying conditions.
5. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and recent surgery increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and recent surgery increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's recent surgery and SBO increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's SBO and recent surgery increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and fistula formation."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
    She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple abdominal surgeries, including jejunal resection for small bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the ICU for rate control and management of post-operative pain. The patient is currently experiencing tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting, and is not tolerating oral medications. She has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving IV fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFIB w/ RVR) is a significant concern. The patient's tachycardia may be exacerbated by pain and stress, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries, which increases her risk of developing infections. The presence of JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid and the patient's recent surgery also increase the risk of infection.
3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdominal surgery and the presence of JP drains may increase the risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's nasogastric tube and the possibility of respiratory acidosis may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate oral medications and her nasogastric tube may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly if her IV fluids and TPN are not adequately meeting her nutritional needs.
6. Anemia: The patient's recent 5-point hematocrit drop may indicate a significant bleeding or hemolysis, which could be exacerbated by her Crohn's disease and abdominal surgery.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's pre-diabetic status and post-operative stress may increase her risk of developing hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early on and take prompt action to prevent or manage them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour follow-up after admission with atrial fibrillation (AF) and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV diltiazem for AF and IV metoprolol for rate control. The patient is also receiving TPN with lipids for nutrition and has a PICC line and 18-gauge line for IV access.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 454 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L.

The patient's pain is being managed with morphine PCA and toradol. The patient's glucose levels are being monitored and are within the normal range.

Potential medical complications:

1. SBO: The patient's SBO is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and distension may worsen if the obstruction is not managed effectively.
2. AF: The patient's AF is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's heart rate and rhythm should be closely monitored to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's glucose levels should be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycemia.
4. Infection: The patient's SBO and AF increase the risk of infection. The patient's temperature and white blood cell count should be closely monitored to detect any signs of infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's SBO and AF increase the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory rate should be closely monitored to detect any signs of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's AF increases the risk of cardiac failure. The patient's heart rate and rhythm should be closely monitored to detect any signs of cardiac failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's colitis, status post colonic resection, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to high residuals, which resulted in transition back to IV diltiazem due to NPO status.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 99 bpm (75-144 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/58 mmHg (68-154/89 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (13-24 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, and the current diagnosis is small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and is being monitored for glycemic control.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 454 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include:

* PT: 13.7 seconds
* PTT: 27.8 seconds
* INR: 1.2
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
* S1 and S2 heart sounds
* No murmurs or gallop
* Clear lungs
* Abdominal binder in place
* JP drains in place
* 1+ lower extremity edema
* No clubbing or cyanosis
* Alert and oriented x3

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO) with potential for intestinal perforation or necrosis
* Impaired glucose tolerance with potential for hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
* Crohn's disease flares with potential for bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage
* Nutritional deficiencies due to malabsorption or gastrointestinal tract obstruction
* Infections due to compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulability"

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, status post colonic resection, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was recently transitioned back to IV diltiazem due to high residuals and NPO status. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has been monitored for respiratory support, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF with RVR may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels is necessary.
2. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient's blood sugars have been in the 150s, which may indicate impaired glucose tolerance. Close monitoring of her blood sugars and adjusting her insulin sensitivity is necessary.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent jejunal resection may increase her risk of small bowel obstruction. Close monitoring of her abdominal pain and bowel movements is necessary.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and recent antibiotics may increase her risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adjusting her antibiotic regimen is necessary.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing VTE. Close monitoring of her deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and adjusting her anticoagulation regimen is necessary.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent jejunal resection may increase her risk of developing hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of her blood sugars and adjusting her insulin sensitivity is necessary.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring of her electrolyte levels and adjusting her medication regimen is necessary."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.
   -ISS
   .
   #. Crohn's Disease: Pt with multiple [**Doctor First Name 213**] and complications.  s/p abd
   surgery. Pt is no longer on Humira.  Holding po meds, thus unable to
   take Mesalamine. Will restart when able to tolerate po.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   -1x toradol for increased pain this AM
   - pain control with morphine PCA.
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]
   - speak with surgery regarding pain control.  Pt would likely benefit
   from some basal pain control in addition to the PCA pump.

   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop from yesterday.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Patient remains asymptomatic.
   - check PM hematocrit

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She was recently admitted to the ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip due to tachycardia and pain post-op.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.2°C, HR: 75 bpm, BP: 89/44 mmHg, RR: 18 insp/min, SpO2: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AF (atrial fibrillation)
* Fluid balance: Total input 3,622 mL, total output 2,500 mL, with a balance of 1,122 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device nasal cannula, SpO2 96%, ABG: //25/
* Labs: WBC 12.4, Hct 32.4, Plt 454, Cr 0.5, Glucose 112, Other labs pending

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Hypotension: The patient's BP is currently 89/44 mmHg, which is low. This could be due to the lopressor medication, and the patient's surgery team may need to reassess their dosing.
* Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction and has undergone jejunal resection. Monitor for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome, such as increasing pain, tachycardia, and decreased urine output.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are currently 112 mg/dL, which is high. Tight glucose control is important for wound healing and to prevent further complications.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped 5 points from yesterday, and it is important to monitor for signs of active bleeding or other causes of anemia.
* Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain post-op and is currently on a PCA pump. However, the surgery team may need to reassess their pain management plan to ensure the patient is adequately controlled.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications. The ICU team should continue to work closely with the patient's surgery team to ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was controlled. Pt recently placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   transitioned to PO and returned to surgery. Given pt's surgery for SBO
   and need for NPO, pt in ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip. Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op. Pt is NPO including
   medications.  Patient had high residuals and was not absorbing
   diltiazem PO, placed back on IV diltiazem.
   - would favor dilt drip, will talk with surgery
   - continue Metoprolol 20 mg IV Q4H
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   - transistion to PO meds as tolerated, will consult surgery for when
   she can start taking PO

   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries, including jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/small bowel obstruction (SBO). She presented with a-fib with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) after jejunal resection for SBO. The patient is currently in the ICU for rate control with diltiazem drip, pain management, and close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and her physical examination is notable for obesity, abdominal binder, and dressings with serosanguinous fluid.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance. Her medication list includes diltiazem, metoprolol, morphine, and lorazepam, and she is currently receiving IV fluids, TPN with lipids, and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal surgery and presence of JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the use of lopressor may exacerbate this issue.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure early detection of any changes.
4. Infection: The patient's presence of JP drains and serosanguinous fluid increases the risk of infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not addressed promptly.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may contribute to delayed healing and increase the risk of complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not addressed promptly.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her history of Crohn's disease and prolonged immobility.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her post-operative status and use of prophylactic medications.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to her presence in the ICU and use of invasive lines and tubes."

 CALLED OUT
   - surgery ok with pt taking PO drugs, restarted on PO dilt via NGT
   - given lopressor 10mg x 2 instead of lopressor 20mg x 2 overnight
   because of concerns of hypotension.  After lopressor given, SBP would
   go down to 80s-90s
   - lopressor held once for low BP
   - AM dose of lopressor held to 2.5 mg
   - patient complaining that it's difficult to sleep on PCA pump, have to
   wake up to push the button.  ICU team wanted to add basal dose of
   morphine via PCA pump for more constant pain control.  Surgery wanted
   to switch to fentanyl patch.
   - pt switched from PCA pump to fentanyl patch with IV morphine for
   breakthrough pain with adequate pain management.  Surgery wants to put
   patient back on PCA pump with max dose of 10mg/hr despite low BPs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   morphine via PCA pump for more constant pain control.  Surgery wanted
   to switch to fentanyl patch.
   - pt switched from PCA pump to fentanyl patch with IV morphine for
   breakthrough pain with adequate pain management.  Surgery wants to put
   patient back on PCA pump with max dose of 10mg/hr despite low BPs
   - called out to surgery, sign out given, awaiting transfer

 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   52-year-old female with PMH significant for Crohn's Disease requiring
   multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation who presents with a-fib
   w/ RVR after jejunal resection for jejunal stricture/SBO.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
    She was controlled on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID at home.
   In [**Name (NI) 1**], Pt is tolerating PO diltiazem given via NGT.  Metoprolol IV
   was held to lower doses overnight due to hypotension.  HR has been
   controled in 70-120
s range.
 continue PO dilt via NGT
   - would consider decreasing metoprolol to 5-10 mg IV q4hrs, or even
   decreasing the frequency that patient gets it
   - cont telemetry
   - hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: s/p jejunal resection for SBO at transition point
   of prior anastamoses. Pt being followed by surgery. Pt with colostomy
   and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.
   - monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Vanco/Levo/Flagyl per surgery
   - pain control as per surgical recommendations
   - Zofran 8mg IV q8h:prn
   - NPO including meds except PO diltiazem, cont NG tube
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF maintenence LR 20cc/hr given pt's diastolic dysfunction.
   - T&S good through [**2176-9-23**]

   # Anemia
 patient had a 5 pt hematocrit drop two days ago.  No signs
   of active bleeding.  Hct 27.6 today, stable.  Patient remains
   asymptomatic.
   - continue to monitor CBC daily

   # Hyperglycemia - FSBS 150s. Pt is pre-diabetic per OMR. [**Month (only) 51**] also be
   contribution of increased glucose due to post op stress/pain. Not on
   oral glycemics at baseline. Tight glucose control will help with
   healing.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history, including Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She is currently in the ICU following jejunal resection for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and intussusception.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (IPM)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is currently being treated with metoprolol IV and diltiazem via nasogastric tube (NGT). Her cardiac status is being closely monitored.

The patient has a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and intussusception, which is being managed with NG tube decompression and IV fluids. She has a colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 27.6%
* White blood cell count: 12.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 324 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO) and intussusception
* Anemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Crohn's disease

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue PO diltiazem via NGT
* Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
* Maintain MAPS >60
* IVF maintenance with LR 20cc/hr
* Monitor drain output and UOP >30cc/hr
* Tight glucose control to aid in healing
* Restart PO meds when able to tolerate
* Hold on anti-coagulation given recent surgery

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anemia
* Complications from small bowel obstruction (SBO) and intussusception
* Hyperglycemic emergencies
* Crohn's disease flares

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition to prevent or manage these potential complications."
