 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   .
   .
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neurosurg team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurosurg ~ 1 month.
   - Maintain SBP < 160 with IV meds until mental status improved, then
   change to PO.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output improved
   with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so evening dose of ddAVP was held.
   This morning making 300ccs/hour of urine with .  Endocrine following;
   per note can also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so
   need to watch Na closely.  Appears euvolemic with stable Nas.  Output
   is decreasing.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]??
   - Match output with IVFs as needed -> will increase LR.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  Was
   initially requiring high doses on insulin, now on ~5/hr.  Not eating
   well yet.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - Now on subcu regimen, with long-acting lantus, prandial humalog and
   humalog sliding scale.
   - needs insulin teaching if ?planning on eventual DC home.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved since this AM, though still quite lethargic. Per
   neurosurgery, has been this way since very beginning of course.
   Normoglycemic.  Nonfocal on neuro checks.  Last head CT stable on
   [**10-29**].
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input.
   - Continue neurochecks.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed - somewhat
   limited, though with frequent desaturations to 60's.  Started on CPAP
   at night with oxygen during the day (as sleeping frequently.   Probably
   mixed central and obstructive.  Macroglossia on exam likely
   contributing to obstructive component.
   - continue CPAP on autoset with supplemental O2.
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - will discuss with sleep re: possible devices for management of
   central apnea as well (oscillator or CPAP with dead space).
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Elevated WBCs since surgery.  New fever to 100.8
   today.
   - Culture.
   - Recheck CXR in AM.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   - Monitor surgical site.
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: ICU for now, plan to send to floor once off insulin gtt and
   neuro check requirements have decreased. `

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little to no significance, presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression on October 28th, and is currently being managed in the MICU for continued endocrine management. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.2°C, Tcurrent 37.2°C, HR 73 bpm, BP 128/57 mmHg, RR 17 insp/min, SpO2 97%
* Neurological status: Lethargic, but arousable, with intact cranial nerves II-XII and grossly intact sensation. Strength exam shows 3-4/5 in proximal RUE muscles, 4+/5 in all muscles of LUE, and [5-3] in all LE muscles.
* Endocrine status: Diabetes insipidus, hyperglycemia, and acromegaly. The patient is currently on subcutaneous insulin regimen, and his glucose levels are being closely monitored.
* Respiratory status: Receiving CPAP at night with supplemental O2, and oxygen during the day.
* Cardiovascular status: Stable, with a blood pressure of 128/57 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are being closely monitored, and he is currently on a subcutaneous insulin regimen. However, there is a risk of hyperglycemic crises or ketoacidosis if his glucose levels become too high.
* Diabetes insipidus: The patient's urine output is being closely monitored, and he is at risk of developing hypernatremia or hyponatremia if his sodium levels become too high or too low.
* Lethargy: The patient's lethargy is being attributed to the pituitary macroadenoma, but there is a risk of prolonged lethargy or altered mental status if his sodium levels become too high or too low.
* Central/obstructive sleep apnea: The patient is being managed with CPAP at night with supplemental O2, but there is a risk of respiratory failure or cardiac arrest if his apnea becomes severe.
* Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has a new fever to 100.8°C, and his WBCs are elevated. There is a risk of sepsis or septic shock if his infection is not promptly treated.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's urine output is decreasing, and he is at risk of developing hyponatremia if his sodium levels become too low.

Recommendations:

* Continue to closely monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's urine output and sodium levels closely, and adjust his ddAVP regimen as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's central/obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP at night with supplemental O2.
* Monitor the patient's fever and leukocytosis closely, and adjust his antibiotic regimen as necessary.
* Continue to closely monitor the patient's neurological status, and adjust his sedating and pain medications as necessary.
* Consider consulting with a sleep specialist to discuss possible devices for management of central apnea.
* Consider consulting with an endocrinologist to discuss possible treatment options for the patient's pituitary macroadenoma."

   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   .
   .
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neuro [**Doctor First Name **] team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Is tolerating PO meds without difficulty.  To
   simplify regimen will convert to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and reassess need
   to titrate up dose.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  This morning making 300ccs/hour of
   urine with increased hyponatremia.  Endocrine following; per note can
   also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to watch
   Na closely.  Today we will restart ddAVP to decrease fluid output, with
   the plan to limit the amount of free water to tree hyponatremia.  We
   will try having him meet his fluid demands himself with free access to
   water.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  He
   may have decreasing insulin requirements after his body equilibrates
   with lower glucose levels.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - Now on subcu regimen, with long-acting lantus, prandial humalog and
   humalog sliding scale.
   - If he leaves on sub-cu insulin, which is likely given his high doses
   of insulin, he will need significant teaching to allow for home
   management.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved now that he was sitting up in chair with less
   lethargy but he still gave mostly monosyllabic answers.  Unclear
   whether language barrier plays a role
 last night he did not give more
   info with interpreter. Per neurosurgery, has been this way since very
   beginning of course.
   - Discuss with family how his current status compares to his baseline.
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input if no source can be found with data gathering.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - discuss with neurosurg time-course of when CPAP would be possible.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   up in the chair.  Still some question of language barrier vs
   significant lack of attention when trying to maintain conversation.
   HEENT: Crani sites with intact sutures and staples.  Asymmetric facial
   edema R>L including moderate periorbital edema making it difficult to
   open his eyes.  PERRL 3->2.  OP clear, enlarged tongue midline.
   Sensation intact.
   Chest: CTA bilat, somewhat poor effort.
   Heart: RRR S1 S2, no m/r/g.
   Abdomen: slightly distended, +BS, nontender.  No HSM or mass.
   Extrem: RUE with deformity and overall decrease in size with fixed
   flexion at wrist and hand.  LUE with large bony structure.  Feet
   bilateral very large in size.  No edema or rash. 2+ pulses
   Neuro: Lethargic as above.  CN II-XII intact.  Sensation grossly
   intact.  Strength exam incomplete because of poor cooperation.  Except
   for RUE, appears to be [**5-3**] when fully participatory.  Oriented to
   hospital, [**Month (only) 1961**], reports surgery as 2 days ago (was 3 days ago).

   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   .
   .
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neuro [**Doctor First Name **] team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Is tolerating PO meds without difficulty.  To
   simplify regimen will convert to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and reassess need
   to titrate up dose.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  This morning making 300ccs/hour of
   urine with increased hyponatremia.  Endocrine following; per note can
   also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to watch
   Na closely.  Today we will restart ddAVP to decrease fluid output, with
   the plan to limit the amount of free water to tree hyponatremia.  We
   will try having him meet his fluid demands himself with free access to
   water.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  He
   may have decreasing insulin requirements after his body equilibrates
   with lower glucose levels.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - Now on subcu regimen, with long-acting lantus, prandial humalog and
   humalog sliding scale.
   - If he leaves on sub-cu insulin, which is likely given his high doses
   of insulin, he will need significant teaching to allow for home
   management.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved now that he was sitting up in chair with less
   lethargy but he still gave mostly monosyllabic answers.  Unclear
   whether language barrier plays a role
 last night he did not give more
   info with interpreter. Per neurosurgery, has been this way since very
   beginning of course.
   - Discuss with family how his current status compares to his baseline.
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input if no source can be found with data gathering.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - discuss with neurosurg time-course of when CPAP would be possible.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen, will discuss with neurosurg whether SC

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little significance, who presented with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**] and is currently stable from a surgical standpoint. The patient is being managed for diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, hyperglycemia, and airway management.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose levels: 295, 176, 171, 140
* Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): 17
* Insulin levels: 296, 5
* Electrolyte levels: sodium (Na): 132, potassium (K): 3.7, chloride (Cl): 99, magnesium (Mg): 1.6, phosphorus (PO4): 2.9

The patient is being treated with:

* Subcutaneous insulin regimen, including long-acting Lantus, prandial Humalog, and sliding scale Humalog
* Hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs for steroid therapy
* ddAVP 2 mcg for diabetes insipidus
* Metoprolol 25mg for blood pressure management

The patient's medical complications include:

* Lethargy, which has improved with sitting up in a chair but still requires further evaluation
* Central/obstructive sleep apnea, with a sleep study performed and frequent desaturations to 60's
* Fever/leukocytosis, which has improved but remains a concern
* Potential for central nervous system (CNS) complications, including seizures and increased intracranial pressure

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to monitor Na levels and adjust ddAVP as needed
* Restart ddAVP to decrease fluid output and limit free water intake
* Continue to monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin regimen as needed
* Discuss with family how the patient's current status compares to his baseline
* Consider neuro input if no source can be found for lethargy
* Discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time
* Hold sedating meds and pain meds
* Consider CPAP for central/obstructive sleep apnea
* Continue to monitor for fever/leukocytosis and adjust antibiotics as needed

The patient's potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of lethargy or CNS complications
* Development of respiratory failure or sleep apnea
* Increased risk of infection or sepsis
* Hemorrhage or other complications from craniotomy and decompression
* Insulin resistance or hypoglycemia from insulin therapy
* Electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders from fluid and electrolyte management"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Glucose: 295 (176-171-140)

The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type I, and hyperglycemia. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, and cough due to their inability to protect their airway.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's inability to protect their airway
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's high white blood cell count and potential infection
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's high blood pressure and potential cardiac dysfunction
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's high creatinine levels
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's high risk of aspiration and potential gastrointestinal bleeding

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Hold PM ddAVP and reassess in the morning

   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   .
   .
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression.  Presenting with
   DM and high insulin requirements and clinical features of acromegaly.
   Had craniotomy on [**10-28**] with decompression, now stable from surgical
   standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they could
   consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neurosurg team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurosurg ~ 1 month.
   - Maintain SBP < 160 with IV meds until mental status improved, then
   change to PO.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs.
   .
   # Diabetes insipidus.  Likely due to recent decompression.  Unclear if
   was exhibiting signs of DI prior to surgery (output now well recorded
   on the floor) - was having polydipsia/polyuria but also had increased
   glucoses and likely osmotic diuresis.  Endocrine following; per note
   can also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to
   watch Na closely.  Appears euvolemic with stable Nas.  Output is
   decreasing.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Match output with IVFs as needed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.  Was
   initially requiring high doses on insulin, now on ~5/hr.  Not eating
   well yet.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will continue on insulin gtt for now, with plan to transition to
   subcutaneous regimen possibly tonight.  Was previously on ~80 lantus
   with 15 of humalog plus sliding scale.
   - needs insulin teaching if ?planning on eventual DC home.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved since this AM, though still quite lethargic. Per
   neurosurgery, has been this way since very beginning of course.
   Normoglycemic.  Nonfocal on neuro checks.  Last head CT stable on
   [**10-29**].
   - Check with endocrine re: can lethargy be attributed to macroadenoma.
   - Consider neuro input.
   - Continue neurochecks.
   - Will discuss with neurosurg re: mental status over time.
   - ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   .
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed - somewhat
   limited, though with frequent desaturations to 60's.  Started on CPAP
   at night with oxygen during the day (as sleeping frequently.   Probably
   mixed central and obstructive.  Macroglossia on exam likely
   contributing to obstructive component.
   - continue CPAP on autoset with supplemental O2.
   - appreciate sleep recs
   - will discuss with sleep re: possible devices for management of
   central apnea as well (oscillator or CPAP with dead space).
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Elevated WBCs since surgery.  New fever to 100.8
   today.
   - Culture.
   - Recheck CXR in AM.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   - Monitor surgical site.
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: ICU for now, plan to send to floor once off insulin gtt and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Had craniotomy on [**10-28**] with decompression, now stable from surgical
   standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they could
   consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neurosurg team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per neurosurg ~ 1 month.
   - Maintain SBP < 160 with IV meds until mental status improved, then
   change to PO.
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs.

   # Diabetes insipidus.  Likely due to recent decompression.  Unclear if
   was exhibiting signs of DI prior to surgery (output now well recorded
   on the floor) - was having polydipsia/polyuria but also had increased
   glucoses and likely osmotic diuresis.  Endocrine following; per note
   can also see SIADH picture following this type of surgery, so need to
   watch Na closely.  Appears euvolemic with stable Nas.  Output is
   decreasing.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - ddAVP at 2 mcg [**Hospital1 **]

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a pituitary macroadenoma and suprasellar extension who underwent craniotomy and decompression. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for continued endocrine management. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, and hyperglycemia, which is likely secondary to the pituitary tumor. He also has features of acromegaly and requires high insulin doses. The patient is lethargic, but his mental status has improved since the morning. He has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and a new fever of 100.8°F today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Central/obstructive sleep apnea: The patient's macroglossia and possible mixed central and obstructive sleep apnea may require further management, including devices for central apnea.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely secondary to the pituitary tumor and may require continued insulin therapy.
3. Diabetes insipidus: The patient's recent decompression may have caused diabetes insipidus, which requires close monitoring of sodium levels and output.
4. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy may be related to the pituitary macroadenoma, and further evaluation by neurosurgery may be necessary.
5. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's new fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor eating habits and high insulin requirements may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which need to be addressed.
7. Potential for surgical site infection: The patient's recent surgery and fever may increase the risk of surgical site infection, which requires close monitoring.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's central/obstructive sleep apnea and possible respiratory compromise may require close monitoring and treatment.
10. Endocrine instability: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma and suprasellar extension may cause endocrine instability, which requires close monitoring and treatment by an endocrinologist."

   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now; will discuss needed frequency with
   neuro [**Doctor First Name **] team.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Continue to monitor Na per endo recs.
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little significance, presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent a craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**] and is currently being managed in the MICU for endocrine issues.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including:

1. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient had a sleep study performed, which revealed periodic breathing with central apnea. He would benefit from O2 at night when clinically appropriate.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has been hyponatremic, with a serum Na of 134, and is being managed with ddAVP.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has been hyperglycemic, with a HA1C of 17, and is being managed with insulin therapy.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, and he is currently on 20 Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
5. Lethargy: The patient was previously normal until a month ago, when he started experiencing lethargy. His endocrine team is following up to determine if this lethargy can be attributed to the pituitary adenoma.
6. Central/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient had a sleep study performed, which revealed frequent desaturations to the 60's. He would benefit from positive pressure at night.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's sleep apnea and hypercapnia can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and hyperglycemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent surgery can increase his risk of infection.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma and decompression can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, cerebral edema, or pituitary hormone deficiencies.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's ongoing fluid and electrolyte imbalance can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, or cerebral edema.
6. Insulin resistance: The patient's type I diabetes and hyperglycemia can lead to insulin resistance, which can worsen his glycemic control.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Famotidine (Pepcid)
2. Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis)
3. Infusions (insulin, glucose)
4. Hydrocortisone
5. Metoprolol
6. Keppra
7. ddAVP

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Hyperglycemia: Blood glucose levels have been elevated, with a range of 140-295 mg/dL.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has been hyponatremic, with a serum Na of 134.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, with a range of 12.1-20.4 K/uL.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, with a range of 262-375 K/uL.

The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total fluid intake of 8,572 mL and a total fluid output of 7,910 mL. His urine output has been variable, with a range of 500-600 mL/hour to <100 mL/hour.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue ddAVP to manage his electrolyte imbalance.
2. Monitor his blood sugars closely and adjust his insulin therapy as needed.
3. Continue his anti-diabetic medications, including Humalog and Glargine.
4. Monitor his respiratory status and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
5. Continue his pain management and sedation medications as needed.
6. Monitor his neurological status and consider a neurology consult if necessary.
7. Consider a physical therapy consult to gauge the patient's need for rehabilitation.
8. Work with case management to set up services for the patient's discharge."

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Will get pm urine and serum lytes, f/u UOP through the day, and
   reassess need for further ddAVP
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   - Need to f/u with NSurg re: when can initiate given recent surgery
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   - hold off on ABx for now
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: He needs a PT consult to gauge whether patient will need
   rehab.  He does not have insurance and we should begin to work with
   case management about setting up services when he is discharged. Stable
   to call out to floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key points and potential medical complications:

**Key Points:**

1. The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and pituitary macroadenoma who underwent craniotomy and decompression on [**10-28**].
2. He is currently in the ICU for continued endocrine management and has been experiencing hyperglycemia, lethargy, and central sleep apnea.
3. He has been prescribed ddAVP to manage diabetes insipidus, and his urine output has decreased to a more manageable amount.
4. His fluid balance has been mostly maintained with PO intake, and he is being closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
5. He has been started on subQ heparin for prophylaxis against DVT and H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. His airway is at risk due to his inability to protect it, and he is at risk for aspiration, altered gag, and airway clearance.
7. He has been prescribed insulin and is being closely monitored for blood sugar control.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, but there is a risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia, due to the ddAVP therapy.
2. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and managed promptly.
3. **Aspiration:** The patient's inability to protect his airway puts him at risk for aspiration, which can lead to respiratory complications.
4. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's central sleep apnea may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
5. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis, if not properly managed.
6. **Cerebral Edema:** The patient's pituitary macroadenoma and recent decompression may lead to cerebral edema, which can cause neurological complications.
7. **Inadequate Pain Management:** The patient's pain needs to be properly managed to avoid complications, such as respiratory depression.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,

   28M with little past medical history presenting with hyperglycemia,
   features of acromegaly, found to have pituitary macroadenoma with
   suprasellar extension now s/p craniotomy and decompression; now
   transferred to MICU service for continued endocrine management.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - f/u IGF1 and [**Hospital1 **] levels.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.  Had been hypernatremic with polyuria
   consistent with DI due to recent decompression.  Urine output decreased
   to a more manageable amount with ddAVP but is now hyponatremic, so
   evening dose of ddAVP was held.  Over yesterday was making a large amt
   of urine (500-600 per hour) but has decreased to <100/hr earlier this
   am after getting ddAVP. His fluid has been balanced mostly with PO
   intake.
   - Will get pm urine and serum lytes, f/u UOP through the day, and
   reassess need for further ddAVP
   - F/u Endo recs re: further ddAVP
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   - Need to f/u with NSurg re: when can initiate given recent surgery
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   - hold off on ABx for now
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: He needs a PT consult to gauge whether patient will need
   rehab.  He does not have insurance and we should begin to work with
   case management about setting up services when he is discharged. Stable
   to call out to floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Family meeting: baseline is active, able to walk and normal mental
   status, for past month has been having left sided weakness, shortness
   of breath, lethargy and abnormal breathing pattern.  Per faimly he
   actually looks better now.
   - Sleep study: Periodic breathing with central apnea, pt would benefit
   from O2 at night when clinically appropriate.
   - Desat's down to 70's when sleeping but slowly comes back up when
   woken up
   - able to concentrate urine without ddavp
   - 2230: increased UOP, still net positive for the day, urine lytes <10
   and serum Na 134 -> restart ddavp
   -still very lethargic
   -started subQ heparin
   -still with a lot of thirst and still making lots of urine

   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 60 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Was pretty normal until a month ago per family, when all
   of this started. Encourage OOB
   - F/u with Endo re: whether this lethargy can be attributed to the pit
   adenoma.
   - Consider Neuro consult if continued
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Consider ABG prn to ensure pCO2 not the cause.
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   - Need to f/u with NSurg re: when can initiate given recent surgery
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  Remains afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  No
   focal source of infection.
   - c/u cultures.
   - hold off on ABx for now
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet as mental status allows.
   # PPX: H2B bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: full
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: He needs a PT consult to gauge whether patient will need
   rehab.  He does not have insurance and we should begin to work with
   case management about setting up services when he is discharged. Stable
   to call out to floor.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of little significance, who presented with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and was found to have a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent a craniotomy and decompression, and is currently being managed in the ICU for continued endocrine management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy with an SpO2 of 100%. He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central apnea, and a sleep study showed periodic breathing with central apnea. He would benefit from positive pressure therapy at night.
* Cardiovascular: His blood pressure is stable, with a mean arterial pressure of 123/64 mmHg. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
* Neurological: He is lethargic, but able to answer questions when awoken. His neurological status is unchanged from admission, except for a recent decrease in urine output.
* Endocrine: He has diabetes insipidus (DI) and is currently receiving desmopressin (ddAVP) to manage his polyuria. His sodium levels have been fluctuating, and he is currently hyponatremic.
* Gastrointestinal: He is on a DM diet, and his blood sugars have been well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.
* Hematological: His white blood cell count is 20.4 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 375 x 10^9/L.
* Renal: His creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 243 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to OSA and central apnea
* Cardiovascular instability due to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate
* Neurological deterioration due to continued lethargy and decreased urine output
* Endocrine complications due to DI and hyperglycemia
* Gastrointestinal complications due to DM diet and potential for hyperglycemia
* Hematological complications due to leukocytosis and potential for infection
* Renal complications due to potential for acute kidney injury (AKI) and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, and renal systems to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall, 85.9 kg (overweight/obese) male who underwent resection of a suprasellar mass. He is currently in the ICU due to his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/98 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, and is being treated with regular insulin sliding scale and Glargine. His glucose levels are well-controlled, with a current level of 158 mg/dL.

The patient is also receiving DDAVP for his polyuria, and his urine output is copious. He is at risk for electrolyte and fluid disorders due to his diabetes and polyuria.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with lethargy and altered mental status. He is unable to provide a history and is encephalopathic. He has a history of thyroid disease and pituitary resection.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a craniotomy site, and he has no acute distress. His respiratory status is stable, with clear breath sounds and no wheezing or crackles.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for:

* Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 20.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 375 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 296 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorders due to his diabetes and polyuria.
2. Respiratory failure due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway.
3. Sepsis or infection due to his encephalopathy and altered immune function.
4. Cardiac complications due to his history of thyroid disease and pituitary resection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that he be transferred to the floor for further management and monitoring. His DDAVP therapy should be continued, and his glucose levels should be closely monitored. His electrolyte and fluid status should also be closely monitored to prevent complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Became hyponatremic to 129 after
   receiving 1mcg ddAVP yesterday.  Did not get a second dose and since
   midnight has been making 500 to 700 ccs of urine an hour.  We still
   think that he has diabetes insipidus secondary to his surgery.  Our
   plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to fluid restrict him afterwards
   to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also stop giving him IV fluids as
   these may be preventing him from self regulating.  We will also consult
   the renal service to get their input on how to manage this complex
   patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 65 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he is profoundly
   apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP in one month
   once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to tolerate
   positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a month
   ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet
   # PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV.  Has difficult access.  Placed order for PICC, but has
   had positive cultures.  Will see if this is possible.
   # CODE: full code
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: The patient ideally would probably go to rehab after
   discharge.  He has no insurance, however, and does not appear to
   qualify for insurance.  There is also some concern about whether his
   family can care for him.  We are working with social work and case

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Became hyponatremic to 129 after
   receiving 1mcg ddAVP yesterday.  Did not get a second dose and since
   midnight has been making 500 to 700 ccs of urine an hour.  We still
   think that he has diabetes insipidus secondary to his surgery.  Our
   plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to fluid restrict him afterwards
   to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also stop giving him IV fluids as
   these may be preventing him from self regulating.  We will also consult
   the renal service to get their input on how to manage this complex
   patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 65 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he is profoundly
   apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP in one month
   once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to tolerate
   positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a month
   ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet
   # PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen, subQ heparin started

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression, and is now experiencing polyuria, intermittent hyponatremia, and persistent somnolence. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, and altered mental status.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Diabetes insipidus/SIADH: He is experiencing polyuria and intermittent hyponatremia, likely due to his surgery.
2. Fever/bacteremia: He has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, and is being treated with vancomycin.
3. Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma: He had a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension, which was removed during surgery.
4. Hyperglycemia: He has a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, and is currently being treated with insulin.
5. Lethargy: He is experiencing lethargy, likely due to sleep apnea.
6. Central/obstructive sleep apnea: He has a sleep study that showed frequent desaturations to 60's, and is being considered for positive pressure therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his polyuria and hyponatremia.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia, due to his SIADH.
3. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures and is at risk for infection.
4. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has induration in his left antecubital fossa, which is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient is at risk for pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting, due to his underlying medical conditions and treatment.

Plan:

1. Continue ddAVP to manage polyuria and hyponatremia.
2. Fluid restrict the patient to 2L of PO intake per day.
3. Continue vancomycin to treat bacteremia.
4. Consult vascular to evaluate the induration in his left antecubital fossa.
5. Consider PT/OT consult to promote ambulation and mobility.
6. Continue endocrine follow-up to monitor the patient's pituitary function.
7. Monitor the patient's blood sugars and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
8. Consider sleep study to evaluate the patient's sleep apnea and potential need for positive pressure therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, and a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He underwent craniotomy and decompression, and is currently in the ICU with polyuria, intermittent hyponatremia, and persistent somnolence. His recent labs show a decrease in sodium levels, likely due to the administration of ddAVP. He has also developed a fever and bacteremia, with positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters. He has a history of acromegaly and pituitary macroadenoma, and is currently on steroid therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are decreasing, which can lead to hyponatremia, a potentially life-threatening condition. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.
2. Infection: The patient has developed a fever and bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure. Administration of antibiotics is necessary, and source control measures should be implemented to prevent further spread of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's sleep apnea is a significant concern, and he may require positive pressure ventilation to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Central nervous system (CNS) complications: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma and recent surgery may lead to CNS complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or seizures.
5. Diabetes insipidus: The patient's polyuria and hyponatremia suggest diabetes insipidus, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not managed properly.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of hyperglycemia and acromegaly may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's recent surgery and immobility may increase his risk of thrombosis, particularly in the context of central venous catheters.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust ddAVP administration accordingly.
2. Administer antibiotics and source control measures to manage the infection.
3. Implement respiratory support measures, such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation, to manage the patient's sleep apnea.
4. Monitor the patient's CNS function and watch for signs of meningitis, encephalitis, or seizures.
5. Manage the patient's diabetes insipidus with ddAVP and fluid management.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
7. Consider thromboprophylaxis measures, such as low-molecular-weight heparin, to reduce the risk of thrombosis."

   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2196-11-3**] 09:13 AM
   - LUE u/s: negative for clot. Not clear if they assessed for an
   abscess.  Radiologist will f/u with tech and call back in AM.
   - On our bedside LUE U/S, patient appears to have a non-compressible
   portion of vein at the site of the induration, consistent with
   thrombophlebitis.
   - Endocrine recs: Hold ddAVP if Na<133, watch out for SIADH which
   typically happens around day 7 post-op.  Reduce hydrocortisone to 25mg
   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.
   - IV access - PICC team thought U/S was to assess for clot, and
   therefore put off PICC pending final radiology read which didn't come
   until 5pm. They will reassess in AM.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Tried trial of fluid restriction without
   ddAVP overnight.  Continued to have very high urine outputs and is now
   negative almost 9 liters in the last 30 hours, with a sodium of 140 and
   very dilute urine.  We are nearly certain from this that he has
   diabetes insipidus.  Given that he is not yet at a sodium level that
   would necessarily limit his urine output, we will fluid restrict him
   further until noon, and then recheck his blood and urine sodium before
   starting ddAVP.  We will then plan on 1mcg of ddAVP [**Hospital1 **], with a plan to
   reduce to one dose daily or a lower dose if his sodium goes low again.
   - appreciate renal and endocrine recs for this complex case.
   - Likely give 1 mcg ddAVP starting after noon today.
   - No IV fluids, with the plan of letting him self-regulate.
   - Lytes at noon and then in late afternoon.
   # Fever/bacteremia: staph epi in blood, now appears to have been in one
   bottle only.  Sensitivities pending.  Unclear whether this is a
   contaminant or seeded from superficial thrombophlebitis.  On day 3 of
   vancomycin.  Our U/S certainly suggested a superficial
   thrombophlebitis.  We will check with vascular surgery whether they
   would prefer to simply treat with vanco or actually remove the infected
   superficial vein.
   - talk to vascular
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  f/u sensitivities.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Discuss with neuro whether Q8hr neuro checks could be appropriate.
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Hydrocortisone 25mg PO q8 this am
   # Hyperglycemia.  Sugars generally in 100s except for one time at 65
   yesterday at 11am.  We will decrease his humalog dose with meals to 15
   units and follow.  Continue Glargine 65 units QHS.  He will need
   DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Much improved today, and may have been partly related to
   recovery from his surgery.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he
   is profoundly apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP
   in one month once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to
   tolerate positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a
   month ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and
   ambulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2196-11-3**] 09:13 AM
   - LUE u/s: negative for clot. Not clear if they assessed for an
   abscess.  Radiologist will f/u with tech and call back in AM.
   - On our bedside LUE U/S, patient appears to have a non-compressible
   portion of vein at the site of the induration, consistent with
   thrombophlebitis.
   - Endocrine recs: Hold ddAVP if Na<133, watch out for SIADH which
   typically happens around day 7 post-op.  Reduce hydrocortisone to 25mg
   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.
   - IV access - PICC team thought U/S was to assess for clot, and
   therefore put off PICC pending final radiology read which didn't come
   until 5pm. They will reassess in AM.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male who underwent craniotomy and decompression for a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes insipidus, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, obstructive sleep apnea, and thrombophlebitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He has a non-compressible portion of vein at the site of induration, consistent with thrombophlebitis, which was not assessed for an abscess during the ultrasound examination.
* He has diabetes insipidus, which was confirmed by his high urine output and dilute urine, and is currently being treated with fluid restriction and ddAVP.
* He has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin and diet.
* He has altered mental status, which is likely related to sleep apnea and is being treated with CPAP.
* He has obstructive sleep apnea, which is being managed with CPAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of diabetes insipidus, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* Development of electrolyte and fluid disorders, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying condition and treatment.
* Increased risk of infection, particularly at the site of the thrombophlebitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's sleep apnea and underlying condition.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy and thrombophlebitis.
* Development of hypoglycemia due to the patient's insulin treatment and potential for insulin overdose.
* Increased risk of cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias, due to the patient's underlying condition and treatment.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Fluid restriction to manage his diabetes insipidus
* ddAVP to treat his diabetes insipidus
* Insulin and diet to manage his hyperglycemia
* CPAP to manage his obstructive sleep apnea
* Vancomycin to treat his thrombophlebitis
* Hydrocortisone to treat his altered mental status
* Metoprolol to manage his hypertension
* Keppra to manage his seizures
* Glargine insulin to manage his hyperglycemia

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, and other specialists."

   therefore put off PICC pending final radiology read which didn't come
   until 5pm. They will reassess in AM.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   28M presenting with hyperglycemia, features of acromegaly, found to
   have pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension now s/p
   craniotomy and decompression; now with polyuria, intermittent
   hyponatremia and persistent somnolence.
   # Diabetes insipidus/SIADH.   Tried trial of fluid restriction without
   ddAVP overnight.  Continued
   Became hyponatremic to 129 after receiving 1mcg ddAVP yesterday.  Did
   not get a second dose and since midnight has been making 500 to 700 ccs
   of urine an hour.  We still think that he has diabetes insipidus
   secondary to his surgery.  Our plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to
   fluid restrict him afterwards to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also
   stop giving him IV fluids as these may be preventing him from self
   regulating.  We will also consult the renal service to get their input
   on how to manage this complex patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 65 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he is profoundly
   apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP in one month
   once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to tolerate
   positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a month
   ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet
   # PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV.  Has difficult access.  Placed order for PICC, but has
   had positive cultures.  Will see if this is possible.
   # CODE: full code
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: The patient ideally would probably go to rehab after
   discharge.  He has no insurance, however, and does not appear to
   qualify for insurance.  There is also some concern about whether his
   family can care for him.  We are working with social work and case
   management.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - LUE u/s: negative for clot. Not clear if they assessed for an
   abscess.  Radiologist will f/u with tech and call back in AM.
   - On our bedside echo, patient appears to have a non-compressible
   portion of vein at the site of the induration, consistent with
   thrombophlebitis.
   - Endocrine recs: Hold ddAVP if Na<133, watch out for SIADH which
   typically happens around day 7 post-op.  Reduce hydrocortisone to 25mg
   IV Q8hrs.
   - Renal recs: hold ddAVP and fluid restrict patient after midnight to
   see what his set point will be.  If sodium rises rapidly or becomes
   hypotensive, stop water deprivation.  If UO continues to be high after
   water deprivation, then give ddAVP.
   - At midnight 6.3L negative for the day! UOP still 450-600ccs per hour.
   - IV access - PICC team thought U/S was to assess for clot, and
   therefore put off PICC pending final radiology read which didn't come

   of urine an hour.  We still think that he has diabetes insipidus
   secondary to his surgery.  Our plan now is to try giving ddAVP, but to
   fluid restrict him afterwards to prevent hyponatremia.  We will also
   stop giving him IV fluids as these may be preventing him from self
   regulating.  We will also consult the renal service to get their input
   on how to manage this complex patient.
   - renal consult
   - Appreciate endocrine recs.
   - Give 1 mcg of ddAVP and restrict to 2L of PO intake afterwards.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Fever/bacteremia: had [**2-1**] positive blood cultures for gram positive
   cocci in clusters.  The induration in his left-sided antecubital fossa
   is concerning for superficial thrombophlebitis and a possible source
   for his positive blood cultures.  He continues to be afebrile with a
   decreasing WBC count, making high-grade bacteremia unlikely.  On day 2
   of vanco and awaiting speciation.  Staph aureus vs epidermis.
   - consult vascular to evaluate this possible.
   - RUE ultrasound to assess for DVT or abscess.
   - continue vancomycin 1mg Q12hours.  If culture is sensitive, will
   consider changing to nafcillin.
   - if staph aureus, consult ID
   - induration on left arm could be a potential source.
   # Acromegaly/pituitary macroadenoma s/p decompression:  s/p craniotomy
   on [**10-28**] with removal of a mass and decompression, now stable from
   surgical standpoint.  No plans to go back to OR; per neurosurg they
   could consider radiation therapy in the future.  IGF and [**Hospital1 **] levels
   confirm that he had hypersecretion and likely acromegaly.
   - Continue Q4H neuro checks for now
   - continue keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one month
   - Maintain SBP < 160.  Currently on Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   - appreciate endocrine following.
   - Continue steroid therapy per endocrine recs
 currently at
   hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs --> but with plan to decrease to 25mg PO q8
   this am
   # Hyperglycemia. Secondary to likely growth hormone secreting pituitary
   tumor as above, vs. more classic DM II.  HA1C 17 during admission.
   Blood sugars were fairly well controlled yesterday, currently on 20
   Humalog tid and 65 Glargine hs with SSI.
   - endocrine following, appreciate recs.
   - will need DM/insulin education
   # Lethargy.  Most likely related to sleep apnea, as he is profoundly
   apneic at times at night.  Plan is to initiate night CPAP in one month
   once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery to tolerate
   positive pressures (per neurosurg).  Was pretty normal until a month
   ago per family, when all of this started. Encourage OOB and ambulation.
   - Encourage OOB
   - Consider PT/OT consult
   - Hold sedating meds and pain meds.
   # Central/obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep study performed with frequent
   desaturations to 60's.  Neurosurgery would like to avoid positive
   pressures  as he had recent surgery
   - Sleep study --> would benefit from pos pressure at night
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / DM diet
   # PPX: H2 blocker, bowel regimen, subQ heparin started
   # ACCESS: PIV.  Has difficult access.  Placed order for PICC, but has
   had positive cultures.  Will see if this is possible.
   # CODE: full code
   # CONTACT: patient, [**Name2 (NI) 757**]
   # DISPO: The patient ideally would probably go to rehab after
   discharge.  He has no insurance, however, and does not appear to
   qualify for insurance.  There is also some concern about whether his
   family can care for him.  We are working with social work and case
   management.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male who underwent craniotomy and decompression for a pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. He has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has a non-compressible portion of vein at the site of induration, consistent with thrombophlebitis. This may be a potential source of bacteremia.
2. Bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which may be related to the thrombophlebitis.
3. Diabetes insipidus: The patient has polyuria, intermittent hyponatremia, and persistent somnolence, which may be secondary to his surgery.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled blood sugars, which may be related to his growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumor or classic type 2 diabetes.
5. Sleep apnea: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea, which may be contributing to his lethargy.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has a complex electrolyte and fluid disorder, which may be related to his diabetes insipidus, hyperglycemia, and surgery.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and thrombophlebitis may lead to sepsis, which could worsen his condition.
2. Worsening hyperglycemia: The patient's uncontrolled blood sugars may lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's intermittent hyponatremia may worsen if he continues to produce large amounts of urine.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's thrombophlebitis may increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's sleep apnea may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment, which could lead to respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving vancomycin for his bacteremia.
2. Fluid restriction: The patient will be restricted to 2L of oral intake to prevent hyponatremia.
3. Diabetes management: The patient will require insulin therapy to control his hyperglycemia.
4. Sleep apnea treatment: The patient will be initiated on night CPAP therapy once he has recovered sufficiently from his surgery.
5. Vascular consult: The patient will be evaluated by a vascular specialist to assess the extent of his thrombophlebitis and potential for DVT or abscess.
6. Endocrine follow-up: The patient will require close follow-up with an endocrinologist to manage his diabetes insipidus and hyperglycemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple potential complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch, 85.9 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and diabetes mellitus, type I. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and thrombophlebitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery at 98% saturation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.9), hematocrit (37.9), and platelet count (322). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level (3.6 mEq/L). The patient's blood cultures show coag-negative staph from one bottle, with sensitivities pending.

The patient's imaging results, including a chest X-ray, appear clear. The patient's urine cultures are negative, and the patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has a non-compressible portion of vein at the site of induration, which may lead to further complications such as embolism or sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures show coag-negative staph, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications if left untreated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery at 98% saturation, which may indicate the presence of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's blood cultures show coag-negative staph, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, which may indicate the presence of organ dysfunction.
7. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, type I, which may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis if left untreated.
8. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a variety of factors, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects."
