   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  Unlikely to be haveing significant reaccumilation of
   pericardial fluid.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated
   effusion in the right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past
   - continue dapsone and fluconazole
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis
   - urine lytes
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, CD4 count of 1, who presented with 2 days of worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, and a window was performed on [**2113-9-1**]. He was transferred to the CCU with fevers, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL
* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase)
* Supratherapeutic vancomycin levels
* Hypocalcemia (Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL)
* Hyperphosphatemia (PO4: 3.0 mg/dL)
* Hypomagnesemia (Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL)
* Anemia (Hct: 25.4%)
* Thrombocytopenia (Plt: 159 K/uL)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute renal failure
* Rash
* Fever of unknown origin
* Pericardial effusion with tamponade
* Anxiety
* Diarrhea
* Airway obstruction
* HIV/AIDS
* Myopericarditis
* Pulmonary nodule (possibly Kaposi's sarcoma)
* Hypocalcemia
* Hyperphosphatemia
* Hypomagnesemia

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Reaccumulation of pericardial fluid
* Pneumonia
* Empyema
* ARDS
* Cardiac tamponade
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure progression
* Infection (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, or empyema)
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia)

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his conditions, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antiretroviral therapy. Further management and monitoring are necessary to address the patient's ongoing medical issues and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing

   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline

   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection

   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, is admitted to the ICU with worsening sternal chest pain, fevers, and hypoxia. He has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which was managed with a window on [**2113-9-1**]. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, fluconazole, and doxycycline. He has a CD4 count of 1 and a viral load of 30K, and is enrolled in an experimental study. The patient has a history of CMV retinitis, esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infectious etiology:** The patient's fever, sinus tachycardia, and supratherapeutic vancomycin levels suggest an infectious etiology, possibly related to GPC in the pericardial tissue and fluid. The patient's history of MRSA infection and positive enzymes in the pericardial fluid also raise concerns.
2. **Pericarditis and tamponade:** The patient's rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology requires close monitoring, and the patient may require further interventions to manage the effusion.
3. **Hypoxia:** The patient's hypoxia may be related to volume overload, PNA with bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, or empyema. Further evaluation, including CXR and I/O, is needed to determine the cause.
4. **ARF:** The patient's creatinine level of 2.8 suggests acute renal failure, which may be related to drug toxicity, cardiorenal syndrome, or other factors. Further evaluation, including urine lytes and phosphate levels, is needed to determine the cause.
5. **Depressed EF:** The patient's depressed EF may be related to myopericarditis, which requires further evaluation and management.
6. **Pulmonary nodule:** The patient's small pulmonary nodules raise concerns for Kaposi's sarcoma, which requires further evaluation and follow-up.
7. **HCT drop:** The patient's HCT drop from 40.8 to 30.4 over 3 months suggests a possible bleeding disorder, which requires further evaluation.
8. **FEN:** The patient's regular diet and replete electrolytes suggest that his nutritional needs are being met, but further evaluation is needed to determine if he requires additional support.
9. **PPx:** The patient's PPI and hold on heparin suggest that he may be at risk for bleeding complications, which requires further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications, including infectious etiology, pericarditis, hypoxia, ARF, depressed EF, pulmonary nodule, HCT drop, and FEN."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 30.4 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.
   - guiac stools
   - q24 hct  .
   # FEN: regular diet, replete e's prn,

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, CD4 count of 1, and a history of CMV retinitis, esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection. He was admitted with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and was transferred to the CCU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: Suppressive therapy with vancomycin is being continued, and daily levels will be checked to adjust the dose if necessary.
* Sinus tachycardia: Most likely due to an infectious etiology, and GPC in the pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.
* Hypoxia: Most likely due to volume overload, and repeat CXR and i/o are planned.
* ARF: Unclear etiology, and drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome is possible.
* Depressed EF: Most likely due to myopericarditis, and repeat TTE is planned.
* Pulmonary nodule: Small pulmonary nodules with soft tissue in a periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raise the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma.
* HCT: Drop in HCT from 40.8 to 30.4 over 3 months, and guiac stools and q24 hct are planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further progression of pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Nephrotoxicity from antiretrovirals
* Malignancy, such as Kaposi's sarcoma
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Septic shock or multi-organ failure

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical course."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. The patient has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and was transferred to the CCU.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels
* Supratherapeutic vancomycin levels
* CD4 count of 1, indicating advanced immunodeficiency
* HIV viral load of 30,000
* Positive enzyme levels suggesting myocarditis
* Negative influenza panel and PCP sputum
* Elevated creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia
* Respiratory distress with apical wheezes bilaterally
* Soft abdomen with no organomegaly
* Lower extremity edema

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Infectious etiology for fever and sinus tachycardia
* Concern for GPC in pericardial tissue and fluid
* Myocarditis and pulmonary etiology for hypoxia
* Unclear etiology for acute renal failure
* Periwindow TTE showing depressed EF likely due to myopericarditis
* Small pulmonary nodules raising the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma
* Drop in HCT from 40.8 to 30.4 over 3 months, with no signs of active bleeding

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Pericardial tamponade
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Hypotension
* Infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral)
* Cardiorenal syndrome
* Nephrotoxicity from antiretrovirals
* Kaposi's sarcoma progression
* Cryptococcal infection recurrence

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin therapy
* Fluconazole and doxycycline therapy
* Repeat TTE and CTA
* Blood cultures and tissue cultures
* AFB cultures
* Negative pressure room until TB is ruled out
* Crypto titer trending down, unlikely representing new or untreated infection
* ARF management, including urine lytes and renal consult if necessary
* Depressed EF management, including repeat TTE and consideration of cardiac medications
* Pulmonary nodule follow-up and consideration of biopsy
* HCT monitoring and guiac stools
* FEN and PPx management

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending clinical course."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

The patient is a 46-year-old man with advanced AIDS, who presented with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. He has a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and was found to have myocarditis with positive enzymes.

**Potential Complications:**

1. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's fever, sinus tachycardia, and pericardial effusion suggest an infectious etiology. The patient has a history of MRSA infection, and the presence of GPC in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning. The patient is also at risk for pulmonary complications, including pneumonia, given his AIDS diagnosis and history of PCP sputum-negative pneumonia.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's depressed EF and myopericarditis suggest cardiac complications. The patient's creatinine level is 2.7, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload, PNA, or bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.
3. **Renal Complications:** The patient's AKI may be due to drug toxicity (tenofivir) or cardiorenal syndrome. The patient's urine phosphorus level is 11.3, which is consistent with tenofivir nephrotoxicity.
4. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's small pulmonary nodules may be indicative of Kaposi's sarcoma. The patient's right pleural lesion on CT may represent a loculated fluid collection or an untreated infection.
5. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 40.8 to 24.2 over a 3-month period, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or anemia.
6. **Thrombotic Complications:** The patient is at risk for thrombotic complications, including DVT and pulmonary embolism, given his AIDS diagnosis and history of MRSA infection.
7. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, but he may be at risk for malnutrition given his AIDS diagnosis and history of gastrointestinal complications.

**Plan:**

1. Continue vanc and adjust dose based on creatinine level.
2. Continue fluconazole and azithromycin.
3. Follow up labs, including anaplasma, lyme, CMV, and RMSF.
4. Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, hypoxia, and sinus tachycardia.
5. Repeat TTE to monitor cardiac function.
6. Consider renal consult if renal function does not improve.
7. Hold off further diuresis in the patient as he appears euvolumic.
8. Consider outpatient follow-up for pulmonary nodules and right pleural lesion.
9. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or anemia.
10. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent thrombotic complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, CD4 count of 1, and a history of various infections, including CMV retinitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection. He was admitted with fever, chest pain, and tachypnea and was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. He underwent a window procedure and was transferred to the CCU. The patient's current condition includes fever, sinus tachycardia, hypoxia, and possible pulmonary nodules.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infectious etiology:** The patient's fever and sinus tachycardia may be due to an infectious etiology, possibly related to the pericardial effusion or pulmonary nodules.
2. **Pulmonary complications:** The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload, pneumonia, or empyema. The presence of bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on CXR suggests pneumonia.
3. **Renal failure:** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the urine phosphorus level is high, suggesting possible tenofivir nephrotoxicity.
4. **Cardiac complications:** The patient's depressed EF may be due to myopericarditis, and the presence of pulmonary nodules raises the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma.
5. **Gastrointestinal complications:** The patient's HCT has dropped significantly over the past three months, and he may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. **Coagulopathy:** The patient is at risk for coagulopathy due to his history of disseminated Cryptococcus infection and possible pericarditis.
7. **Catheter-related complications:** The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, which may increase the risk of catheter-related complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuation of vanc, fluconazole, and azithromycin
* Renal adjustment of vanc dose
* F/u labs, blood cultures, tissue and pericardial fluid cultures, and AFB cultures
* Awaiting MRSA sensitivities to Daptomycin and Linezolid
* Crypto titer trending down, unlikely representing new or untreated infection
* Repeat TTE to assess cardiac function
* Renal consult if renal function not improving
* Hold off further diuresis as the patient appears euvolumic
* Regular follow-up with outpatient providers to monitor for pulmonary nodules and gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, chest pain, and tachypnea. The patient's condition has improved somewhat overnight, with a decrease in sinus tachycardia. Cultures have been negative to date. The patient is receiving anti-retroviral and antibiotic regimens. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/76 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and tachypnea may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, which may indicate respiratory muscle fatigue or pneumonia.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia may indicate cardiac strain or underlying cardiac disease.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or pancreatitis.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and potassium levels may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may indicate a coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is low, which may indicate malnutrition or malabsorption.
8. Medication-Related Complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and antiretroviral therapy, which could interact with each other or cause adverse effects.
9. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may indicate delirium, which could be caused by medications, infection, or underlying medical conditions.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and skin breakdown may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.

Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an elderly individual, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, chest pain, and tachypnea. The patient's condition has remained stable, with no complaints reported today. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a heart rate of 115 bpm, which is slightly elevated. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95% and no need for supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures have been negative to date. The patient's medications include anti-retroviral and antibiotic regimens, as well as other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and slightly elevated heart rate may indicate underlying respiratory distress. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and negative blood and urine cultures may indicate an ongoing infection. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's fever.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated blood pressure may indicate underlying cardiovascular disease. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular status is necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and decreased level of consciousness may indicate underlying neurological disease. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's neurological symptoms.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's decreased appetite and nausea may indicate underlying gastrointestinal disease. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.
6. Renal complications: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate underlying renal disease. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's renal symptoms.
7. Hepatic complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate underlying hepatic disease. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's hepatic symptoms."

   Assessment and Plan
HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME,
   AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 30.4 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.
   - guiac stools
   - q24 hct  .

   Assessment and Plan
HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME,
   AIDS)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc levels
   supratherapeutic. Will check daily levels and dose if Vanc level <20
   - continuing fluconazole, doxycycline
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - repeat TTE ordered on the floor
   - negative pressure room till TB is ruled out. Final sputum is due back
   today. Once TB has been ruled out Pt can be taken off respiratory
   precautions
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u i/o, pt currently autodiuresing
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   - d/c linezolid as pt has completed course of treatment for MRSA
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.8
   - urine lytes
   -Will check urine phosphate to evaluate for possible nephrotoxicity
   from antiretrovirals
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix
   .
   # Pulmonary nodule:  Small pulmonary nodules with the soft tissue in a
   periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution raises the possibility
   of Kaposi's sarcoma.
   - need out patient followup
   - right pleural lesion on CT described as loculated fluid, will need to
   be followed up to r/u untreated infection vs. malignancy
   .
   # HCT - drop to 30.4 from 40.8 over 3 month period. Does not describe
   blood in stool or urine. No signs of active bleeding.
   - guiac stools
   - q24 hct  .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS and a CD4 count of 1, who was admitted with worsening sternal chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers, and shaking chills. The patient has a history of CMV retinitis, esophagitis, disseminated Cryptococcus infection, and MRSA soft tissue infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient's temperature has been elevated, ranging from 101°F to 103°F, with a current temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F).
* Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 102-132 beats per minute, with a current heart rate of 115 beats per minute.
* Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, and they require no oxygen delivery device.
* Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which was confirmed by echocardiogram.
* Myopericarditis: The patient has evidence of myopericarditis, with elevated cardiac enzymes.
* Pulmonary nodules: The patient has small pulmonary nodules in a periaortic and peribronchovascular distribution, which raises the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.8 mg/dL, with a drop in hematocrit from 40.8 to 30.4 over the past three months.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion and myopericarditis can lead to cardiac tamponade, cardiac failure, or arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and pulmonary nodules can lead to respiratory failure or worsening of lung function.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and drop in hematocrit can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or anemia.
* Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of infections can lead to new or recurrent infections, including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
* Malignancy: The patient's pulmonary nodules can be a sign of underlying malignancy, such as Kaposi's sarcoma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antiretroviral therapy and monitoring of CD4 count and viral load.
* Monitoring of creatinine level and hematocrit to assess renal function and anemia.
* Repeat echocardiogram to assess pericardial effusion and cardiac function.
* Repeat CT scan to assess pulmonary nodules and potential malignancy.
* Monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function to assess for respiratory complications.
* Monitoring of temperature and cardiac enzymes to assess for cardiac complications.
* Close follow-up with infectious disease and cardiology consultants to assess and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   46 y/o gentleman with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 presents with 2
   days of worsening sternal chest pain causing difficulty breathing,
   fevers to 101 and shaking chills.  He was found to have rapidly
   advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p window on
   [**2113-9-1**].  Now transfered to CCU with fevers, hypoxia and sinus
   tachycardia.
   .
   #. Fever, sinus tachycardia:  Most likely infectious in etiology.  GPC
   in pericardial tissue and fluid is concerning.  ? Also had myocarditis
   with positive enzymes.  ? Pulmonary the primary etiology.  PCP sputum
   negative.  Negative influenza panel.  No evidence of end organ ischemia
   currently.  No significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid per
   ECHO.  CTA on [**2113-8-31**] without PE however had loculated effusion in the
   right lung base.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue vanc given h/o MRSA infx in the past. Currently vanc level
   12.3. Pt will need renally adjusted vanc dose today
   - continuing fluconazole, azithromycin
   - f/u labs (anaplasma, lyme, cmv, RMSF), blood cultures, tissue and
   pericardial fluid cultures, AFB cultures
   - Awaiting MRSA sensitivities to Daptomycin and Linezolid
   - crypto titer trending down compared to prior data, unlikely
   representing new or untreated infection
   .
   # Hypoxia: most likely due to volume overload, less likely ? PNA with
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.  ? Empyema contributing.
   - f/u CXR--- CXR yesterday w/ no opacities, small pleural effusions
   - f/u i/o, pt continues to autodiurese
   .
   # AIDS treatment - CD4 count at 1, viral load 30K, currently enrolled
   in a experimental study. Has hx of CMV retinitis, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] esophagitis,
   disseminated Cryptococcus infection and MRSA soft tissue infection.
   - c/w study meds and follow CD4
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear etiology.  drug toxicity vs. cardiorenal syndrome in
   the setting of transient CHF from pericardio-myocarditis. Creatinine
   today is 2.7

   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off further diuresis in him as he appears euvolumic
   - Renal consult if renal function not improving
   .
   # Depressed EF: periwindow TTE.  Most likely due to myopericarditis.
   - repeat TTE
   - currently appears euvolumic post IV lasix

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with advanced AIDS, presenting with worsening sternal chest pain, fevers, and sinus tachycardia. He was found to have a rapidly advancing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and was treated with a window on [**2113-9-1**]. He is currently being managed in the ICU with a diagnosis of pericarditis, possible myocarditis, and pulmonary nodules.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* CD4 count of 1
* Viral load of 30,000
* Creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL
* Blood cultures and pericardial fluid cultures are negative
* AFB cultures are negative
* Lactic acid is 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin is 2.8 g/dL
* LDH is 167 IU/L
* Ca++ is 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++ is 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4 is 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* CMV retinitis
* Disseminated Cryptococcus infection
* MRSA soft tissue infection
* AIDS treatment, including an experimental study
* Previous hospitalization for pericarditis

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Doxycycline
* Fluconazole
* Azithromycin
* Study medications

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis from the pericardial effusion or possible myocarditis
* Cardiac tamponade from the pericardial effusion
* Pulmonary embolism from the pulmonary nodules
* Renal failure from the elevated creatinine levels
* Respiratory failure from the possible pulmonary infiltrates
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from the possible esophagitis
* Neurological complications from the possible CMV retinitis

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and fluconazole
* Renally adjusting vancomycin dose
* Following up with ID recs
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and cardiac tamponade
* Repeating TTE to monitor for depressed EF
* Holding off further diuresis until renal function improves
* Renal consult if renal function does not improve
* Following up with outpatient appointments for pulmonary nodules and possible Kaposi's sarcoma
* Monitoring for signs of active bleeding and possible gastrointestinal bleeding
* Adjusting medications to avoid nephrotoxicity."
