   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following

   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

   Disposition:  Remain in the ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU after an overdose and seizure. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a Charlson comorbidity index score of 4 (hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and depression). The patient has been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 24.8 K/uL
* Hct: 35.5%
* Plt: 256
* Cr: 2.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.08 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 3.8 mmol/L
* Ca++: 6.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Norepinephrine: 0.23 mcg/kg/min
* Midazolam (Versed): 10 mg/hour
* Dopamine: 1.5 mcg/kg/min
* Cisatracurium: 0.06 mg/kg/hour
* Fentanyl: 300 mcg/hour
* Phenylephrine: 1.7 mcg/kg/min
* Insulin: regular, discontinued yesterday
* Dextrose 50%: given 01:36 AM today

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Holding metformin and levothyroxine due to recent ingestion
* Continuing to wean sedation and paralytics
* Restarting CVVH today
* Trending ABG and restarting bicarbonate drip if necessary
* Holding off on antibiotics for now, but starting empirically if patient spikes a temperature
* Following sputum cultures and bronchoscoping today
* Continuing to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempting to wean as tolerated

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac failure due to overdose and metabolic acidosis
* Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis and shunt physiology
* Infection due to leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and lactic acidosis
* Bleeding due to elevated PTT and heparin exposure
* Further complications from overdose and seizure, such as CNS infection or injury

I will continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   1. Overdose
   Known ingestions include metformin and levothyroxine as well as unknown
   depressants. Concern for possible TCA o/d.
   - will attempt to contact outside treaters and obtain accurate med list
   - serial ABG and EKGs
   - bicarb drip
   - LFTs WNL, no evidence for tylenol intake holding on NAC
   - follow up toxicology recommendations
   - psychiatric and social work consults. needs 1:1 when awake.
   .
   2. Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to overdose, potentially TCA. Not bradycardic to
   suggest beta blocker overdose, no history of CCB use. Infection seems
   less likely - could have SIRS however following aspiration. Does not
   appear to be volume depleted at this point. Patient does have history
   of depressed EF (uncertain cause based on available records) but think
   cardiogenic shock less likely.
   - TTE
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Continue neo/levophed
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   3. h/o aspiration
   Patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal.
   Probably has an aspiration pneumonitis
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now
   - Bronch when stabilized, check sputum
   .
   4. Hypoxia
   Possible evolving ARDS in setting of aspiration
   - Increase PEEP
   .
   4. h/o seizure
   ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   5. Acidosis
   He has evidence for a gap and non gap (hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis). Metabolic acidosis present in the setting of elevated
   lactate, potentially metformin related but would also consider
   infection. DKA less likely. Nongap acidosis probably secondary to NS
   resuscitation.
   - bicarbonate drip as above
   - serial ABGs
   - renal recommendations appreciated ?CVVH
   - Titrate up sedation for better synchroncy with vent, incr RR
   .
   6. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to stress response / post seizure, but in setting
   of lactic acidosis also need to rule out infection.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, check sputum
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   7. Acute renal failure
   Baseline Cr uncertain. BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - renal re ?CVVH
   .
   8. Elevated PTT
   In setting of normal INR - ?heparin exposure, consider lupus
   anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - type and screen
   .
   9. Anemia
   Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   10. Diabetes mellitus
   - Hold metformin
   - Insulin drip target <150
   .
   11. Hypothyroidism
   - hold levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   12. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   1. Overdose
   Known ingestions include metformin and levothyroxine as well as unknown
   depressants. Concern for possible TCA o/d.
   - will attempt to contact outside treaters and obtain accurate med list
   - serial ABG and EKGs
   - bicarb drip
   - LFTs WNL, no evidence for tylenol intake holding on NAC
   - follow up toxicology recommendations
   - psychiatric and social work consults. needs 1:1 when awake.
   .
   2. Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to overdose, potentially TCA. Not bradycardic to
   suggest beta blocker overdose, no history of CCB use. Infection seems
   less likely - could have SIRS however following aspiration. Does not
   appear to be volume depleted at this point. Patient does have history
   of depressed EF (uncertain cause based on available records) but think
   cardiogenic shock less likely.
   - TTE
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Continue neo/levophed
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   3. h/o aspiration
   Patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal.
   Probably has an aspiration pneumonitis
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now
   - Bronch when stabilized, check sputum
   .
   4. Hypoxia
   Possible evolving ARDS in setting of aspiration
   - Increase PEEP
   .
   4. h/o seizure
   ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   5. Acidosis
   He has evidence for a gap and non gap (hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis). Metabolic acidosis present in the setting of elevated
   lactate, potentially metformin related but would also consider
   infection. DKA less likely. Nongap acidosis probably secondary to NS
   resuscitation.
   - bicarbonate drip as above
   - serial ABGs
   - renal recommendations appreciated ?CVVH
   - Titrate up sedation for better synchroncy with vent, incr RR
   .
   6. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to stress response / post seizure, but in setting
   of lactic acidosis also need to rule out infection.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, check sputum
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   7. Acute renal failure
   Baseline Cr uncertain. BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - renal re ?CVVH
   .
   8. Elevated PTT
   In setting of normal INR - ?heparin exposure, consider lupus
   anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - type and screen
   .
   9. Anemia
   Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   10. Diabetes mellitus
   - Hold metformin
   - Insulin drip target <150
   .
   11. Hypothyroidism
   - hold levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   12. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   2). Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on levophed only.  Will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   - Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. Urine output improving after CVVH.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   2). Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on levophed only.  Will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   - Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. Urine output improving after CVVH.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF as needed for BP

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient, a 54-year-old man, remains intubated and sedated after an overdose of Metformin and possibly a Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) with a seizure.
* He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, and shunt physiology.
* The patient's hypotension is attributed to the overdose and metabolic acidosis, and he is currently on levophed.
* The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to lactic acidosis, with a worsening creatinine level.
* He also has anemia, hypothyroidism, and leukocytosis, which may be secondary to stress response or post-seizure.
* The patient's electrolytes are unstable, with worsening calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.
* He is being treated with CVVH, and his urine output is improving.
* The patient's blood pressure is being managed with IV fluids and pressors as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of acute renal failure, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for dialysis.
* Development of sepsis or infection, given the patient's leukocytosis and potential aspiration pneumonitis.
* Further instability in blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiac complications.
* Worsening of hypothyroidism, potentially affecting the patient's overall metabolic state.
* Potential for respiratory failure or further hypoxia, given the patient's ongoing respiratory support.
* Development of further electrolyte imbalances, potentially affecting cardiac and neurological function.
* Potential need for further interventions, such as CVVH or dialysis, to manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances and acute renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man who presented to the ICU after an overdose and seizure. He has a history of depression, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. He is intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate of 24, and FiO2 of 40%. His heart rate is 40 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 130/51 mmHg. His central venous pressure is 16 mmHg, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 67%. He has acute kidney injury, lactic acidosis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is also experiencing leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated PTT.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acidosis may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's witnessed aspiration may have caused an aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acidosis may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury may cause electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to myxedema coma and death.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) and death.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient's lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury may cause hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle cramps, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old man, was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a suspected Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB), which led to seizure and intubation. He has been improving clinically, but still requires mechanical ventilation and sedation. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonitis, acute renal failure, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if his aspiration pneumonitis is not effectively managed, or if he develops further lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if his urine output decreases or if he develops further kidney damage.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension may worsen if his blood pressure decreases further, which could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may recur if his lactic acid levels increase or if he develops further metabolic disturbances.
6. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may worsen if he develops further blood loss or if his bone marrow function is impaired.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if his thyroid function is not effectively managed, which could lead to further metabolic and cardiovascular instability.

Based on the patient's ongoing medical issues and potential complications, it is essential to continue to monitor his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status closely, as well as to manage his sedation, pain, and electrolyte levels effectively. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies and microbiological cultures, may be necessary to guide management and rule out potential underlying infections or other medical conditions."

Summary:

The patient is a 75-inch tall individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been off pressors for 24 hours and do not require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) at this time. The patient requires sedation to keep them intubated. They have a history of allergies and are receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and others.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg. Their respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation with CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 650 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 592 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show normal to mildly elevated values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies show more opaque lungs with decreased aeration on chest X-ray.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they require ongoing mechanical ventilation and sedation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if their ventilation settings are not adjusted properly or if they develop a respiratory infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and potentially infected catheter tip and blood culture may indicate sepsis. This could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and poor outcomes if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to their immobility and potential underlying medical conditions. This could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications if not prevented or treated promptly.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's elevated cortisol levels and potential underlying medical conditions may increase their risk for stress ulcer. This could lead to bleeding and other complications if not managed appropriately.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia if evidence of infection
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Extubation trial today
   2). Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   4 Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   5 Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia if evidence of infection
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Extubation trial today
   2). Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   4 Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   5 Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a suspected Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). He had a seizure and was intubated. The patient is currently off pressors, with stable vital signs, and is improving clinically. He has a history of depression and is being treated with sedation to keep him intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia is not fully explained and may be due to shunt physiology. He is at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, and may require further respiratory support.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has already had an episode of aspiration following charcoal administration, and is at risk of developing further aspiration pneumonitis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but he is at risk of developing further acidosis if his kidney function worsens.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and his kidney function is improving, but he is at risk of developing further kidney damage if his blood pressure is not well-controlled.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to stress response and post-seizure, but may also be a sign of infection. He is at risk of developing further infection if his white blood cell count does not decrease.
6. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, and his baseline hemoglobin level is unknown. He is at risk of developing further anemia if his hemoglobin level does not increase.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and his thyroid hormone levels are being monitored. He is at risk of developing further hypothyroidism if his thyroid hormone levels do not normalize.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with sedation. He is at risk of developing further psychiatric complications if his sedation is not well-managed.
9. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged bed rest and intubation.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing a range of medical complications, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates

   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts

   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man who presented with an overdose of Metformin and?CCB with seizure. He remains intubated but continues to improve clinically. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant hypoxia, which is not fully explained by aspiration pneumonitis or shunt physiology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this complication.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline Cr uncertain but is currently improving with good urine output. Renal function should be closely monitored, and electrolytes should be repleted as needed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure decreases during sleep and rises easily on waking. Fluid boluses may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Elevated Lipase: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, and he is at risk for pancreatic complications. Further monitoring and treatment may be necessary.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but it is essential to follow toxicology recommendations and monitor for any signs of recurrence.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to stress response or post-seizure, but it is essential to rule out infection.
7. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being treated, but it is essential to monitor for any signs of recurrence.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure can progress to respiratory arrest if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease if not properly managed.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels can lead to pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis can lead to infection, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia can lead to complications such as cardiovascular instability or bleeding if not properly managed.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can lead to complications such as cardiovascular instability, cognitive impairment, or infertility if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   FEN: TF today, IVF as needed for BP
   Access: R HD line, will attempt further access today

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man who presented with a history of depression and suicidal attempts. He was found unresponsive and intubated, with a possible overdose of Metformin and Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). He had a seizure and was intubated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is:

* Intubated and mechanically ventilated
* Hypoxic respiratory failure with shunt physiology
* Afebrile with decreasing WBC count
* Diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR
* Acute renal failure with improving urine output
* Hypotension, but no longer requiring pressor support
* Elevated lipase levels, with possible pancreatitis
* Metabolic acidosis, which has resolved
* Leukocytosis, possibly secondary to stress response or post-seizure
* Anemia, possibly related to renal failure or hemolysis
* Hypothyroidism, with holding of levothyroxine

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure can progress, leading to worsening kidney function and potential need for dialysis.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels can indicate pancreatitis, which can worsen and lead to complications such as abscesses, pleural effusions, or sepsis.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lipase levels can indicate an underlying infection, which can worsen and lead to sepsis or organ failure.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypotension and metabolic acidosis can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen and lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypothyroidism and metabolic acidosis can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning from sedation and attempting to extubate
* Monitoring of respiratory function and adjusting ventilator settings as needed
* Management of acute renal failure, including fluid management and electrolyte repletion
* Monitoring of lipase levels and pancreatitis
* Trending of WBC count and monitoring for signs of infection
* Electrolyte repletion and monitoring for cardiac complications
* Repletion of thyroid hormones once the patient is stable

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the plan of care as needed to prevent potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health status remains critical in the ICU. Notably, the patient did not tolerate weaning sedation, and psychiatric medications were not restarted due to psych recommendation. The patient experienced episodes of apnea on PSV, which led to switching to CMV mode, resulting in better tolerance with less agitation and hypertension.

Physiological parameters:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.3°C, Tcurrent 37.2°C, HR 58 bpm, BP 112/54 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: No significant changes.
* Fluid balance: Total input 861 mL, total output 3,610 mL, resulting in a balance of -2,749 mL.

Laboratory results:

* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 195 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 157 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

Medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with a RSBI of 86 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 226. This may indicate the need for further respiratory support.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 157 mg/dL, which may indicate hypoglycemia. Monitoring of glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy as necessary is crucial.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's TCO2 level is 26, indicating metabolic acidosis. This may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 58 bpm, which may indicate bradycardia. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and potential interventions as necessary are necessary.
6. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 195 K/uL, which may indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Further evaluation and potential adjustments to anticoagulation therapy are necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's WBC count is 13.7 K/uL, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation and potential antibiotics as necessary are necessary.

In summary, the patient remains critically ill in the ICU, with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and potential interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) with seizure. He remains intubated but is clinically improving.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 226 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is 112/54 mmHg, and he is no longer requiring pressor support. His heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia with a rate of 58 beats per minute.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, but his baseline creatinine level is uncertain. He is currently producing good urine output, and his electrolyte levels are being repleted as needed.
* Metabolic status: The patient has resolved metabolic acidosis, but he will require repeat continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) as needed.
* Hematological status: The patient has mild anemia, and his white blood cell count is trending down. He is at risk for infection, and further antibiotics will be held off unless there is evidence of fever or other signs of infection.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and able to open his eyes and follow commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires close monitoring to ensure that his oxygenation and ventilation needs are met.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
* Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised, and he is at risk for developing sepsis or other infections.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is suppressed due to the recent ingestion of Metformin, and he may require thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he is at risk for developing leukopenia or other hematological complications.
* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slow, and he is at risk for developing bradycardia or other cardiac arrhythmias.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and ensure his recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - LENI for questionable PE on CXR per radiology
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but rapidly improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus: Patient nauseated/vomiting today without bowel movement
   -          KUB to evaluate for bowel loops/free air
   -          Aggressive bowel regiment
   # Hypertension:  Paitent
s BP 150s
   -          Wean Nitrodrip
   -          Amlodipine 5mg when tolerating PO
   # Elevated lipase:
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - Restart Levothyroxine 50mcg IV now to 112mcg PO when tolerating PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and possibly a calcium channel blocker, resulting in seizure. He remains intubated but is clinically improving.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains at risk for respiratory failure due to his history of overdose and seizure, which can lead to respiratory depression.
2. Psychiatric Complications: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and is at risk for psychiatric complications such as agitation, aggression, and suicidal ideation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is uncertain, but his renal function is rapidly improving with good urine output. However, he is at risk for acute kidney injury or further deterioration of his renal function.
4. Ileus: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, and has not had a bowel movement. This can lead to bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, or other complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he is at risk for further hypertension-related complications such as cardiovascular events, stroke, or kidney damage.
6. Elevated Lipase: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, which can indicate pancreatitis or other pancreatic complications.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but he is at risk for further acid-base imbalances if his kidney function deteriorates or if he develops other complications.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to stress response or post-seizure, but it is also possible that it may be related to infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause of his leukocytosis.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to renal failure or hemolysis, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being treated with Levothyroxine, but he is at risk for further complications if his thyroid function is not properly managed.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male who was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday, but reintubated due to respiratory distress. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation and is being weaned off sedatives. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 181/72 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on 100% FiO2. He has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is still elevated despite treatment with nitroglycerin.

The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, and his abdominal examination is significant for diffuse tenderness. His lung examination reveals decreased breath sounds and wheezes on the right side. His neurologic examination is significant for a slow response and an odd, childlike affect.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His liver function tests are slightly elevated, and his kidney function tests are within normal limits. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting, as well as his abdominal tenderness, suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's elevated blood pressure and history of hypertension suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's slow response and childlike affect suggest the possibility of neurologic complications, such as stroke or encephalitis.
7. Infection: The patient's history of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean the patient off sedatives as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Consider antibiotics for sepsis or pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider cardiovascular instability.
6. Monitor the patient's neurologic status closely and consider neurologic complications.
7. Consider imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate the patient's brain and lungs."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus:
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:

 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2176-1-27**] 05:15 PM
   -Sedated using Haldol 5 mg TID and propafol as needed, in attempt to
   wean fent/midaz-needs daily EKG, per psych decrease haldol to 2.5 TID
   with increased PRN.
   -Follow HCT-bump to 30.6
   -Extubated, remained hypertensive given haldol and ativan-pressures,
   still elevated, started on Nitro drip titrated to pressure <150
   -Per nurse: Desaturated with face shovel to low 90s, placed on face
   mask and did not increase so added nasal cannula.  Saturations improved
   while sleeping, and worsened while awake.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after an overdose of Metformin and?CCB with seizure. He remains intubated but continues to improve clinically.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated but is tolerating a face mask.
2. Psychiatric condition: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and is currently receiving Haldol to manage his symptoms.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is uncertain, but his current creatinine level is improving with good urine output.
4. Ileus: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain and has a history of constipation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he has a history of hypotension.
6. Elevated Lipase: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, and he is experiencing abdominal pain.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but he is still experiencing some symptoms.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be secondary to stress response or post-seizure.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to renal failure or hemolysis.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated for hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could worsen if he is not properly ventilated.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of depression make him more susceptible to infection.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if his creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Ileus: The patient's ileus could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.

To manage these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and treatment. This may include:

1. Respiratory therapy: The patient will require close monitoring and treatment to manage his respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotics: The patient may require antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
3. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require renal replacement therapy if his creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Ileus treatment: The patient may require treatment for his ileus, such as nasogastric suction or antibiotics.
5. Hypotension treatment: The patient may require treatment for his hypotension, such as fluid boluses or vasopressors.
6. Metabolic acidosis treatment: The patient may require treatment for his metabolic acidosis, such as bicarbonate therapy or dialysis.
7. Leukocytosis treatment: The patient may require treatment for his leukocytosis, such as antibiotics or corticosteroids.
8. Anemia treatment: The patient may require treatment for his anemia, such as blood transfusions or iron supplements.
9. Hypothyroidism treatment: The patient may require treatment for his hypothyroidism, such as thyroid hormone replacement therapy."
