   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE, ?any underlying obstructive disease.  Pulmonary
   following on the floor.  Had reached stable point with worsening O2
   requirements over past 8-12 hours.  New fever at same time.  Likely
   some tachypnea a result of fever.  Also concern for pneumonia (HAP)
   given increasing and change in sputum and cough, fever, slight
   worsening of WBC count.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be volume overloaded with poor
   response to most recent 80 mg IV lasix dose and longstanding volume
   overload, despite meeting I/O goals on floor. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt.  Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Check BNP for comparisons to priors.
   - likely with replace Aline for hemodynamic monitoring on gtt plus
   access to frequent ABGs given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Vanc, Zosyn Cipro
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check abd US given surgery; unable to do CT abd currently given
   respiratory status/inability to lie flat, but would consider this in
   future.
   - restart vanc for GPC coverage, start double gram negative with cipro
   and ?zosyn vs. meropenem.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil and anticoag for now.  Consideration for increase
   in sildenafil vs. endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - RHC in the future.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue therapeutic lovenox.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE.  Chronically anticoagulated.  Was also on plavix at some
   point with report of ?breakthrough clot on coumadin.  Reports
   hemoptysis on plavix.  Now on ASA plus lovenox. However with worsening
   renal function would consider hold
   - Continuing lovenox, holding coumadin as above.  Ideal anticoagulant
   for long term - lovenox or coumadin given ?coumadin failure.  Consider
   check factor X levels to ensure lovenox thereapeutic, though not
   morbidly obese and with normal renal function so would guess levels as
   expected.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Daily dressing changes.
   - wound care
   - pain control.
   - abdominal US to check for collections; consider CT abdomen.
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO until respiratory status
   improves, then regular DM/low Na
   # Prophylaxis: therapeutic lovenox.
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE, ?any underlying obstructive disease.  Pulmonary
   following on the floor.  Had reached stable point with worsening O2
   requirements over past 8-12 hours.  New fever at same time.  Likely
   some tachypnea a result of fever.  Also concern for pneumonia (HAP)
   given increasing and change in sputum and cough, fever, slight
   worsening of WBC count.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be volume overloaded with poor
   response to most recent 80 mg IV lasix dose and longstanding volume
   overload, despite meeting I/O goals on floor. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt.  Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Check BNP for comparisons to priors.
   - likely with replace Aline for hemodynamic monitoring on gtt plus
   access to frequent ABGs given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Vanc, Zosyn Cipro
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check abd US given surgery; unable to do CT abd currently given
   respiratory status/inability to lie flat, but would consider this in
   future.
   - restart vanc for GPC coverage, start double gram negative with cipro
   and ?zosyn vs. meropenem.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil and anticoag for now.  Consideration for increase
   in sildenafil vs. endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - RHC in the future.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue therapeutic lovenox.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE.  Chronically anticoagulated.  Was also on plavix at some
   point with report of ?breakthrough clot on coumadin.  Reports
   hemoptysis on plavix.  Now on ASA plus lovenox. However with worsening
   renal function would consider hold
   - Continuing lovenox, holding coumadin as above.  Ideal anticoagulant
   for long term - lovenox or coumadin given ?coumadin failure.  Consider
   check factor X levels to ensure lovenox thereapeutic, though not
   morbidly obese and with normal renal function so would guess levels as
   expected.

   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and is now readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has poor baseline respiratory status due to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE. He is at risk for worsening respiratory failure, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever, cough, and increasing white blood cell count, which may indicate pneumonia. He is at risk for developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Volume overload: The patient has a history of volume overload and has not responded well to diuretic therapy. He is at risk for developing congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has worsening renal function, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy for his pulmonary hypertension and PFO closure, which increases his risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a history of chronic PE and is at risk for developing thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of HAP and is at risk for developing other infectious complications, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs).

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy and is being monitored for respiratory distress.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected HAP and is being monitored for signs of infection.
3. Diuretic therapy: The patient is receiving diuretic therapy to manage his volume overload and congestive heart failure.
4. Anticoagulant therapy: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy to manage his pulmonary hypertension and PFO closure.
5. Renal function monitoring: The patient's renal function is being closely monitored to ensure that he does not develop AKI or CKD.
6. Bleeding risk assessment: The patient's bleeding risk is being closely monitored to ensure that he does not develop bleeding complications.
7. Infection control measures: The patient is receiving infection control measures, such as daily dressing changes and wound care, to prevent the development of surgical site infections.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and improve his clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient improved today. On 6L nasal
   cannula. Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably
   related to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology
   unclear which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible
   given fever, recent cessation in antibiotics, however no white count,
   has not continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor
   response to 80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP
   elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix gtt.  Goal -500cc. Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Supratherapeutic INR currently. Hold Lovenox given worsening renal
   function. Monitor INR.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Surgery consult re: Abdominal Fluid Collection.
   - Vanc, Zosyn
 hold Cipro given elevated INR and QT prolongation.
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Hold Ciprofloxacin
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil. Supratherapeutic INR. Holding other
   anticoagulation for now. Consideration for increase in sildenafil vs.
   endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - Swan Catheter for eval of right heart function.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Hold lovenox currently supratherapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR.
   - Restart Coumadin sp RHC.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Health Status:**

* The patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure.
* He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and is now readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
* The patient has a poor baseline respiratory status, which is likely related to his underlying pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE.
* He has a history of atrial flutter, which was cardioverted at an outside hospital, and is currently anticoagulated.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Distress:** The patient's respiratory status is poor, and he is at risk for further deterioration due to his underlying pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a fever, and the etiology of his respiratory distress is unclear. Pneumonia is a possible diagnosis, given the recent cessation of antibiotics and the absence of a white blood cell count spike.
3. **Fluid Overload:** The patient has a history of fluid overload, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress. His blood pressure is slightly elevated, and his urine output is decreased.
4. **New Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient's respiratory distress may be related to a new pulmonary embolism, which would be a life-threatening complication.
5. **Infection:** The patient has a fever and abdominal fluid collections, which may indicate an underlying infection. The etiology of the infection is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.
6. **Prolonged QT Interval:** The patient's prolonged QT interval is likely secondary to his recent use of ciprofloxacin and may be contributing to his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. **Thrombocytosis:** The patient has a thrombocytosis, which may be related to his acute infection and postoperative state.
8. **Type II Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, which may be contributing to his hyperglycemia.
9. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** The patient has a history of GERD, which may be contributing to his respiratory symptoms.

**Treatment Plan:**

* Continue lasix gtt to manage fluid overload and respiratory distress.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
* Hold ciprofloxacin due to the prolonged QT interval.
* Consideration for RHC and further PA hypertension management.
* Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
* Monitor the patient's INR and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
* Consideration for surgery to manage abdominal fluid collections.
* Continue antibiotics for HAP, and consider induction therapy if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytosis and adjust his platelet count as necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, diastolic heart failure, and PFO closure. He was initially admitted to the operating room for a strangulated hernia and then readmitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and fever, and has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and oxygen therapy. He has also been experiencing abdominal pain and has had an ultrasound of the abdomen that showed complex paramedian fluid collections, which may be infected.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, he is at high risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's poor response to diuretics and fluid overload may lead to further complications, including heart failure and respiratory distress.
3. New Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's history of chronic pulmonary embolism, it is possible that he may have developed a new pulmonary embolism, which could worsen his respiratory status.
4. Abdominal Infection: The patient's abdominal fluid collections may be infected, which could lead to further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
5. Prolonged QT Interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval may increase his risk of developing arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.
6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis may increase his risk of developing bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's history of type II diabetes and his current condition may increase his risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to receive antibiotics, diuretics, and oxygen therapy to manage his respiratory distress and infection. He will also undergo further evaluation, including a Swan-Ganz catheter to assess his right heart function and a repeat EKG to monitor his QT interval. The patient's anticoagulation therapy will be adjusted based on his INR levels and his risk of bleeding. He will also receive close monitoring of his respiratory status and will be treated with mechanical ventilation if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures

   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.
   - Desaturated to 83% while sleeping last night. Was fine when woken.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 41-year-old male, is being treated for severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and PFO closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and later readmitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 61 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which was cardioverted at an outside hospital. He is currently anticoagulated.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 27.3%
* Platelet count: 91 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 33 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* C-reactive protein (CRP): elevated

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory distress
* Hypoxia
* Fever
* Atrial flutter
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Diastolic heart failure
* Chronic PE
* Thrombocytosis
* Type II DM
* GERD

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
* Lasix for fluid overload
* Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension
* Heparin for atrial flutter and chronic PE
* Warfarin for atrial flutter
* Pain control for post-operative pain
* Sliding scale insulin for glycemic control
* Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GERD
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Worsening pulmonary hypertension
* Chronic PE
* Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR)
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypoxia
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac failure
* Renal failure
* Sepsis
* Infection
* Metabolic alkalosis
* Electrolyte imbalance

The patient's current condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and ensure optimal treatment."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.
   - Desaturated to 83% while sleeping last night. Was fine when woken.

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight. Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear which led to decompensation on
   the floor. Pneumonia possible given fever, recent cessation of
   antibiotics, however no white count, has not continued to spike. Fluid
   overload also possible given poor response to 80mg IV lasix on the
   floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Consider restart lovenox/heparin/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abdominal
   ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery has seen
   patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.  Influenza DFA
   negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn; hold cipro given elevated INR and QT
   prolongation (vancomycin re- ordered)
   - Continue hold ciprofloxacin as no source
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider hold lovenox; bridge with heparin pending decisions about
   right heart cath
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss regarding RHC
   - Given worsening renal function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above
   - Swan catheter for eval of right heart function
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Consider restart lovenox/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC)
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Restart coumadin s/p RHC
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Consider restart lovenox/heparin/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abdominal
   ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery has seen
   patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.  Influenza DFA
   negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn; hold cipro given elevated INR and QT
   prolongation (vancomycin re- ordered)
   - Continue hold ciprofloxacin as no source
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Consider start lasix IV bid 40mg; goal -500mL to -1L
   - Consider hold lovenox; bridge with heparin pending decisions about
   right heart cath
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss regarding RHC
   - Given worsening renal function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above
   - Swan catheter for eval of right heart function
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Consider restart lovenox/coumadin given therapeutic INR
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC)
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Restart coumadin s/p RHC
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, atrial flutter, and chronic pulmonary embolism (CTEPHTN) who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension. He has been on high-flow oxygen therapy and has been responding to diuresis. His creatinine level has increased, and he will be switched to a lower dose of Lasix. His heparin therapy will be restarted when his international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 2. He is also being treated for atrial flutter with sotalol, and his vanc/zosyn antibiotics will be continued for 8 days.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he is still requiring high-flow oxygen therapy. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is a significant concern, and there is a risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension leading to right ventricular failure.
3. Chronic pulmonary embolism: The patient's chronic pulmonary embolism (CTEPHTN) is a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure. There is a risk of further pulmonary embolism or worsening of existing emboli.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias, and there is a risk of further arrhythmias or worsening of existing arrhythmias.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's increased creatinine level is a concern, and there is a risk of further worsening of renal function.
6. Infection: The patient's antibiotic therapy may not be adequate to treat his underlying infection, and there is a risk of further infection or sepsis.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, and there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory status, cardiac function, and renal function. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, or cardiac arrhythmias. His antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary, and his anticoagulation therapy should be closely monitored to minimize the risk of bleeding. His nutritional status should be assessed and addressed as necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular DM/low Na; NPO for
   possible procedure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted to the operating room (OSH) for a strangulated hernia and then readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He has a history of recurrent episodes of desaturation and has been treated with antibiotics, lasix, and vanc.

Current status:

* Bradycardic with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute (IPM)
* Oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nebulizer
* Fever-free, but with a history of recent antibiotic use
* Abdominal ultrasound shows complex paramedian fluid collections, but surgery has ruled out infection
* Blood cultures are pending
* CXR shows areas of increased opacification at both bases, possibly representing atelectasis or bilateral pneumonia
* Pulmonary hypertension is worsening, with a possible component of preload secondary to reduced volume
* Atrial flutter is present, with a history of cardioversion at an outside hospital
* Prolonged QT interval is present, possibly secondary to ciprofloxacin or sotalol
* Thrombocytosis is present, likely related to acute infection and post-operative state

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia, possibly bilateral, given the patient's history of recurrent episodes of desaturation and recent cessation of antibiotics
* Fluid overload, given the patient's poor response to lasix and history of diastolic heart failure
* New pulmonary embolism, given the patient's history of recurrent episodes of desaturation and worsening pulmonary hypertension
* Metabolic alkalosis, given the patient's history of chronic PE and possible component of preload secondary to reduced volume
* Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, given the patient's history of recurrent episodes of desaturation and worsening pulmonary hypertension
* Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, given the patient's history of worsening pulmonary hypertension and possible component of preload secondary to reduced volume
* Diastolic heart failure, given the patient's history of recurrent episodes of desaturation and worsening pulmonary hypertension

Plan:

* Continue high-flow oxygen support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension
* Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow
* Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending RHC/procedures
* Continue sildenafil
* Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
* Reassess UOP and consider re-starting lasix
* Continue vanc/zosyn and follow vancomycin trough
* Follow blood cultures and consider induction if unable to produce sputum
* Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea persists
* Discontinue lasix gtt and reassess UOP
* Continue daily dressing changes, wound care, and pain control prn
* Appreciate surgery recommendations and continue to monitor for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. The patient was initially admitted to the operating room (OSH) for strangulated hernia repair, but was readmitted to the ICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 52 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and occasional wheezing in both lungs, as well as a surgical midline incision with serosanguinous drainage.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 571 x 10^9/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 27.9 mmol/L, and his creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of poor baseline respiratory status, and his current symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress may be related to pneumonia, fluid overload, or new PE.
2. Fever: The patient has a history of fever, and his current temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F).
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and his current EKG shows a prolonged QT interval.
4. Prolonged QT: The patient's QT interval is 438 ms, which may be related to his recent use of ciprofloxacin and sotalol.
5. Chronic PE: The patient has a history of chronic PE, and his current INR is supratherapeutic.
6. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a platelet count of 571 x 10^9/L, which may be related to his acute infection and post-operative state.
7. Type II DM: The patient has a diagnosis of type II DM, and his current glucose level is 150 mg/dL.
8. GERD: The patient has a diagnosis of GERD, and his current PPI medication is being continued.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and zosyn for suspected HAP, and his blood cultures are pending.
2. Lasix: The patient is receiving lasix 20mg IV BID for fluid overload, and his urine output is being monitored.
3. Oxygen therapy: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Sildenafil: The patient is receiving sildenafil to treat his pulmonary hypertension.
5. Heparin: The patient is being started on heparin when his INR is less than 2, pending RHC and procedures.
6. Pain control: The patient is receiving pain control medication as needed for his surgical incision.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress may be related to pneumonia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may be related to his lasix medication and possible component preload secondary to reduced volume.
3. New PE: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress may be related to a new PE.
4. Chronic PE: The patient's chronic PE may be related to his history of PE and PFO closure.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may be related to his history of atrial flutter and PFO closure.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and he will need to be discussed with case management regarding pulmonary rehabilitation."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episodes of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for a total of eight days
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Follow sputum culture; consider induction given concern for
   recurrence if can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Stable to mild improvement. Likely initially related with lasix
   gtt, possible preload component [**2-4**] volume.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Anemia. Hct slightly decreasing. Uncertain anemia chronic disease
   versus other etiologies.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted to the hospital for a strangulated hernia and was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient has poor baseline respiratory status due to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE. Etiology of the current decompensation is unclear, but pneumonia, fluid overload, and new PE are possible causes.
* Fever: The patient has a history of fever, which is currently controlled. He has received a recent 8-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is stable to mild improving, likely related to initial lasix gtt and possible preload component.
* Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has class IV symptoms and is currently on sildenafil. His mPAPs are elevated, and the differential includes chronic thromboembolic disease, L-to-R shunting from PFO, idiopathic PAH, and diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which was cardioverted at an outside hospital. He currently has an episode of repeat atrial flutter with right ventricular overload (RVR) when sotalol was decreased.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is slightly decreasing, and the etiology is uncertain.
* Prolonged QT: The patient has a prolonged QT interval, likely secondary to ciprofloxacin and possibly sotalol.
* Chronic PE: The patient has supratherapeutic INR and will hold lovenox due to worsening renal function.
* Thrombocytosis: The patient's platelet count is stable to improving, likely related to acute infection and post-op.
* Type II DM: The patient's blood sugar is under control with a sliding scale.
* GERD: The patient is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's fever and respiratory distress could be signs of pneumonia, which is a possible cause of his current decompensation.
* Fluid overload: The patient's poor response to lasix and elevated BNP suggest that fluid overload may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
* New PE: The patient's history of PE and elevated mPAPs make it possible that he has developed a new PE.
* Atrial flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter and current episode with RVR may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
* ARF: The patient's ARF is stable to mild improving, but further complications may arise if his kidney function does not improve.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement and may be considered for transfer to the floor later in the day, but this is dependent on securing insurance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy, and peripheral edema. He has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute strangulated hernia. He has undergone a hernia repair and cardioversion, and is currently on diuretics and oxygen therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 51 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/68 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for normal breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and no acute distress. His extremities show no signs of edema. His skin is warm, and his neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's plan of care includes continued diuretic therapy, antibiotics, and anticoagulation with Coumadin. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable at present, but he may require continued oxygen therapy and monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of chronic pulmonary emboli and is at risk for further episodes.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase his risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulation therapy.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced due to diuretic therapy or other medications, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
5. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for his respiratory infection, but may be at risk for further infections, particularly if his immune system is compromised.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial flutter and may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable at present, but he requires continued close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."
