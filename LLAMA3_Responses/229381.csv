   Assessment and Plan  Assessment and Plan: 42F with SLE with
   cryoglobulinemia vasculitis CAD s/p MI and stenting (EF 20%) ICD,
   presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis,
   PNA, osteomyeltis), Metabolic (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroid, hypernatremia), Medication induced
   (opiates, withdrawl), Structural (although no evidence Normal Pressure
   Hydrocephalus), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis, stroke), Seizure (pt with
   prior hx). Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital1 12**] MRI,
   SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis
   remain high in the differential. Other aseptic meningitidies (viral,
   TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the differential).
   - follow neuro exam, still not following commands
   - BCx, UCx, Wound Cx pending
   - Review OSH records
   - f/u results of LP, no suggestion of meningitits at this time
   - Cont empiric coverage for meningitis given immunosuppression
   (Ampicillin/Acyclovir), will d/c vanc/ceftraixone
   - ID consult for ? listeria/aseptic meningitis
   - [**Hospital1 **] and correct electrolyte disturbances
   - TSH high normal
   - if extubated, will place on methadone IV standing and morphine IV PRN
   for home opiate use, diazepam IV vs. ativan standing for home
   benzodiazapine use
   - f/u EEG results -> will ask Neuro consult service for possible 24
   hour EEG monitoring
   - f/u OSH cultures
   - f/u Neuro and Rheum recs, appreciate input -> ? to Rheum re: specific
   diagnosis of SLE cerebritis
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows
   - if extubated, will likely need diuresis
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)-  The patient is on Methadone
   40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient for vasculitis.  See
   above for equivalents to home opiate and benzo use.

   # Tachycardia: ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been 110s up to
   160s when patient appears agitated. Of note the patient appeared to
   bumped troponins from 0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia,
   thus likely stess induced. DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation,
   pain, withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hyperthyroidism, less likely intravascular depletion (unlikely given
   evidence of pulmonary edema).
   - Treat underlying pain issues (details below)
   - Monitor for signs of benzo withdrawl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory alkalosis and mild ketoacidosis, and is currently intubated due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's underlying condition is not properly managed.
2. Heart failure: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is currently experiencing acute systolic heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac complications if the patient's condition is not properly managed.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently on empiric antibiotics for suspected meningitis. There is a risk of sepsis if the patient's underlying infection is not properly treated.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. There is a risk of bleeding if the patient's coagulation status is not properly monitored and managed.
5. Pain management: The patient has a history of chronic pain and is currently on opioids and benzodiazepines. There is a risk of addiction and withdrawal if the patient's pain is not properly managed.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalance and is currently on diuretics. There is a risk of electrolyte imbalance if the patient's diuretic therapy is not properly monitored and managed.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is currently on antibiotics. There is a risk of infection if the patient's underlying condition is not properly treated.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological complications and is currently experiencing altered mental status. There is a risk of further neurological complications if the patient's condition is not properly managed.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal complications and is currently on antacids and proton pump inhibitors. There is a risk of gastrointestinal complications if the patient's underlying condition is not properly managed.
10. Endocrine complications: The patient has a history of endocrine complications and is currently on thyroid hormone replacement therapy. There is a risk of endocrine complications if the patient's thyroid hormone levels are not properly monitored and managed.

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest that they are at high risk for these complications. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage their underlying medical conditions to prevent these complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent myocardial infarction (MI) with stenting. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute pain, and chronic pain.

The patient's medical conditions and medications are as follows:

* SLE with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis
* CAD with recent MI and stenting
* Chronic pain management with methadone and oxycodone
* Long-term management with CellCept and prednisone for SLE
* Current medications: CellCept, methylprednisone, methadone, oxycodone, ranitidine, and ampicillin

The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies are as follows:

* Complete blood count (CBC): WBC 9.9, Hct 34.7, Plt 324
* Electrolyte panel: Na 146, K 3.4, Cl 100, CO2 26
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine: 17 and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively
* Liver function tests (LFTs): ALT 13, AST 20, Alk Phos 93, T Bili 0.5
* Troponin-T: 0.07 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 5.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 271 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.4 mg/dL
* TSH: high normal

Imaging studies:

* Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): LA elongated, LV wall thicknesses normal, LV cavity size top normal/borderline dilated, severe global LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%), moderate mitral regurgitation, and trivial pericardial effusion
* Chest X-ray (CXR): clear

The patient's clinical status is as follows:

* Altered mental status: not following commands, responding to stimuli
* Respiratory failure: acute on chronic, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation
* Acute pain: managed with methadone and oxycodone
* Chronic pain: managed with methadone and oxycodone
* Coagulopathy: INR 3.9, considering vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for correction
* Acute systolic congestive heart failure: clinically evident, managed with diuresis and consideration of beta-blockers
* Foot ulcerations: secondary to underlying vasculitis and Raynaud's phenomenon

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions and treatment include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections or catheter-related bloodstream infections
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and coagulopathy
* Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to underlying CAD and hypertension
* Hepatic dysfunction or liver failure due to underlying SLE and medication use
* Electrolyte imbalances or hypocalcemia due to underlying kidney disease and medication use
* Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to underlying lung disease and invasive mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart block, due to underlying CAD and medication use

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and treatment, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of deterioration or complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows
   - if extubated, will likely need diuresis
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation

   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever, less
   likely intravascular depletion (unlikely given evidence of pulmonary
   edema).

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows
   - if extubated, will likely need diuresis
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation
 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)- complicated by cryoglobulinemia
   vasculitis.  Patient currently on long term management with CellCept,
   Prednisone.  Question if lupus cerebritis could be etiology of altered

   aspirin at home.
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Elevated troponins from
   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hemorrhage.
   - will start beta blockade for rate control
   - will need diuresis post-extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

* The patient is intubated and sedated, with altered mental status.
* The patient has a fever of 102.9°F (39.4°C) and is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 50-60 breaths per minute.
* The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and chronic anemia.
* The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, indicating severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
* The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation and a trivial pericardial effusion.
* The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, and is at risk for hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypopotassemia.
* The patient has a white blood cell count of 9.9 billion cells per liter, indicating a mild leukocytosis.
* The patient has a platelet count of 202 billion cells per liter, indicating thrombocytopenia.
* The patient has a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, indicating mild renal impairment.
* The patient has a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20 mg/dL, indicating mild azotemia.
* The patient has a serum albumin level of 3.4 g/dL, indicating hypoalbuminemia.
* The patient has a total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, indicating mild hyperbilirubinemia.
* The patient has a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 271 IU/L, indicating mild LDH elevation.
* The patient has a calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL, indicating mild hypocalcemia.
* The patient has a magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL, indicating mild hypomagnesemia.
* The patient has a phosphate level of 3.4 mg/dL, indicating mild hypophosphatemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypneic and tachycardic condition may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and left ventricular hypokinesis may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's mild renal impairment and azotemia may worsen, leading to renal failure.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's mild hyperbilirubinemia and LDH elevation may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen and lead to hepatic failure.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia, hypopotassemia, and hypomagnesemia may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalance and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Infection: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and chronic anemia may increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

The patient's ICU care plan should focus on managing their respiratory failure, pain control, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as monitoring for signs of sepsis, cardiac arrest, renal failure, and hepatic failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute respiratory failure, and the differential includes airway, alveolar, and vascular causes. The patient was intubated yesterday for respiratory distress, and a trial of CPAP was attempted this morning.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and acute systolic heart failure is suspected based on the patient's clinical presentation. The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease, and the patient's troponin levels are elevated.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 3.9, which may be secondary to antibiotics. The patient is at risk for bleeding and may require vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct the coagulopathy.
4. Pain Control: The patient is in pain and is receiving IV Dilaudid and Valium. The patient's pain regimen is equivalent to 24 hours of IV Dilaudid, and the patient is at risk for respiratory depression.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and is at risk for sepsis. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the patient's temperature is 102.9°F.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an elevated potassium level and is at risk for hypokalemia.
7. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic anemia, and the patient's hemoglobin level is 8.2 g/dL.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and is at risk for infection. The patient's wound cultures are pending, and the patient's sputum culture is pending.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of stroke and is at risk for neurological complications. The patient's neurological exam is abnormal, and the patient is not following commands.
10. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory alkalosis, and the patient's current gas is suggestive of an acute on chronic process. The patient's bicarbonate level is 20 mmol/L, which is elevated.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Respiratory support with intubation and mechanical ventilation
* Heart failure treatment with diuresis and vasopressors
* Coagulopathy treatment with vitamin K and FFP
* Pain control with IV Dilaudid and Valium
* Sepsis treatment with antibiotics and source control
* Electrolyte imbalance treatment with potassium supplementation
* Anemia treatment with blood transfusions
* Infection treatment with antibiotics
* Neurological complications treatment with anticonvulsants and sedation
* Metabolic alkalosis treatment with bicarbonate supplementation

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. She presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, which was initially thought to be due to sepsis, but subsequent testing revealed no evidence of infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic respiratory alkalosis and may have an acute on chronic process.
* Cardiovascular: Systolic and diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 20%. She has a history of coronary artery disease and is on a beta-blocker.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, which is not due to delirium. She has a history of stroke and cognitive dysfunction.
* Renal: Chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL.
* Hematological: Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL.
* Infectious: No evidence of infection, but the patient is on empiric antibiotics for possible meningitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to further decompensation.
* Neurological decline: The patient's altered mental status may progress, and there is a risk of further neurological decline.
* Infection: Although the patient is on empiric antibiotics, there is still a risk of developing an infection, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
* Pain control: The patient's pain needs to be adequately controlled to prevent further deterioration.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 9.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, platelet count 324 x 10^9/L.
* Electrolytes: Sodium 146 mmol/L, potassium 3.4 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/L, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L.
* Renal function: Creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 27 mg/dL.
* Liver function: Alanine transaminase (ALT) 13 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 20 IU/L.
* Coagulation studies: International normalized ratio (INR) 3.9, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 27.8 seconds.

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Chest X-ray: Clear, with no evidence of pneumonia or other acute processes.
* Echocardiogram: Systolic and diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 20%.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Not available.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Cardiovascular support: Diuresis and vasodilators.
* Neurological support: Sedation and analgesia.
* Infection prophylaxis: Empiric antibiotics and antifungal therapy.
* Bleeding prophylaxis: Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
* Pain control: Narcotics and benzodiazepines.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

   suggestive of a chronic respiratory alkalosis, thus, patients gas on
   admission may be a an acute on chronic process with a mild underlying
   metabolic acidosis (with small gap, trace ketones in urine, normal
   lacate). Differential for underlying alkalosis includes pulmonary
   edema, PE, PNA, anemia, anxiety-hyperventilation, sepsis. Given a
   history of diarrhea, the patient may also have had a component of
   metabolic alkalosis.
   - Treat underlying pulmonary edema as detailed above
   - Consider treating anxiety PRN with low dose benzos PRN
   - Maintain Hct>30 given cardiac history
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ABG
   - Consider V/Q scan given pt with ""allergy"" to IV dye.

   # Tachycardia: ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been 110s up to
   160s when patient appears agitated. Of note the patient appeared to
   bumped troponins from 0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia,
   thus likely stess induced. DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation,
   pain, withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hyperthyroidism, less likely intravascular depletion (unlikely given
   evidence of pulmonary edema).
   - Treat underlying pain issues (details below)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

1. The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of SLE, cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, CAD, and ICD, who presented with altered mental status.
2. She has been intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and has a history of stroke.
3. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, coagulopathy, and electrolyte disturbances.
4. She has a history of chronic respiratory alkalosis, which may be acute on chronic, and is being treated with oxygen therapy.
5. The patient has a tachycardia, which is likely due to agitation, pain, withdrawal, or stress, and is being treated with pain management and rate control.
6. She has a coagulopathy, which is being treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
7. The patient has acute systolic congestive heart failure, which is being treated with diuresis and consideration of beta-blockers.
8. She has pain control issues, which are being managed with IV Dilaudid and adjustment of dose as needed.
9. The patient has a history of foot ulcerations due to underlying vasculitis and Raynaud's disease.
10. She is being treated for SLE with CellCept and Prednisone, and is being followed by rheumatology.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to underlying chronic respiratory disease or pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to immunosuppression and potential bacterial infections.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiogenic shock, due to underlying CAD and heart failure.
4. Coagulopathy leading to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
5. Electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
6. Infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections, due to immunosuppression and potential bacterial or viral pathogens.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation, due to underlying SLE or medication side effects.
8. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to underlying SLE or CAD.
9. Wound complications, such as infection or non-healing, due to underlying vasculitis and Raynaud's disease.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for potential complications and adjusting treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute heart failure. She has a history of stroke and has been taking long-term management with CellCept and prednisone.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs, and she has required multiple interventions, including intubation, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation. She has also been treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infectious complications:
	* Meningitis/encephalitis due to viral, bacterial, or fungal agents
	* Sepsis secondary to bacteremia or fungemia
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
2. Cardiovascular complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, including tachycardia and bradycardia
	* Cardiac tamponade or pericarditis
	* Myocardial infarction or cardiac rupture
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Pneumothorax or hemothorax
	* Tracheal stenosis or tracheomalacia
4. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures or status epilepticus
	* Neurological deterioration or worsening of cognitive function
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
5. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia or bleeding diathesis
	* Thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis
	* Hemolytic anemia or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
6. Endocrine complications:
	* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
	* Adrenal insufficiency or hyperadrenalism
	* Thyroid dysfunction or parathyroid crisis

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely.
2. Perform a thorough neurological examination to assess for any changes in cognitive function or neurological deficits.
3. Continue to treat the patient's underlying conditions, including SLE, CAD, and chronic kidney disease.
4. Consider the use of prophylactic antibiotics or antivirals to prevent secondary infections.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
6. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
8. Consider the use of pain management medications to control the patient's pain and discomfort.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide adequate caloric intake to support her recovery.
10. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan  Assessment and Plan: 42F with SLE with
   cryoglobulinemia vasculitis CAD s/p MI and stenting (EF 20%) ICD,
   presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis,
   PNA, osteomyeltis), Metabolic (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroid, hypernatremia), Medication induced
   (opiates, withdrawl), Structural (although no evidence Normal Pressure
   Hydrocephalus), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis, stroke), Seizure (pt with
   prior hx). Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital1 12**] MRI,
   SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis
   remain high in the differential. Other aseptic meningitidies (viral,
   TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the differential).  Still
   unclear etiology, infection (meningitis/encephalitis) and lupus
   cerebritis remain high on the differential.
   - follow neuro exam, following commands this morning
   - BCx pending, CSF viral culture (-)
   - f/u results of LP, no suggestion of meningitits at this time
   - Cont empiric coverage for meningitis given immunosuppression
   (Ampicillin/Acyclovir)
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Trend and correct electrolyte disturbances
   - TSH high normal
   - if extubated this morning, will place on methadone IV standing and
   morphine IV PRN for home opiate use, diazepam IV vs. ativan standing
   for home benzodiazapine use
   - f/u EEG results, appreciate Neuro recs
   - f/u OSH cultures
   - f/u Rheum recs, appreciate input -> ? to Rheum re: specific diagnosis
   of SLE cerebritis
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - likely extubation this morning, pt wants tube out, RSBI 25
   - goal even to (-) 1 liter today
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation
 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)- complicated by cryoglobulinemia
   vasculitis.  Patient currently on long term management with CellCept,
   Prednisone.  Question if lupus cerebritis could be etiology of altered
   mental status.
   - cont Cellcept, methylprednisone per Rheum, appreciate input
   - f/u numerous follow up serologic and CSF studies
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC-
   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  Initially held beta
   blockade, will restart today.  TTE confirms severe systolic heart
   failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.
   - metoprolol
   - TBB as above
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)- Holding
   clopidogrel in setting of possible hemorrhage.  ? why patient is not on
   aspirin at home.
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Elevated troponins from
   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hemorrhage.  Most likely [**1-15**] withdrawal in the setting of systolic CHF.
   - cont beta blockade for improved rate control
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC- Significant Hct drop over past 24 hours.  No
   evidence of active hemorrhage on exam.  No evidence of hemolysis.  Pt
   did not receive PRBCs yesterday, Hct improved to 29 from 25 yesterday.
   - active type and screen
   - goal Hct > 25
   - trend Hct
 [**Name (NI) 10996**] Pt presented with INR of 3.9 without signs of bleeding.
   INR noted to be 4.1 on [**12-22**] at OSH, and was 1.9 on presentation to OSH.
   This was WNL on presentation, may have been secondary to antibiotics.
   Unclear whether patient received warfarin or other anti-coagulation at
   OSH.  Patient has received vitamin K x 1, FFP x 2.  INR has normalized.
   - trend coags
   - f/u inhibitor and anti-coagulants
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)-  The patient is on Methadone
   40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient for vasculitis.  See
   above for equivalents to home opiate and benzo use.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: altered mental status

   Disposition:  [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponins, indicating possible cardiac injury, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypokalemia.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). She requires mechanical ventilation and has a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with altered mental status and possible sepsis. She has a history of stroke and lupus cerebritis, which may be contributing to her current symptoms.

The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She has a history of cardiac disease and is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, type II, and chronic anemia. She is taking several medications, including CellCept, Prednisone, and Metoprolol, which may be contributing to her current condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and possible sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac disease and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central venous catheters may increase her risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies and history of bleeding may lead to bleeding complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible sepsis may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address her altered mental status, respiratory failure, and other medical concerns."

   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  Initially held beta
   blockade, will restart today.  TTE confirms severe systolic heart
   failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.
   - metoprolol
   - will need diuresis post-extubation
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)- Holding
   clopidogrel in setting of possible hemorrhage.  ? why patient is not on
   aspirin at home.
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Elevated troponins from
   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hemorrhage.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) complicated by cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and Heart Failure (CHF). She presented to the hospital with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She was intubated for respiratory distress and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, suggestive of demand ischemia. She has a history of stroke, and her SLE may be contributing to her altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: Given the patient's history of stroke and SLE, meningitis is a potential complication. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is pending, and the healthcare team is considering the possibility of aseptic meningitis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. The healthcare team is monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to acute lung injury or flash pulmonary edema. The healthcare team is considering the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is monitoring the patient's respiratory status closely.
4. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely secondary to her underlying CAD and CHF. The healthcare team is monitoring the patient's cardiac status closely and considering the possibility of cardiac catheterization.
5. Stroke: The patient's history of stroke and her current altered mental status suggest the possibility of a new stroke. The healthcare team is monitoring the patient's neurologic status closely and considering the possibility of neuroimaging studies.
6. SLE cerebritis: The patient's SLE may be contributing to her altered mental status, and the healthcare team is considering the possibility of SLE cerebritis.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and her history of SLE and CAD make her susceptible to infectious complications. The healthcare team is monitoring the patient's laboratory results and clinical status closely for signs of infection.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, or heart failure.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and consider the possibility of weaning from the ventilator.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider the possibility of cardiac catheterization.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider the possibility of neuroimaging studies.
5. Consider the possibility of SLE cerebritis and monitor the patient's mental status closely.
6. Monitor the patient's laboratory results and clinical status closely for signs of infection.
7. Consider the possibility of meningitis and continue to monitor the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis results."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be inferred:

**Summary:**

The patient is an intubated ICU patient with altered mental status, suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and heart failure (CHF) on chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). They have a history of chronic anemia, coagulopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with mechanical ventilation, and their laboratory results indicate possible infection, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's respiratory viral screen and culture are negative, but the wound culture shows sparse growth of Staph aureus and Corynebacterium species. This suggests the possibility of localized infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis.
3. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's PT, PTT, and INR results are elevated, indicating coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. **Heart Failure:** The patient's CHF is likely exacerbated by their CAD and may require further management, including diuretics and vasodilators.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be related to chronic blood loss, inflammatory response, or underlying bone marrow disorder, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia, which may require correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. **Delirium:** The patient's altered mental status may be related to underlying medical conditions, medications, or sleep deprivation, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. **Pain Management:** The patient's pain is not well-controlled, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to prevent pain-related complications.

Based on this summary and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely, and to adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan  Assessment and Plan: 42F with SLE with
   cryoglobulinemia vasculitis CAD s/p MI and stenting (EF 20%) ICD,
   presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis,
   PNA, osteomyeltis), Metabolic (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroid, hypernatremia), Medication induced
   (opiates, withdrawl), Structural (although no evidence Normal Pressure
   Hydrocephalus), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis, stroke), Seizure (pt with
   prior hx). Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital1 12**] MRI,
   SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis
   remain high in the differential. Other aseptic meningitidies (viral,
   TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the differential).
   - follow neuro exam, still not following commands
   - BCx, UCx, Wound Cx pending
   - Review OSH records
   - f/u results of LP, no suggestion of meningitits at this time
   - Cont empiric coverage for meningitis given immunosuppression
   (Ampicillin/Acyclovir), will d/c vanc/ceftraixone
   - ID consult for ? listeria/aseptic meningitis
   - Trend and correct electrolyte disturbances
   - TSH high normal
   - if extubated, will place on methadone IV standing and morphine IV PRN
   for home opiate use, diazepam IV vs. ativan standing for home
   benzodiazapine use
   - f/u EEG results -> will ask Neuro consult service for possible 24
   hour EEG monitoring
   - f/u OSH cultures
   - f/u Neuro and Rheum recs, appreciate input -> ? to Rheum re: specific
   diagnosis of SLE cerebritis
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows
   - if extubated, will likely need diuresis
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation
 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)- complicated by cryoglobulinemia
   vasculitis.  Patient currently on long term management with CellCept,
   Prednisone.  Question if lupus cerebritis could be etiology of altered
   mental status.
   - cont Cellcept, methylprednisone per Rheum, appreciate input
   - f/u numerous follow up serologic and CSF studies
   - will consult Plastics for right leg wound, continue with local wound
   care
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC-
   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  Initially held beta
   blockade, will restart today.  TTE confirms severe systolic heart
   failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.
   - metoprolol
   - will need diuresis post-extubation
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)- Holding
   clopidogrel in setting of possible hemorrhage.  ? why patient is not on
   aspirin at home.
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Elevated troponins from
   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hemorrhage.
   - will start beta blockade for rate control
   - will need diuresis post-extubation
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC- Significant Hct drop over past 24 hours.  No
   evidence of active hemorrhage on exam.
   - trend Hct, guaiac alimentary output
   - evaluate for hemolysis, active type and screen
   - goal Hct > 25
   - if Hct cont to drop, will transfuse 2 units PRBCs, non-contrast CT
   torso to eval for hemorrhage
 [**Name (NI) 10996**] Pt presented with INR of 3.9 without signs of bleeding.
   INR noted to be 4.1 on [**12-22**] at OSH, and was 1.9 on presentation to OSH.
   This was WNL on presentation, may have been secondary to antibiotics.
   Unclear whether patient received warfarin or other anti-coagulation at
   OSH.  Patient has received vitamin K x 1, FFP x 2.  INR near normal
   now.
   - trend coags
   - f/u inhibitor and anti-coagulants
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)-  The patient is on Methadone
   40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient for vasculitis.  See
   above for equivalents to home opiate and benzo use.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and stenting, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes such as meningitis, sepsis, and pneumonia, as well as metabolic causes such as hypoxia, hypercalcemia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which may be due to stress-induced myocardial injury or a previous MI. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a high potassium level and low calcium level.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 433, indicating severe hypoxia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's cardiac status is also critical, with a severe systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient is on beta blockade and will require diuresis post-extubation.

The patient's anemia is significant, with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL. The patient's platelet count is low, with a level of 269,000/mm3.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.1, which may be due to warfarin therapy or liver dysfunction.

The patient's pain control is inadequate, with a high dose of methadone and oxycodone required to manage chronic pain.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is poorly controlled, with a blood glucose level of 146 mg/dL.

The patient's nutritional status is inadequate, with a low albumin level and a high creatinine level.

The patient's risk of complications is high, with a risk of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and sepsis.

The patient's code status is ""full,"" indicating that the patient has the potential to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest.

The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] unit.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest due to severe systolic heart failure and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised, and there is a risk of sepsis due to the presence of catheters and other invasive devices.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and there is a risk of bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of catheters.
5. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of renal failure due to the presence of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is critical, and there is a risk of neurological complications due to the presence of altered mental status and seizures.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised, and there is a risk of infection due to the presence of catheters and other invasive devices.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute heart failure. She was previously intubated and has now been extubated without incident. The patient's condition remains altered, but has improved from admission. She is experiencing periods of apnea overnight, which may be related to sleep apnea, central, or obstructive. Her oxygen saturation did not correlate with poor PaO2, and she was placed on high-flow face mask oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, and she has received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy. She is taking various medications, including CellCept, Prednisone, metoprolol, and plavix.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sleep apnea: The patient's apneic episodes may be related to sleep apnea, which can worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central venous catheters increase her risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and chronic heart failure puts her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to lupus cerebritis, encephalitis, or other neurological conditions, which can worsen her cognitive function and increase her risk of seizures or stroke.
5. Wound complications: The patient's wound on her right foot may become infected or develop complications, such as cellulitis or abscesses, which can worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely, and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Consider performing a sleep study to determine the cause of the patient's apneic episodes.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
4. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis or encephalitis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection or complications, and consider performing debridement and dressing changes as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   42F with SLE with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis CAD s/p MI and stenting
   (EF 20%) ICD, presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
   .
   PEA ARREST:
   Unclear cause of arrest, possibly hypoxemia/hypotension in
   peri-intubation period. PE or MI also on ddx. Started on neo, dopa, IVF
   with bicarb, intubated with stable 02 sats on Fi02 100%. Lactate 15.
   - maintain CVP 10-12, use dopamine first, add on levo as needed
   - cont D5 with 150meq bicarb for acidemia
   - consult artic sun team about cooling protocol in setting of
   cryoglobulinemia
   - cycle CE, repeat TTE
   - LENIs
   - consider head CT if stable enough in PM
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (encephalitis), Metabolic (hypoxia,),
   Medication induced (opiates, withdrawal), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis,
   stroke), Seizure (pt with prior hx). Other aseptic meningitidies
   (viral, TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the
   differential).  Withdrawal process seems highest on ddx currently,
   since patient improved yesterday without high dose steroids, making SLE
   cerebritis/CNS vasculitis less likely. Pt did best while on midazolam,
   and was not getting adequate benzo
s after extubation she not taking
   POs.
   - consult psych for conservative taper regimen of benzos, keep
   comfortable on midaz for today
   - Cont empiric coverage for meningitis given immunosuppression
   (Ampicillin/Acyclovir)

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Extubated [**12-26**] then
   re-intubated for tachypnea this morning. Had periods apnea overnight (5
   sec) that were difficult to interpret- central vs. obstructive sleep
   apnea possible
   - maintain on AC, vent settings to keep pt comfortable for today
 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)- complicated by cryoglobulinemia
   vasculitis.  Patient currently on long term management with CellCept,
   Prednisone.  Question if lupus cerebritis could be etiology of altered
   mental status.
   - cont Cellcept, methylprednisone per Rheum, appreciate input
   - f/u numerous follow up serologic and CSF studies
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC-
   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  TTE confirms severe
   systolic heart failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.
   - cont metoprolol
   - f/u repeat TTE
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   - cont plavix
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Initially had demand
   trop leak. Improved with metoprolol yesterday. Most likely [**1-15**]
   pain/agitation/withdrawal in the setting of systolic CHF.
   - cont beta blockade for improved rate control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which was initially thought to be due to infectious, metabolic, or medication-induced causes. However, the patient's mental status improved without high-dose steroids, making SLE cerebritis/CNS vasculitis less likely. The patient was extubated without incident but required re-intubation for tachypnea and periods of apnea overnight, which may be related to central or obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and cardiac failure, systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further mechanical ventilation to manage her respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac condition is severe, and she may require further management to improve her cardiac function.
3. Sleep apnea: The patient's apneic episodes may be related to central or obstructive sleep apnea, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines make her susceptible to infection.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
6. Pain management: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain management require careful consideration to avoid opioid withdrawal.
7. Wound care: The patient's wound requires regular debridement and wound vacuum therapy to prevent further complications.
8. Diabetes management: The patient's history of type II diabetes requires close monitoring to prevent hyperglycemia.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance requires close monitoring and correction to prevent further complications.
10. Neurological compromise: The patient's altered mental status may be related to neurological compromise, which requires further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac failure with medications and further evaluation.
3. Evaluate the patient's sleep apnea and consider further management with positive airway pressure therapy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and take precautions to prevent infection.
5. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's pain with opioids and non-opioid analgesics as necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's wound with regular debridement and wound vacuum therapy.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's diabetes and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalance and correct as necessary.
10. Evaluate the patient's neurological compromise and consider further management with anticonvulsants or sedatives as necessary."
