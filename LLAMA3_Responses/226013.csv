   Overnight, became hypotensive with low urine outputs, BP responded to
   multiple boluses of IVF.  Further improvement in BP occurred with
   decrease in PEEP from 10 to 5 and discontinuation of epidural.  The
   patient did not require re-starting pressors.
   This morning improved blood pressures to SBP of 110s, oxygenating in
   low 90s
   UOP continues to be ~25cc/hr.
   This morning, RSBI is 50, pt. was noted to have copious white
   secretions, and SBT stopped short.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Respiratory status: The patient is currently intubated on mechanical
   ventilation.  Mental status appropriate for extubation.  RSBI favorable
   for extubation. The barriers to extubation at this point are pain
   control and copious secretions, which may be suggestive of an acute
   infectious process, although there are no fevers or elevated WBC
   counts, and CXR does not show clear evidence of PNA.
   - Repeat CXR this AM
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - wean off profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - Plan for extubation after a few hours of observation if pain and
   secretions are under control.
   .
   # Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   # Pain control:  The patient re-started on epidural this AM.
   - appreciate continued pain service recs
   - continue epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - Adjust doses to maintain adequate pain control
   # Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -Continue Ancef 2mg q6hrs while JP tubes are in place
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:  Hold for now given hypotension overnight.
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if pt. Becomes hypertensive
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: NPO for now
   .
   #) Access: TLC, a-line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy. She is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for hypotension, low urine output, and hypoxemia.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 50, indicating a favorable condition for extubation. However, pain control and copious secretions are barriers to extubation at this point.

The patient's urine output is improving with IVF administration, but remains low at 25cc/hr. A bladder scan and Foley flush did not reveal any evidence of obstruction.

The patient's pain control is being managed with epidural anesthesia, and she is receiving senna and colace for bowel care.

The patient's ovarian mass and post-operative issues are being managed with JP drains and wound care, and she is receiving antibiotics.

The patient's hypoxemia is being managed with oxygen therapy, and a repeat CXR is planned to rule out acute hypoxemia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's asthma is being managed with albuterol, and she will need to start Advair when extubated.

The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding anti-hypertensive medications for now, and she will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if she becomes hypertensive.

The patient's diabetes is being managed by holding Glyburide and Metformin for now, and she will need to follow up with her primary care physician for further management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still experience respiratory failure if her pain and secretions are not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's copious secretions and low urine output may be indicative of an acute infectious process, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may be due to acute or chronic lung disease, which could worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Wound infection: The patient's JP drains and wound care may increase the risk of wound infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed appropriately, which could lead to cardiovascular complications.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis if not managed appropriately, which could be life-threatening.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxemia and copious secretions may be indicative of pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.

Based on the patient's current status and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain and secretions to prevent respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust her fluid management as necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypoxemia with oxygen therapy and consider repeating CXR to rule out acute hypoxemia or chronic COPD.
5. Manage the patient's hypertension by holding anti-hypertensive medications for now and restarting Procardia and HCTZ if necessary.
6. Manage the patient's diabetes by holding Glyburide and Metformin for now and following up with her primary care physician for further management.
7. Monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection and adjust her wound care as necessary to prevent wound infection."

   [**2154-10-1**] after she presented to the ED with one year of increasing
   pelvic discomfort. She was then seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Gyn-Onc who
   arranged for ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   .
   Per anesthesia and surgery, the patient tolerated surgery well with 400
   cc blood loss, but reduced urine output requiring 4l NS. She was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma, who underwent an ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large pelvic mass. She was intubated in the operating room and remains intubated in the ICU due to her extensive surgery and low urine output. She has been receiving IV fluids and blood products to manage her hypotension and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity. She has a family history of diabetes and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to her respiratory compromise and may be exacerbated by her obesity and sleep apnea.
2. Low urine output: The patient's low urine output may be due to her third spacing and may require further evaluation and management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to her surgery and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxemia and low lung volumes on her chest x-ray may indicate the presence of pneumonia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and obesity may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's surgery and critical illness may increase her risk of developing stress ulcer.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise and hypoxemia may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support and oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Evaluate and manage the patient's low urine output and hypotension.
4. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's hypoxemia, including a repeat chest x-ray and consideration of a computed tomography angiogram.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.
6. Continue to provide stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider further evaluation and management of the patient's risk factors for stress ulcer.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further evaluation and management if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a large right adnexal mass and remains intubated due to respiratory failure. She has a history of moderate pulmonary hypertension, asthma, and sleep apnea. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Persistent, with a significant A-a difference on FiO2 of 0.5. She has copious secretions, and radiographic evidence of LLL density (possible atelectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).
* Hypoxemia: Attributed to LLL infiltrate and background of sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. She is stable overnight on mechanical ventilation, and weaning of SaO2 is planned as tolerated, with a goal of SaO2 >90% and pO2 >60 mmHg.
* Pulmonary infiltrate: Likely atelectasis, but at risk for pneumonia. Monitoring with a low threshold for antimicrobials is recommended.
* Oliguria: Surgery team goal is 20 cc/hr, and iv fluid repletion is continued for low urine output.
* Hypotension: Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects (epidural catheter). Now improved.
* Fluids: Hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related to surgery. Continuation of fluid repletion and monitoring of CVP is recommended.
* Hypomagnesemia: Repletion via iv is recommended.
* Pain, incisional: Persists, and optimization of pain regimen is recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged intubation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory muscle weakness.
* Hypoxemia: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Pulmonary infiltrate: Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion.
* Oliguria: Acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalance, and fluid overload.
* Hypotension: Hypovolemic shock, cardiac arrest, and organ dysfunction.
* Fluids: Fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Hypomagnesemia: Muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
* Pain, incisional: Chronic pain, opioid dependence, and respiratory depression.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial this AM.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   RSBI= 50 --> placed on SBT with IPS=5 and PEEP= 8.  SBT curtailed due
   to significant coughing.
   Copiou secretions, although clear.
   Experienced hypotension overnight.
   Exhibited low urine output.
   Continued to receive iv fluiids with some response.  Did not require
   vasopressor.
   BP improved with discontinuation of epidural anesthesia --> receiving
   iv bolus for pain management.  Epidural catheter resumed this AM.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a large right adnexal mass and remains intubated post-operatively. She has a history of moderate pulmonary hypertension, asthma, and sleep apnea. The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with persistent respiratory failure and hypoxemia attributed to a pulmonary infiltrate, likely atelectasis, and background conditions. She is also experiencing oliguria, hypotension, and hypomagnesemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient's pulmonary infiltrate, likely atelectasis, may progress to pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen, leading to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output may indicate kidney injury or failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.
6. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's hypomagnesemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
7. Infection: The patient's surgical site and pulmonary infiltrate may become infected, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrate may progress to pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
10. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria may progress to renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.

Based on the patient's critical condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications and optimize her chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial this AM.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.  Remained intubated primarly for airway mangement following
   anesthesia/paralytics.  Copious secretions, and radiographic evidence
   for LLL density (possible attalectasis vs. evolving infiltrate).  Hope
   to work towards extubation trial this AM.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  Monitor, with low threhold for antimicrobials.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent TAH-BSO, omentectomy, and resection of a large right adnexal mass. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, attributed to underlying asthma and pulmonary hypertension. She has a significant A-a difference on FiO2 of 0.5 and radiographic evidence of left lower lobe (LLL) density, which may be due to atelectasis or evolving infiltrate.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which improved after discontinuation of epidural anesthesia, and is now receiving iv fluids with some response. She has low urine output and is receiving iv fluid repletion to achieve a goal of 20 cc/hr. Her pain is being managed with iv opioids, and her surgical incision is tender.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: Persistent, attributed to underlying asthma and pulmonary hypertension. The patient will continue to be mechanically ventilated, and a trial of extubation will be attempted this morning.
2. Hypoxemia: Attributed to LLL infiltrate and background of sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. The patient will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated, with a goal of maintaining SaO2 >90% and pO2 >60 mmHg.
3. Pulmonary Infiltrate: Likely atelectasis, but at risk for pneumonia. The patient will be monitored closely, with a low threshold for antimicrobial therapy.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is low, and iv fluid repletion will continue to achieve a goal of 20 cc/hr.
5. Hypotension: Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects (epidural catheter). The patient's blood pressure has improved, but will continue to be monitored closely.
6. Fluids: The patient is hypovolemic due to intraabdominal third spacing related to surgery. iv fluids will continue to be administered to replete the patient's volume status.
7. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are low, and iv magnesium repletion will be considered.
8. Pain: The patient's incisional pain persists, and will continue to be managed with iv opioids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient's pulmonary infiltrate may progress to pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria may worsen if not managed properly, leading to acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's hypomagnesemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and weaning as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's pulmonary infiltrate closely, with a low threshold for antimicrobial therapy.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with iv fluids and vasopressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output closely, with a goal of achieving 20 cc/hr.
5. Continue to manage the patient's pain with iv opioids and other analgesics as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including magnesium, and correct any imbalances promptly.
7. Consider repeating cardiac echo to assess right side and consider CTA if the patient remains hypoxemic."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Respiratory status: The patient is extubated. The barriers to
   extubation at this point are pain control and copious secretions, which
   may be suggestive of an acute infectious process, although there are no
   fevers or elevated WBC counts, and CXR does not show clear evidence of
   PNA.
   - Repeat CXR this AM
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - wean off profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - Plan for extubation after a few hours of observation if pain and
   secretions are under control.
   .
   # Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   # Pain control:  The patient re-started on epidural this AM.
   - appreciate continued pain service recs
   - continue epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - Adjust doses to maintain adequate pain control
   # Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -Continue Ancef 2mg q6hrs while JP tubes are in place
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:  Hold for now given hypotension overnight.
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if pt. Becomes hypertensive
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with
   large ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy.
   # Respiratory status: The patient is extubated. The barriers to
   extubation at this point are pain control and copious secretions, which
   may be suggestive of an acute infectious process, although there are no
   fevers or elevated WBC counts, and CXR does not show clear evidence of
   PNA.
   - Repeat CXR this AM
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - wean off profopol
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - VAP bundle
   - Plan for extubation after a few hours of observation if pain and
   secretions are under control.
   .
   # Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   # Pain control:  The patient re-started on epidural this AM.
   - appreciate continued pain service recs
   - continue epidural anesthesia
   - senna/colace
   - Adjust doses to maintain adequate pain control
   # Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -Continue Ancef 2mg q6hrs while JP tubes are in place
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations
   of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a year ago but
   appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge documentation
   describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77
   while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the question that this
   may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing  e.g. secondary to
   moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes on left side in
   particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left
   hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decrease
   ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - repeat CXR
   - if hypoxia persists will consider CTA
   - CPAP at night after extubation
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   .
   # Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   # HTN:  Hold for now given hypotension overnight.
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   - will likely restart Procardia and HCTZ if pt. Becomes hypertensive
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a large ovarian mass, s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy. She is currently extubated and has been experiencing fever, with a temperature of 101.7°F. Her respiratory status is improving, but she still has coarse, low-pitched expiratory wheezing and rhonchi. Her cardiac status is stable, with no murmurs or gallop rhythms noted. Her abdominal exam is soft, with hypoactive bowel sounds, and no masses or organomegaly.

The patient has been experiencing low urine output, which is improving with IV fluid administration. Her pain control is being managed with epidural anesthesia, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for her ovarian mass. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, but no evidence of infection or organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's fever, wheezing, and rhonchi may indicate an acute infectious process, which could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows possible RLL pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status and lead to pneumonia if not treated promptly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death if not recognized and treated promptly.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia, despite being on 50% FiO2, may indicate underlying lung disease or pulmonary hypertension, which could worsen her respiratory status.
5. Post-operative complications: The patient's ovarian mass and recent surgery may lead to post-operative complications, such as wound infection, bleeding, or organ damage.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may require adjustment of her medication regimen and close monitoring to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require adjustment of her medication regimen and close monitoring to prevent complications such as cardiac failure or stroke.
8. Low urine output: The patient's low urine output may indicate dehydration or kidney damage, which could worsen her overall condition.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal status, as well as her diabetes, hypertension, and low urine output. Prompt recognition and treatment of potential complications are crucial to ensure the patient's well-being and prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with copious
   respiratory secretions. Temperature spike O/N and New infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for RLL PNA, for which Vanc/ Zosyn started as empiric
   coverage for HAP.  : Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline
   saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a
   year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge
   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with copious
   respiratory secretions. Temperature spike O/N and New infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for RLL PNA, for which Vanc/ Zosyn started as empiric
   coverage for HAP.  : Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline
   saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a
   year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge
   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and is currently experiencing new respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough, and diffuse coarse expiratory wheezing and rhonchi.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is only 91% on 50% FiO2, indicating significant hypoxemia. This could lead to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows a possible RLL pneumonia, which could progress to a more severe infection if not treated appropriately.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis could indicate the presence of a systemic infection, which could lead to sepsis if not managed promptly.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal pain and distension could indicate the development of abdominal compartment syndrome, which could lead to organ failure if not recognized and treated promptly.
5. Post-operative complications: The patient's ongoing pain, nausea, and vomiting could indicate post-operative complications, such as adhesions, bleeding, or infection, which could lead to prolonged recovery and increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia could indicate cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest, if not managed promptly.
7. Renal complications: The patient's low urine output could indicate the development of acute kidney injury or prerenal azotemia, which could lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not recognized and treated promptly.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of HAP and pneumonia.
2. Monitor secretions closely and maintain SaO2 >90%.
3. Continue PCA for pain management.
4. Monitor urine output and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
5. Continue to hold anti-hypertensives and anti-diabetic medications.
6. Consider repeat Echo as an outpatient.
7. Follow up with Gyn/onc recs and pathology.
8. Continue wound care and JP drains per surgery.
9. Monitor for signs of sepsis and abdominal compartment syndrome.
10. Consider consultation with pulmonology, cardiology, and nephrology as needed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent complications and ensure optimal recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- s/p extubation.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 11**] have new RLL pneumonia.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Continue iv fluid repletion
   for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remain NPO while surgical ileus persists.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a TAH-BSO, omentectomy for a large R adnexal mass. She remains intubated post-op and has evidence of significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5. The patient has a history of moderate PA-HTN and asthma.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure: She is intubated and has evidence of significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5, indicating respiratory failure.
* Hypoxemia: The patient is hypoxemic, attributed to LLL infiltrate and background of sleep apnea, pulmonary HTN, and asthma.
* Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient has a LLL infiltrate, likely atelectasis, but at risk for pneumonia.
* Oliguria: The patient has low urine output, and the surgery team goal is to maintain a urine output of 20 cc/hr.
* Hypotension: The patient has hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects (epidural catheter).
* Fluids: The patient has hypovolemia due to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related to surgery, and fluid repletion is ongoing.
* Hypomagnesemia: The patient has hypomagnesemia, and IV magnesium repletion is indicated.
* Pain: The patient has persistent incisional pain, and the pain regimen is being optimized.
* Adnexal mass: The patient had a surgical resection of the adnexal mass, and pathology is pending.
* Nutritional support: The patient is NPO while surgical ileus persists.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to the LLL infiltrate and background of asthma.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly.
* Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen if not managed properly.
* Fluid overload: The patient may be at risk for fluid overload due to ongoing fluid repletion.
* Infection: The patient may be at risk for infection due to the surgical site and presence of an epidural catheter.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's pulmonary HTN and history of moderate PA-HTN may increase the risk of cardiac complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo woman s/p TAH-BSO, omentectomy for large R adnexal mass.
   Pathology pending.  Remains intubated post-op --> does have evidence of
   a significant A-a difference on FIO2 of 0.5.  She had been evaluated in
   the past as an inpatient by pulmonary and has known moderate PA-HTN by
   echo last year.  However, has documented normal sat from inpatient
   admission last month.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- s/p extubation.  Underlying Asthma and pulmonary
   HTN.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to LLL infiiltrate and background of sleep
   apnea, pulmonary HTN, asthma.  Stable overnight on mechanical
   ventilation.  Wean SaO2 as tolerated, maintain SaO2 >90%, pO2 >60
   mmHg.  Consider CTA if remains hypoxemic.   Consider repeat cardiac
   echo to assess right side.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likley atalectasis, but at risk for
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 11**] have new RLL pneumonia.
   OLIGURIA -- surgery team goal of 20 cc/hr.  Concern for possible
   increased intraabdominal pressure
 check bladder pressure. Continue iv
   fluid repletion for low urine output.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects
   (epidural catheter).  Now improved.  Monitor MAP, maintain MAP> 60
   mmHg.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, attributed to intraabdominal 3rd spacing related
   to surgery.  Continue to replete, monitor CVP.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA -- replete iv.
   PAIN, INCISIONAL -- persists.  Continue to optimize pain regimen.
   ADENEXAL MASS -- s/p surgical resection.  Pathology pending.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remain NPO while surgical ileus persists.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, and resection of a large right adnexal mass. She remains intubated post-op and has been experiencing respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and oliguria. She has a history of moderate pulmonary hypertension, asthma, and sleep apnea. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and mild hyponatremia. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying asthma and pulmonary hypertension increase her risk of respiratory failure, and her current hypoxemia may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrate, likely atelectasis, increases her risk of developing pneumonia, especially given her history of sleep apnea and asthma.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to hypovolemia and pharmacological effects of the epidural catheter. Close monitoring of her blood pressure and volume status is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's low magnesium levels may worsen her hypotension and arrhythmias. Replenishment of magnesium is necessary.
5. Intraabdominal hypertension: The patient's oliguria may be related to increased intraabdominal pressure, which can worsen her respiratory failure and other complications. Monitoring of her bladder pressure and fluid repletion are necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Nutritional support: The patient's NPO status and ongoing surgical ileus require close monitoring of her nutritional status and potential supplementation.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal surgery and current stressors may increase her risk of adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of her cortisol levels and potential supplementation are necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean the patient's FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's pulmonary infiltrate and consider a computed tomography (CT) scan if it persists.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluid repletion and pharmacological support.
4. Replenish the patient's magnesium levels.
5. Monitor the patient's bladder pressure and fluid repletion to prevent intraabdominal hypertension.
6. Continue to optimize the patient's pain regimen.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider supplementation if necessary.
8. Consider repeat cardiac echo to assess the patient's right side.
9. Consider stress testing to assess the patient's cardiac function.
10. Monitor the patient's cortisol levels and consider supplementation if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.

   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a large ovarian mass, s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). She is currently extubated, with decreased cough and secretions, and is hypoxic despite being on 4L nasal cannula oxygen. Her lab results show acute kidney injury (AKI) with a Cr bump from 1.1 to 2.0, and her urine output (UOP) is low. She has abdominal pain, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxemia and RLL PNA may lead to further respiratory deterioration, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's AKI may progress to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
4. Infection Complications: The patient's pneumonia and possible VAP may lead to sepsis, septic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, which could be life-threatening.
6. Hematological Complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which could exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged ICU stay may lead to malnutrition, which could impair her recovery and increase the risk of complications.
8. Psychological Complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay, pain, and discomfort may lead to anxiety, depression, and other psychological complications that could impact her recovery and quality of life.

These potential medical complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent or minimize their occurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn day 1.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with copious
   respiratory secretions. Temperature spike O/N and New infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for RLL PNA, for which Vanc/ Zosyn started as empiric
   coverage for HAP.  : Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline
   saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a hospitalization a
   year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago with discharge
   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   - hold anti-HTN for now given hypo/hyper-HTN today and low UOP
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is hypoxic given
   PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This raises the
   question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long standing
   e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. His CXR shows [**Month (only) 202**] lung volumes
   on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor
   visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due
   to decrease ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn
   - Send sputum Cx
   - Monitor secretions closely
   - Monitor coughing, gag reflex.
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - RTC Tylenol
   - CPAP at night
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran for nausea/vomiting
   3. Low UOP:  Improving with administration of IVF, but still low.
   Bladder scan and Foley flush did not releval evidence of obsturction.
   She is now 8 L positive with fluid boluses. Likely post-operative
   causes in combination with opiates and lack of movement.
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   -d/c Ancef 2mg q6hrs as now on Vanc/ Zosyn
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - will need to start Advair in am when extubated
   - albuterol q4hrs

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and is currently extubated with copious respiratory secretions. She has a new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/111 mmHg. She has a low urine output (UOP) and is receiving IV fluids.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxemia/RLL PNA: The patient remains extubated with copious respiratory secretions, and a new infiltrate on CXR is concerning for RLL PNA. She is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, and will need to continue to monitor her respiratory secretions closely.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient is still experiencing significant pain and is being managed with PCA. She will need to continue to monitor her pain and consider repeat imaging to rule out any intra-abdominal complications.
3. Low UOP: The patient's UOP is improving with IV fluids, but is still low. She will need to continue to monitor her UOP and consider repeat imaging to rule out any obstruction.
4. Ovarian Mass/Post-Operative Issues: The patient will need to follow up with her gynecologist and oncologist for further evaluation and treatment of her ovarian mass.
5. Asthma: The patient has wheezing bilaterally and will need to start Advair in the morning when extubated.
6. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she will need to continue to monitor it closely.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale, and she will need to continue to monitor her blood glucose levels closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and RLL PNA put her at risk for respiratory failure, and she will need to continue to monitor her respiratory status closely.
2. Intra-abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and low UOP put her at risk for intra-abdominal complications, such as abscesses or perforation.
3. Wound complications: The patient's ovarian mass and panniculectomy put her at risk for wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's HTN and diabetes put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
5. Infections: The patient's RLL PNA and IV lines put her at risk for infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and diabetes put her at risk for nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Medication errors: The patient's multiple medications and IV lines put her at risk for medication errors, such as incorrect dosing or interactions."

   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure.
   1. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  The patient has also been hypercarbic, and
   this has been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - Start budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass- Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.
   -Urine lytes
   -Renal U/S with Dopplers
   -Checj Cr [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - re-start Advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   8. Anemia
 Hct trending down slowly to 27.3 today.  No evidence of
   active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -1 unit pRBCs today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure.
   1. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  The patient has also been hypercarbic, and
   this has been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - Start budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass- Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.
   -Urine lytes
   -Renal U/S with Dopplers

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and a large ovarian mass that was surgically removed. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula, and her respiratory rate is 17 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22 mg/dL
* Sodium: 18 mmol/L
* Osmolality: 342 mOsm/kg
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.4 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.2 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 28.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 94 K/μL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute renal failure (ARF) with a possible etiology of pre-renal vs. acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension post-operatively
* Hypoxemia with a persistent oxygen requirement
* Hypercarbia, which may be exacerbated by refusing to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night
* Asthma with wheezing bilaterally
* Ovarian mass with possible malignant cells
* Post-operative pain with a morphine PCA and Dilaudid PRN
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 27.3 g/dL
* Diabetes with a possible need to restart medications

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progression of AKI to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of JP drains and the risk of wound infection
* Respiratory failure requiring intubation
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anemia and possible need for transfusions
* Development of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin for coverage of VAP
* F/u sputum culture
* Continuing albuterol nebs and Advair for asthma
* Starting budesonide nebs for asthma
* Maintaining SaO2 >90
* Repeating CXR
* Considering repeat echocardiogram as an outpatient
* Discontinuing morphine PCA and starting Dilaudid PRN for post-operative pain
* Transfusing for anemia with a goal hemoglobin level of 30 or signs of active bleed
* F/u Hct as an outpatient
* Continuing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with evidence for new RLL PNA, on Vanc/
   Zosyn.
   1. Hypoxemia/ RLL PNA- patient remains extubated, with decreased cough
   and secretions.  Satting well on 4L NC. Per anesthesia, pre-op eval
   revealed baseline saturations of 85-89%. This is a consistant with a
   hospitalization a year ago but appears to be worse that 6 weeks ago
   with discharge documentation describing 98% RA. Currently, patient is
   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - RTC nebs q4hours
   - Re-start Advair
   - Monitor cough and secretions
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   2. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass- Patient still having significant amts
   of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.
   -Urine lytes
   -Renal U/S with Dopplers
   -Checj Cr [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP and tolerate UOP > 20 cc/hr.
   -Low theshold for IV boluses
   4 Ovarian Mass / Post-Operative Issues:
   - appreciate Gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   .
   5. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - re-start Advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   .
   6. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   7. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - SSI
   8. Anemia
 Hct trending down slowly to 27.3 today.  No evidence of
   active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -1 unit pRBCs today.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory status:
	* The patient remains extubated and is hypoxic, with a PaO2 of 77 on 50% FiO2.
	* The patient has a history of moderate pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, which may be contributing to the hypoxemia.
	* The patient is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn and Cipro for coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
	* The patient is also being monitored for cough and secretions, and is receiving nebulizers every 4 hours.
2. Renal status:
	* The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL.
	* The etiology of the AKI is unclear, but may be secondary to pre-renal or post-renal causes.
	* The patient is being monitored for urine output, and is receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia.
3. Cardiovascular status:
	* The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with hold on anti-hypertensives.
	* The patient has a low blood pressure, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 56 mmHg.
4. Gastrointestinal status:
	* The patient has a history of asthma and is being treated with Advair and albuterol.
	* The patient has a history of diabetes and is being managed with a sliding scale of regular insulin.
5. Surgical status:
	* The patient has undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH-BSO) and panniculectomy for ovarian mass.
	* The patient is still having significant amounts of pain and is being managed with Dilaudid PRN.
	* The patient is also being monitored for wound care and drainage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and low lung volumes may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's AKI and hypotension may be signs of sepsis, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
3. Wound infection: The patient's surgical site is at risk for infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure may be signs of hypovolemic shock, which needs to be managed promptly.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   hypoxic given PaO2 of only 77 while on 50% FiO2- A-a gradient 220. This
   raises the question that this may be acute hypoxemia or could be long
   standing  e.g. secondary to moderate pulm HTN/OSA. The patient refusing
   to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP, although
   radiographic findings could also be secondary to atelectasis
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - RTC nebs q4hours
   - Re-start Advair
   - Monitor cough and secretions
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - PCA Morphine (10mg/hr lockout) and RTC Tylenol for pain control
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - consider repeat Echo as oupt
   2. Abdominal Pain- Patient still having significant amts of pain,
   screams and wails every time she is turned- APS consulted -epidural
   discontinued and patient started on PCA
   - continue PCA
   - monitor pain
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   3. ARF/ Low UOP:  The patient was noted to have a Cr bump from 1.1 to
   2.0 today.  Etiology may be pre-renal vs. ATN secondary to hypotension
   post-opeeratively.  UOP continues to be low.  Bladder scan and Foley
   flush did not releval evidence of obstruction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with evidence of new right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). The patient remains extubated, with decreased cough and secretions, and is hypoxic on 4L nasal cannula. She has a significant amount of pain and is experiencing abdominal pain, which is being managed with PCA morphine. The patient's urine output is poor, and her creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 2.5 mg/dL, which may be due to pre-renal or ATN causes. She also has a history of anemia, and her hemoglobin level is trending down.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to RLL PNA, which may worsen hypoxemia and require more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to VAP or other infections, which may lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to ATN or pre-renal causes, which may require dialysis or further management.
4. Pneumonia or other respiratory complications due to atelectasis or other factors, which may require antibiotics and further respiratory support.
5. Hemorrhage or bleeding due to coagulopathy or other factors, which may require transfusion or other interventions.
6. Sepsis or septic shock due to abdominal or other sources, which may lead to organ dysfunction and death.
7. Pulmonary hypertension or other cardiovascular complications due to OSA or other factors, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. Infection or other complications related to JP drains and wound care, which may require further evaluation and management.

Further evaluation and management are needed to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient, Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**], is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and now presents with acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient remains extubated and requires supplemental oxygen. She has persistent hypercarbia, which has been exacerbated by her refusal to use CPAP at night. She is also experiencing wheezing bilaterally.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 90/56 mmHg, and her heart rate is 103 bpm. She has a sinus tachycardia.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by ATN in the setting of hypotension. Her urine output is poor, and her creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit level of 28.1%.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes, and her blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbia and requirement for supplemental oxygen increase her risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypotension increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis if not managed properly.
* Infection: The patient's presence of JP drains and wound care increases her risk of infection.
* Anemia progression: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as cardiac failure or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Diabetes complications: The patient's diabetes may lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or diabetic ketoacidosis if not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro for coverage of VAP
* F/u sputum Cx
* Continuing albuterol nebs and Advair
* Starting budesonide nebs
* Maintaining SaO2 >90
* Repeat CXR and consider repeat Echo as outpt
* Repeat cultures and lactic acid levels
* Monitoring urine output and creatinine levels
* Managing anemia with transfusions and follow-up Hct levels
* Continuing diabetes management with sliding scale insulin
* Monitoring for signs of infection and wound complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient remains extubated but requires oxygen supplementation. She has a persistent hypercarbic condition, which has been exacerbated by her refusal to use CPAP at night.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 113/61 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 97%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg and a bladder pressure of 17 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28.8 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L and a sodium level of 138 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes, obesity, and asthma. She has a large ovarian mass that was surgically removed, and she is currently experiencing pain and sedation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbic condition and requirement for oxygen supplementation put her at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ARF and low urine output may be indicative of sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Infection: The patient's wound culture and sputum culture are pending, and the presence of an infection could exacerbate her condition.
4. Organ failure: The patient's ARF and low urine output may indicate organ failure, which could have serious consequences.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and obesity may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and pain management may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. [**Name (NI) 9213**] pt remains anuric, w steadily rising Cr 5.5 today up from 4.4
   yesterday from baseline around 1.0 Likely etiology of ATN is
   hypoperfusion due to hypotension during operation.
   -- Renal c/s appreciated, will f/u all renal recs, ? possible HD in
   future and HD-access
   -- fluid boluses are for hypotension only as unlikely to affect UOP
   -- check U lytes, chem 7 [**Hospital1 **], monitor UOP
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  Has also been hypercarbic, and this has
   been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 3 of 8 day
   course, end in 5 days [**11-16**])
   - change zosyn to q8 dosing for renal function, hold vanc for today as
   level 31.2
   - check VBG today
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   - repeat cultures, lactic acid
   3. constipation- pt has not had bowel movement since prior to operation
   ~1 wk
   -- PR enemas, tap water enema
   -- ct bowel regimen
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   5. ARF/ Low UOP:  Likely [**2-4**] ARF.  UOP continues to be low.  Likely [**2-4**]
   ATN. No evidence of hydro on limited renal U/S.
   -Urine lytes
   -Check chem 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   -Use IV boluses PRN for hypotension but not for low urine output
   -Check Cr on JP drain output to assess to urinary tract injury
   (unlikely)
   .
   6. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   7. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   8. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - sliding scale insulin
   9. Anemia
 Hct stable.  No evidence of active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for intraabdominal bleeding
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Advance diet to sips.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's creatinine level has risen to 5.5 mg/dL, indicating ATN. The likely etiology is hypoperfusion due to hypotension during operation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains extubated and requires oxygen supplementation. She has persistent hypoxemia and hypercarbia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is worsening, which can lead to further complications if not addressed.
4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since prior to operation, which can lead to constipation and potential complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Pain Management: The patient is still experiencing significant pain, which can lead to decreased mobility and increased risk of complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of wound infection and is receiving antibiotics for coverage of VAP. It is essential to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but there is a risk of further blood loss or anemia if not managed properly.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes, and it is essential to monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
10. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is essential to monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and receive appropriate treatment, including:

* Continued antibiotic therapy for coverage of VAP
* Monitoring of renal function and urine output
* Management of pain and constipation
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as necessary
* Monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting antihypertensive therapy as necessary
* Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygen supplementation
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Advance diet to sips for nutrition
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Close communication with the patient and her family to ensure that all concerns are addressed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass and is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during the operation. She has a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy
* Hypercarbia
* Refusal to use CPAP at night
* Persistent O2 requirement
* ARF with low urine output (UOP) and likely ATN
* Pain management with morphine PCA and Dilaudid PRN
* Nausea and vomiting managed with Zofran and Compazine
* JP drains and wound care per surgery
* Anemia with a stable Hct, no evidence of active bleed
* Hypertension managed by holding anti-hypertensives
* Diabetes managed with sliding scale insulin
* Asthma managed with Advair, albuterol, and budesonide nebs

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening hypoxemia and hypercarbia due to refusal to use CPAP at night
2. Progression of ARF and ATN, potentially leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to VAP or other infections
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to ATN and low platelet count
5. Potential for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
6. Risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction
7. Potential for further metabolic complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, or hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia
8. Risk of gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation
9. Potential for further hematological complications, such as anemia, bleeding disorders, or blood clotting disorders
10. Risk of further complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, OSA, and asthma.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Consider repeating the CXR and echo to assess for any changes in lung or cardiac function.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine levels to assess for any changes in kidney function.
4. Consider repeating the cultures, lactic acid, and other lab tests to assess for any changes in the patient's condition.
5. Continue to manage the patient's pain, nausea, and vomiting with appropriate medications.
6. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care and management.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's kidney function and management.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and consider consulting with a cardiologist if necessary.
9. Consider repeating the CT abdomen/pelvis to assess for any changes in the patient's abdominal or pelvic anatomy.
10. Continue to follow the patient's progress and adjust the plan as necessary to ensure optimal care and management."

   Assessment and Plan
 ACTUE RENAL FAILURE:   Seocndary to ATN in setting of decreased
   perfusion.  Cr continues to rise, oliguric and approaching anuria.
   Muddy brown casts on sediment. Bladder pressures had been in normal
   range.  Renal service following, they will discuss need to start
   dialysis in which case access will need to be obtained.
  DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  RISS
 ANEMIA:  Hct slightly decreased albeit likely dilutional.  Check [**Hospital1 **]
   CBCs.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION:  No bowel movement for several days.  Biliious
   material from NGT, large amount.  CT abdomen concerning for early SBO.
   Will continue to monitor, try suppositories.  Probable ileus in postop
   setting and exacerbated by pain meds.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL) s/p exploratory laparotomy.
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA):  Exacerbated in the setting of pain
   meds with increased pC02 on blood gas. Not compensating appropriately
   in setting of worsening renal function and metabolic acidosis.
   Continue to monitor gases.  Have discussed use of CPAP, patient
   reluctant as it makes her feel her breathing is worse.  Will encourage
   use in the ICU.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE secondary to pneumonia.  Continues on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Remains extubated, no cough or sputum.
   Afebrile.  Still teneuous from a respiratory standpont given
   exacerbation of sleep apnea on pain meds as noted above.  Continue to
   monitor in ICU.
 ASTHMA:  Continues bronchodilators.  No wheeze on exam.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ACTUE RENAL FAILURE:   Seocndary to ATN in setting of decreased
   perfusion.  Cr continues to rise, oliguric and approaching anuria.
   Muddy brown casts on sediment. Bladder pressures had been in normal
   range.  Renal service following, they will discuss need to start
   dialysis in which case access will need to be obtained.
  DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  RISS
 ANEMIA:  Hct slightly decreased albeit likely dilutional.  Check [**Hospital1 **]
   CBCs.
 ABDOMINAL DISTENTION:  No bowel movement for several days.  Biliious
   material from NGT, large amount.  CT abdomen concerning for early SBO.
   Will continue to monitor, try suppositories.  Probable ileus in postop
   setting and exacerbated by pain meds.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL) s/p exploratory laparotomy.
 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA):  Exacerbated in the setting of pain
   meds with increased pC02 on blood gas. Not compensating appropriately
   in setting of worsening renal function and metabolic acidosis.
   Continue to monitor gases.  Have discussed use of CPAP, patient
   reluctant as it makes her feel her breathing is worse.  Will encourage
   use in the ICU.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE secondary to pneumonia.  Continues on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Remains extubated, no cough or sputum.
   Afebrile.  Still teneuous from a respiratory standpont given
   exacerbation of sleep apnea on pain meds as noted above.  Continue to
   monitor in ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She has a history of type II diabetes, anemia, and cancer (ovarian, uterine, cervical, and endometrial). She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for her pneumonia and has been extubated. She is receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and is being monitored for acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, and she is at risk for developing anuria.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and ATN increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure can worsen if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's somnolence and easy arousability to voice may indicate neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or seizures.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal distension and lack of bowel movement increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's pneumonia and ATN increase her risk of developing other infectious complications, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to eat and her ongoing use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increase her risk of developing nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. [**Name (NI) 9213**] pt remains anuric, w steadily rising Cr 5.5 today up from 4.4
   yesterday from baseline around 1.0 Likely etiology of ATN is
   hypoperfusion due to hypotension during operation.
   -- Renal c/s appreciated, will f/u all renal recs, ? possible HD in
   future and HD-access
   -- fluid boluses are for hypotension only as unlikely to affect UOP
   -- check U lytes, chem 7 [**Hospital1 **], monitor UOP
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  Has also been hypercarbic, and this has
   been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 3 of 8 day
   course, end in 5 days [**11-16**])
   - change zosyn to q8 dosing for renal function, hold vanc for today as
   level 31.2
   - check VBG today
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   - repeat cultures, lactic acid
   3. constipation- pt has not had bowel movement since prior to operation
   ~1 wk
   -- PR enemas, tap water enema
   -- ct bowel regimen
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   5. ARF/ Low UOP:  Likely [**2-4**] ARF.  UOP continues to be low.  Likely [**2-4**]
   ATN. No evidence of hydro on limited renal U/S.
   -Urine lytes
   -Check chem 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   -Use IV boluses PRN for hypotension but not for low urine output
   -Check Cr on JP drain output to assess to urinary tract injury
   (unlikely)
   .
   6. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   7. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   8. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - sliding scale insulin
   9. Anemia
 Hct stable.  No evidence of active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for intraabdominal bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. [**Name (NI) 9213**] pt remains anuric, w steadily rising Cr 5.5 today up from 4.4
   yesterday from baseline around 1.0 Likely etiology of ATN is
   hypoperfusion due to hypotension during operation.
   -- Renal c/s appreciated, will f/u all renal recs, ? possible HD in
   future and HD-access
   -- fluid boluses are for hypotension only as unlikely to affect UOP
   -- check U lytes, chem 7 [**Hospital1 **], monitor UOP
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  Has also been hypercarbic, and this has
   been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 3 of 8 day
   course, end in 5 days [**11-16**])
   - change zosyn to q8 dosing for renal function, hold vanc for today as
   level 31.2
   - check VBG today
   - F/u sputum Cx
   - Continue albuterol nebs
   - Continue Advair
   - continue budesonide nebs
   - maintain SaO2 >90
   - will need outpt pulm f/u
   - repeat CXR
   - consider repeat Echo as outpt
   - repeat cultures, lactic acid
   3. constipation- pt has not had bowel movement since prior to operation
   ~1 wk
   -- PR enemas, tap water enema
   -- ct bowel regimen
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology
 cytology negative for malignant cells, path of
   mass pending
   - JP drains and wound care per surgery
   5. ARF/ Low UOP:  Likely [**2-4**] ARF.  UOP continues to be low.  Likely [**2-4**]
   ATN. No evidence of hydro on limited renal U/S.
   -Urine lytes
   -Check chem 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   -Use IV boluses PRN for hypotension but not for low urine output
   -Check Cr on JP drain output to assess to urinary tract injury
   (unlikely)
   .
   6. Asthma: patient with wheezing bilaterally
   - continue advair
   - albuterol q4hrs standing
   - budesonide nebs
   .
   7. HTN:  continue to hold anti-hypertensives.  Will re-start if the
   patient becomes hypertensive.
   .
   8. Diabetes:
   - hold Glyburide and Metformin for now
   - sliding scale insulin
   9. Anemia
 Hct stable.  No evidence of active bleed
   -Given post-operative, transfuse for Hct goal of 30 or signs of active
   bleed.
   -follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, who underwent a laparoscopic hysterectomy and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation. The patient remains anuric, with steadily rising creatinine levels. She has persistent oxygen requirements and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has constipation, pain, and anemia. The patient's condition is being managed with various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and pain management agents.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and she remains anuric. This may lead to further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. VAP: The patient's oxygen requirements and risk of VAP are high, which may lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or other complications.
4. Pain management: The patient's pain is not well-controlled, which may lead to decreased mobility, respiratory compromise, and increased risk of complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which may exacerbate her underlying conditions.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements and risk of VAP may lead to respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
8. Sepsis: The patient's risk of VAP and ARF may lead to sepsis, which may require intensive care and potentially life-saving interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 54-year-old female, is a post-operative patient with a large ovarian mass, who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypoxemia, acute renal failure, and anuria. She has been diagnosed with ATN likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation. The patient remains anuric, with steadily rising creatinine levels. She also has hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and persistent oxygen requirement. Additionally, she has not had a bowel movement since prior to the operation, likely due to ileus post-surgically. The patient is experiencing significant pain, but is also quite sedated.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating ongoing kidney damage. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of sepsis.
2. **Pulmonary Complications**: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercarbia can worsen her respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and increased risk of sepsis.
3. **Bowel Obstruction**: The patient's ileus post-surgically can lead to bowel obstruction, which can cause further complications such as bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
4. **Sepsis**: The patient's anuria and rising creatinine levels increase her risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. **Pain Management**: The patient's significant pain can lead to decreased mobility, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, and potential respiratory complications if not managed effectively.
6. **Nutritional Complications**: The patient's anuria and ileus post-surgically can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased immune function.
7. **Cardiovascular Complications**: The patient's hypertension and anemia can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

**Recommendations:**

1. **HD cath placement**: To manage the patient's anuria and rising creatinine levels.
2. **Appreciate continued renal recs**: To monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. **IVF only as needed for hypotension**: To minimize the risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. **Monitor UOP and daily Cr**: To track the patient's urine output and creatinine levels to monitor for potential complications.
5. **Continue Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro**: To cover for VAP and other potential infections.
6. **F/u VBG and TTE**: To monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
7. **F/u Blood Cultures and Peritoneal fluid cultures**: To monitor for potential infections.
8. **Continue NGT on suction, NPO**: To manage the patient's ileus post-surgically.
9. **Add Miralax**: To help manage the patient's constipation.
10. **D/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN**: To manage the patient's pain effectively.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH/BSO) and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.22, pCO2 of 22 mmHg, and pO2 of 105 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese woman with a soft, tender abdomen at the incision site. She has right and left lower extremity edema, and her skin is warm. Her neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 7.1 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is 9.4 K/uL, and her platelet count is 324 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, and chloride level of 105 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which she is receiving treatment. She also has a history of ovarian cancer, for which she underwent a preliminary pathologic examination that showed benign findings.

The patient's current medications include insulin sliding scale, bronchodilators, and antibiotics, which are being held due to high levels of vancomycin in the setting of renal failure. She is also receiving pain management with dilaudid.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to respiratory failure and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis due to ATN and respiratory failure.
3. Dialysis-related complications, such as hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Wound infection or dehiscence due to the patient's anuric state and compromised immune function.
5. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to the patient's anuric state and compromised immune function.
6. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy, due to the patient's anuric state and compromised cardiac function.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction, due to the patient's anuric state and compromised gut function.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during the operation. She is currently on hemodialysis and has undergone one session with removal of 2 liters. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains at risk for hypoxemia, PNA, and asthma. She has not had bowel movement since prior to the operation and is likely experiencing ileus. She is also experiencing significant pain and is being managed with pain medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ATN: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during the operation. Continued hemodialysis and monitoring of renal function are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypoxemia/PNA/Asthma: The patient remains at risk for hypoxemia, PNA, and asthma, particularly with the continued use of antibiotics and sedatives. Monitoring of respiratory status and maintenance of SaO2 >90 are necessary.
3. Ileus: The patient's lack of bowel movement since prior to the operation and the return of bowel sounds today suggest the presence of ileus. Continued use of a nasogastric tube and bowel regimen are necessary to manage this condition.
4. Pain: The patient's significant pain is likely related to the surgical procedure and the presence of ileus. Continued management with pain medication and consideration of alternative pain management strategies are necessary.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and the need for TPN suggest that she is at risk for further malnutrition. Monitoring of nutrition and glycemic control are necessary to prevent malnutrition and hypoglycemia.
6. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct suggests that she is not actively bleeding, but continued monitoring of Hct and consideration of blood transfusions are necessary to manage anemia.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: Continue TPN to ensure adequate nutrition and glycemic control.
2. Glycemic Control: Use insulin sliding scale to manage hypoglycemia and prevent hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: Monitor the patient's lines and consider replacing them as necessary.
4. Prophylaxis: Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP as necessary.
5. Code Status: The patient's code status is full code, which means that all resuscitative efforts will be made in the event of cardiac arrest.

Disposition:

The patient is likely to be discharged to the floor today, pending further evaluation and management of her conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy for a large ovarian mass. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.4°C, Tcurrent 37.3°C, HR 86 bpm, BP 143/71 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Respiratory support: The patient remains extubated, but has a persistent oxygen requirement. She has been hypercarbic and has refused to use CPAP at night.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm, and her cardiac examination is normal.
* Pulmonary: The patient has rales at the left apex, but otherwise, her pulmonary examination is normal.
* Abdomen: The patient has a soft, obese, distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and a lower abdominal incision with dressing, clean, dry, and intact.
* Extremities: The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema, which is warm and well-perfused.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.8 K/μL
* Hct: 31.2%
* Plt: 418 K/μL
* Cr: 7.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 24 mmol/L
* Glucose: 126 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 15.1/32.5/1.3, differential neutrophils 89.3%, lymphocytes 5.1%, monocytes 3.5%, eosinophils 2.0%, lactic acid 1.1 mmol/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, calcium 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium 2.2 mg/dL, phosphorus 5.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She has a history of large ovarian mass, and her current diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to hypoperfusion during the operation.

The patient's plan includes:

* HD cath placement
* HD after cath placement
* IVF only as needed for hypotension
* Monitoring of urine output and daily creatinine levels
* Continue vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin for coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Continue albuterol nebs, Advair, and budesonide nebs for asthma
* Continue NGT on suction, NPO, and bowel regimen for ileus
* D/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN for pain management
* Continue Zofran and Compazine for nausea and vomiting
* Appreciate gynecologic oncology recommendations
* Follow-up pathology and cytology results

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further decline in renal function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Prolonged ileus
* Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Development of respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and hypercarbia
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged use of antibiotics and invasive lines

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old female, is a post-operative patient who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion during surgery. She remains anuric and has a steadily rising creatinine level. The patient is on hemodialysis and has a dialysis catheter in place. She has a persistent oxygen requirement and is hypercarbic. She is also experiencing ileus post-surgically and has not had a bowel movement since prior to the operation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's rising creatinine level and anuria suggest ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's persistent oxygen requirement and hypercarbic state can lead to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Ileus: The patient's lack of bowel movement since prior to surgery can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis if not managed promptly.
4. Wound Infection: The patient's surgical site is at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable hemoglobin level and lack of evidence of active bleeding suggest that she may be at risk for anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current lack of antihypertensive medication may put her at risk for hypertension, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.
7. Diabetes: The patient's history of diabetes and current lack of antidiabetic medication may put her at risk for hyperglycemia, which can lead to ketoacidosis, coma, and death.
8. VAP: The patient's prolonged use of antibiotics and mechanical ventilation may put her at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 54 year old female with DM, OSA, Asthma , with large
   ovarian mass now s/p ex-lap and panniculectomy, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   post-operative hypoxemia, now with acute renal failure likely [**2-4**] ATN
   from hypoperfusion during operation.
   1. ATN
 Patient now on HD, underwent first session on [**11-12**] with
   removal of 2 liters.
   --Will likely undergo 2^nd HD today
   --Appreciate renal recs
   --IVF only as needed for hypotension
   --monitor UOP and renal function
   2. Hypoxemia/PNA
 Patient remains extubated, although she has a
   persistent O2 requirement.  Has also been hypercarbic, and this has
   been exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night.
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn /Cipro for coverage of VAP (on day 4 of 8 day
   course, last day [**11-16**])

   ~1 wk.  Likely ileus post-surgically.
   --continue NGT on suction, NPO
   -- ct bowel regimen
   -- add Miralax
   4. s/p TAH-BSO for ovarian mass - Patient still having significant
   amount of pain, but also quite sedated.
   - d/c morphine PCA and start Dilaudid PRN (pt very drowsy on this but
   pain better controlled)
   - Zofran and Compazine for nausea/vomiting
   - apprec. gyn/onc recs
   - follow up pathology

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old female, is a post-operative patient with a large ovarian mass, admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during surgery. The patient is currently on hemodialysis, and the plan is to continue HD and monitor renal function. The patient remains extubated and has a persistent O2 requirement, with hypercarbic issues exacerbated by refusing to use CPAP at night. The patient has not had a bowel movement since prior to surgery, likely due to post-surgical ileus, and is experiencing significant pain despite being sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ATN: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during surgery. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypoxemia/PNA: The patient's persistent O2 requirement and hypercarbic issues may lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
3. Ileus: The patient's failure to pass stool since surgery may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation. Close monitoring of bowel function and regular bowel regimen is necessary to prevent complications.
4. Pain management: The patient's significant pain despite sedation may lead to inadequate pain management, which can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
5. Infection: The patient's history of VAP and ongoing antibiotic therapy may lead to antibiotic resistance and increased risk of infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct may mask underlying anemia, which can worsen with continued bleeding or inadequate transfusion.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes and current sliding scale insulin therapy may lead to hyperglycemia, which can worsen cardiovascular and respiratory complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current hold on anti-hypertensives may lead to uncontrolled hypertension, which can exacerbate cardiovascular and renal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of renal function, urine output, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue hemodialysis and monitor for signs of worsening renal function.
3. Implement a regular bowel regimen to promote bowel movement and prevent complications.
4. Optimize pain management with a combination of analgesics and non-pharmacological interventions.
5. Continue antibiotic therapy for VAP and monitor for signs of infection.
6. Monitor Hct and transfuse as necessary to prevent anemia.
7. Adjust insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia and prevent hyperglycemia.
8. Re-start anti-hypertensives as necessary to control hypertension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes, obesity, asthma, and ovarian mass, who underwent ex-lap and panniculectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypoxemia and acute renal failure likely due to ATN from hypoperfusion during operation. The patient is currently on hemodialysis, with the first session completed on 11/12, and is expected to undergo a second session today. She remains extubated, with improved respiratory status, and is being treated for hypoxemia and pneumonia. The patient has not had a bowel movement since prior to operation and is likely experiencing ileus post-surgically. She is still experiencing significant pain, but is also sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ATN: The patient is at risk for further ATN due to continued hypoperfusion, which can lead to worsening renal function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypoxemia/PNA: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she is at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Ileus: The patient's lack of bowel movement since prior to operation increases the risk of complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and abscess formation.
4. Pain management: The patient's significant pain, combined with her sedation, increases the risk of respiratory depression and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct level may not reflect the underlying anemia, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Infection: The patient's presence of NGT, JP drains, and wound care increases the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of pneumonia and ileus.
7. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a negative balance of 1,011 mL over the past 24 hours, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypertension and hypotension increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, particularly in the setting of ATN and anemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue hemodialysis and monitor renal function closely.
2. Maintain respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
3. Manage pain effectively, taking into account the patient's sedation and respiratory status.
4. Continue to monitor for signs of infection and take prompt action if suspected.
5. Closely monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
6. Consider adjusting anti-hypertensive medications based on the patient's blood pressure.
7. Monitor for signs of cardiovascular instability and take prompt action if suspected."
