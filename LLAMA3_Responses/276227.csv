You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hematocrit (Hct) has decreased significantly, requiring transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.
* The patient is being treated for fever, WBC, and UTI with meropenem.
* The patient has a history of allergies to Keflex, Ciprofloxacin, and Ertapenem, which may impact future antibiotic choices.
* Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/83 mmHg.
* The patient has a sinus tachycardia and a systolic murmur on cardiovascular examination.
* Respiratory support is not required, with an SpO2 of 96% and an ABG of //22/.
* The patient has diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally and is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube.
* The patient has a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, distended, and obese with ascites and diffuse tenderness.
* The patient has diffuse ecchymoses on the skin and is not assessed for extremities, neurologic, or eyes/conjunctiva.
* Laboratory results show anemia, liver function abnormalities, and hepatorenal syndrome.
* The patient has a diagnosis of thyroid cancer, malignant neoplasm, and is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding or transfusion-related complications
* Infection or sepsis due to UTI or other sources
* Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory status
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to sinus tachycardia and systolic murmur
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to ascites and distended abdomen
* Neurological compromise or seizures due to anemia, liver function abnormalities, and hepatorenal syndrome
* Kidney injury or failure due to hepatorenal syndrome
* Increased risk of thrombosis or embolism due to liver failure and prolonged INR
* Infection or sepsis due to liver failure and compromised immune system
* Poor wound healing or increased risk of surgical complications due to malnutrition and liver failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with
   refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome transfered to MICU for
   multifactorial and unexplained Hct drop and fever, likely secondary to
   trauma from recent paracentesis.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Patient noted to have falling Hct since [**12-23**] after
   getting a therapeutic paracentis in LLQ on that day.  CT abd/pelvis
   shows blood in ascitic fluid and LLQ abomdinal wall hematoma in patient
   with significant hepatic coagulopathy and worsening abdominal
   tenderness and distension over the past 24 hours.  She has not bumped
   appropriately with 3 units of PRBCs. Patient noted to have rising T.
   bili and low haptoglobin, though normal AST, ALT and LDH which argue
   against hemolysis (secondary to ?zosyn, macrobid).  Concern for DIC
   given new fever, though rare shistocytes seen on peripheral smear and
   low fibrinogen of unclear significance in patient with liver failure.
   EGD on [**7-17**] showed portal gastropathy but no history of significant GI
   bleed in recent days.  Noted to have ecchymosis covering her body.
   Suspect that patient has hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due
   to hepatic coagulopathy.
   - transfuse cryo to keep fibrinogen > 80
   - transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP x 2 to keep INR > 2
   - Vitamin K PO 10 x 1
   - keep platelets > 50
   - q 6 hour Hcts, coags, platelets, DIC labs
   - gauic stool
   - apreciate heme recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] in case of element of GI bleed
   - consider repeat CT abd/pelvis if Hct does not respond to blood
   transfusions
   .
   2.  Fever.  Patient noted to have new fever to 101.4 in setting of
   being on Zosyn for UTI after being afebrile for > 1 week.  Given
   concern that zosyn was causing hemolysis, this was stopped and patient
   was switched to levaquin.  CXR could not rule out PNA though no
   symptoms of pneumonia.  Para negative for SBP on [**2185-12-23**].   Will avoid
   repeat tap at present given trauma secondary to previous para.  Blood
   cultures NGTD at present.  Patient noted to have numerous skin
   breakdowns/ecchymosis.  PICC in place without evidence of infection.
   Of note, WBC has been rising for two days.  Of note, patient has a
   history of resistant infection; VRE bacteremia on [**11-16**] treated with
   dapto completed [**2185-12-2**]; ESBL E. coli UTI on [**12-10**] treated with 3 days
   of bactrim.
   - switch to meropenem for UTI therapy and monitor patient given history
   of allergy (rash) to ertapenem (discussed with ID fellow)
   - Follow fever, wbc
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  WBC has been rising for two days.  Known UTI on
   appropriate antibiotics for two days.  However, prior ESBL E. coli from
   two weeks ago was treated with only three days of bactrim.  CXR cannot
   rule out PNA, though low clinical suspician.  Hold off on repeat para
   due to concern for prior trauma.
   - f/u ua and culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   4. Tachypnea.  Fount to be tachypneic in setting of significant
   abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.  Have
   been holding lasix throughout hospital stay.  However, satting 98% on
   RA.
   - lasix prn sob
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  HR had been in 70s-80s until [**12-23**] when Hct began to
   fall.  HR has been steadily rising sicne [**12-23**], now 100-130.  Likely
   secondary to anemia and abomdinal pain.
   - check EKG
   - transfuse blood
   .
   6.  Cirrhosis/ ESLD.  Patient is s/p TIPS [**10-17**] admitted initially for
   refractory ascites.  She underwent therapeutic tap 2 days ago ([**12-23**])
   which showed no evidence of SBP. Awaiting liver transplant, although
   need workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to trasplant.
   - continue lactulose
   - continue rifaxamin
   - lasix 40iv prn volume overload in setting of significant blood
   product transfusions
   .
   7.  Confusion.  Patient noted to be more confused over the past few
   days.  Triggered on [**12-23**] for confusion so lactulose was increased.  No
   evidence of asterixis at present.  Likely multifactorial etiology of
   confusion secondary to abdominal pain, anemia, fever, ?infection, and
   hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
   - follow fever/wbc
   - continue lactulose
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   8. ARF.  Patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks.  Urine sodium
   on [**12-10**] noted to be less than 2.  Has UTI at present, being treated
   with Levaquin.
   - U/A, urine lytes

   9. Papillary Thyroid Cancer. ***Patient currently UNAWARE of this
   diagnosis.**** While undergoing workup for hypercalcemia, patient found
   to have thryoid nodule.  Biopsy postiive for papillary carcinoma.
   Awaiting evaluation from surgery to determine if surgical resection is
   curable.  Liver transplant on hold pending malignancy workup/treatment.
   - surgery recs
   - liver team to inform patient of malignancy
   .
   10.  Hypercalcemia. Patient being followed by renal and endocrine for
   primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Had low 24 hour urine
   calcium.
   - continue to monitor calcium
   .
   11. Psoriasis.  Evaluated by dermatology who feels skin findings are
   consistent with patient's known history of psoraisis.  However, drug
   reaction remains in differential which could support zosyn-induced
   hemolysis diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis, refractory ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome who was transferred to the MICU for an unexplained Hct drop and fever.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Anemia: The patient has a falling Hct since December 23rd, which is concerning for hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due to hepatic coagulopathy.
2. Fever: The patient has a new fever to 101.4°F, which is likely secondary to UTI, and the patient was switched to meropenem therapy.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC has been rising for two days, and the patient has a known UTI on appropriate antibiotics.
4. Tachypnea: The patient is tachypneic due to significant abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's HR has been steadily rising since December 23rd, likely secondary to anemia and abdominal pain.
6. Cirrhosis/ESLD: The patient has cirrhosis and is awaiting liver transplant, although the need for workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to transplant is pending.
7. Confusion: The patient is more confused over the past few days, likely due to multifactorial etiology including abdominal pain, anemia, fever, and hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
8. ARF: The patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks and has a UTI at present, being treated with Levaquin.
9. Papillary Thyroid Cancer: The patient was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma, and liver transplant is on hold pending malignancy workup/treatment.
10. Hypercalcemia: The patient is being followed by renal and endocrine for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemoperitoneum: The patient's falling Hct and rising T. bili suggest hemoperitoneum, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.
2. DIC: The patient's low fibrinogen and new fever suggest DIC, which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in patients with liver failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's rising WBC and new fever suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
4. Infection: The patient's history of resistant infections and current UTI therapy suggest the possibility of infection, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
5. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites suggest liver failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and tachycardia suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.
7. Cardiovascular failure: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiovascular failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including hemoperitoneum, DIC, pneumonia, infection, liver failure, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular failure. Prompt recognition and management of these complications are crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with
   refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome transfered to MICU for
   unexplained Hct drop, likely secondary to trauma from recent
   paracentesis.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Patient noted to have falling Hct since [**12-23**] after
   getting a therapeutic paracentis in LLQ on that day.  CT abd/pelvis
   shows blood in ascitic fluid and LLQ abomdinal wall hematoma in patient
   with significant hepatic coagulopathy and worsening abdominal
   tenderness and distension over the past 24 hours.  She has not bumped
   appropriately with 3 units of PRBCs. Patient noted to have rising T.
   bili and low haptoglobin, though normal AST, ALT and LDH which argue
   against hemolysis (secondary to ?zosyn, macrobid). Low haptoglobin may
   be due to hepatic impairment.  Concern for DIC given new fever, though
   rare shistocytes seen on peripheral smear and low fibrinogen of unclear
   significance in patient with liver failure.  EGD on [**7-17**] showed portal
   gastropathy but no history of significant GI bleed in recent days.
   Noted to have ecchymosis covering her body.  Suspect that patient has
   hemoperitoneum secondary to paracentesis due to hepatic coagulopathy.
   - transfuse cryo to keep fibrinogen > 80
   - transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct > 25
   - FFP x 2 to keep INR < 2
   - keep platelets > 50
   - q 6 hour Hcts, coags, platelets, DIC labs
   - gauic stool
   - apreciate heme recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] in case of element of GI bleed
   - consider repeat CT abd/pelvis if Hct does not respond to blood
   transfusions
   - consider surgery consult if unable to stabilize bleed with reversal
   of coagulapathy and blood product supports
   .
   2.  Fever.  Patient noted to have new fever to 101.4 on [**12-25**] in
   setting of being on Zosyn for UTI after being afebrile for > 1 week.
   Given concern that zosyn was causing hemolysis, this was stopped and
   patient was switched to levaquin.  CXR could not rule out PNA though no
   symptoms of pneumonia.  Para negative for SBP on [**2185-12-23**].   Will avoid
   repeat tap at present given trauma secondary to previous para.  Blood
   cultures NGTD at present.  Patient noted to have numerous skin
   breakdowns/ecchymosis.  PICC in place without evidence of infection.
   Of note, WBC has been rising for two days.  Of note, patient has a
   history of resistant infection; VRE bacteremia on [**11-16**] treated with
   dapto completed [**2185-12-2**]; ESBL E. coli UTI on [**12-10**] treated with 3 days
   of bactrim.
   - switch to meropenem for UTI therapy and monitor patient given history
   of allergy (rash) to ertapenem (discussed with ID fellow)
   - Follow fever, wbc
   - consider empiric linezolid given VRE history if patient decompensates
   to cover line infection
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  WBC has been rising for two days.  Known UTI on
   appropriate antibiotics for two days.  However, prior ESBL E. coli from
   two weeks ago was treated with only three days of bactrim.  CXR cannot
   rule out PNA, though low clinical suspician.  Hold off on repeat para
   due to concern for prior trauma.
   - f/u ua and culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   4. Tachypnea.  Fount to be tachypneic in setting of significant
   abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.  Have
   been holding lasix throughout hospital stay.  However, satting 98% on
   RA.   Woresening CHF on CXR today, though appears comfortable and on
   room air.
   - lasix prn sob
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  HR had been in 70s-80s until [**12-23**] when Hct began to
   fall.  HR has been steadily rising sicne [**12-23**], now 100-130.  Likely
   secondary to anemia and abomdinal pain.
   - check EKG
   - transfuse blood
   .
   6.  Cirrhosis/ ESLD.  Patient is s/p TIPS [**10-17**] admitted initially for
   refractory ascites.  She underwent therapeutic tap 2 days ago ([**12-23**])
   which showed no evidence of SBP. Awaiting liver transplant, although
   need workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to trasplant.
   - continue lactulose
   - discuss with liver why not on rifaxamin
   - lasix 40iv prn volume overload in setting of significant blood
   product transfusions
   .
   7.  Confusion.  Patient noted to be more confused over the past few
   days.  Triggered on [**12-23**] for confusion so lactulose was increased.  No
   evidence of asterixis at present.  Likely multifactorial etiology of
   confusion secondary to abdominal pain, anemia, fever, ?infection, and
   hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
   - follow fever/wbc
   - continue lactulose
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   8. ARF.  Patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks.  Urine sodium
   on [**12-10**] noted to be less than 2.  Has UTI at present, being treated
   with Levaquin.
   - U/A, urine lytes
   - monitor I/O
   - octreotide 100 mg SC TID
   - midodrine 7.5 mg TID
   - discuss with liver if albumin 25g [**Hospital1 7**] can be stopped due to
   significant blood product transfusions
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   9. Papillary Thyroid Cancer. ***Patient currently UNAWARE of this
   diagnosis.**** While undergoing workup for hypercalcemia, patient found
   to have thryoid nodule.  Biopsy postiive for papillary carcinoma.
   Awaiting evaluation from surgery to determine if surgical resection is
   curable.  Liver transplant on hold pending malignancy workup/treatment.
   - surgery recs
   - liver team to inform patient of malignancy
   .
   10.  Hypercalcemia. Patient being followed by renal and endocrine for
   primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Had low 24 hour urine
   calcium.
   - continue to monitor calcium
   .
   11. Psoriasis.  Evaluated by dermatology who feels skin findings are
   consistent with patient's known history of psoraisis.  However, drug
   reaction remains in differential which could support zosyn-induced
   hemolysis diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   of coagulapathy and blood product supports
   .
   2.  Fever.  Patient noted to have new fever to 101.4 on [**12-25**] in
   setting of being on Zosyn for UTI after being afebrile for > 1 week.
   Given concern that zosyn was causing hemolysis, this was stopped and
   patient was switched to levaquin.  CXR could not rule out PNA though no
   symptoms of pneumonia.  Para negative for SBP on [**2185-12-23**].   Will avoid
   repeat tap at present given trauma secondary to previous para.  Blood
   cultures NGTD at present.  Patient noted to have numerous skin
   breakdowns/ecchymosis.  PICC in place without evidence of infection.
   Of note, WBC has been rising for two days.  Of note, patient has a
   history of resistant infection; VRE bacteremia on [**11-16**] treated with
   dapto completed [**2185-12-2**]; ESBL E. coli UTI on [**12-10**] treated with 3 days
   of bactrim.
   - switch to meropenem for UTI therapy and monitor patient given history
   of allergy (rash) to ertapenem (discussed with ID fellow)
   - Follow fever, wbc
   - consider empiric linezolid given VRE history if patient decompensates
   to cover line infection
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  WBC has been rising for two days.  Known UTI on
   appropriate antibiotics for two days.  However, prior ESBL E. coli from
   two weeks ago was treated with only three days of bactrim.  CXR cannot
   rule out PNA, though low clinical suspician.  Hold off on repeat para
   due to concern for prior trauma.

   4. Tachypnea.  Fount to be tachypneic in setting of significant
   abdominal ascites and after receiving 3 units of blood today.  Have
   been holding lasix throughout hospital stay.  However, satting 98% on
   RA.   Woresening CHF on CXR today, though appears comfortable and on
   room air.

   5.  Tachycardia.  HR had been in 70s-80s until [**12-23**] when Hct began to
   fall.  HR has been steadily rising sicne [**12-23**], now 100-130.  Likely
   secondary to anemia and abomdinal pain.
   - check EKG
   - transfuse blood
   .
   6.  Cirrhosis/ ESLD.  Patient is s/p TIPS [**10-17**] admitted initially for
   refractory ascites.  She underwent therapeutic tap 2 days ago ([**12-23**])
   which showed no evidence of SBP. Awaiting liver transplant, although
   need workup for newly diagnosed thyroid malignancy prior to trasplant.
   - continue lactulose
   - discuss with liver why not on rifaxamin
   - lasix 40iv prn volume overload in setting of significant blood

   7.  Confusion.  Patient noted to be more confused over the past few
   days.  Triggered on [**12-23**] for confusion so lactulose was increased.  No
   evidence of asterixis at present.  Likely multifactorial etiology of
   confusion secondary to abdominal pain, anemia, fever, ?infection, and
   hepatic failure/encephalopathy.
   - follow fever/wbc
   - continue lactulose
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   8. ARF.  Patient has been treated for HRS for >2 weeks.  Urine sodium

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with recurrent ascites and
   recent HRS who was admitted to MICU with a drop in HCT which is at
   least in part due to a recent paracentesis [**12-23**] with  intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor.
   Hypotension / Hct Drop: at least in part explained by intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage in the setting of elevated INR and paracentesis attempt. She
   has received in total 4UPRBC and 1 UFFP since [**12-23**]. There may also be
   an element of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin and low haptogloibin
   but normal LDH  Notably she has no varices on EGD in [**8-/2185**] and no
   evidence of bleeding from above or below (grossly) but she is heme
   positive in stool  .  We will work to actively reverse her INR to
   prevent further bleeding. Perhaps there is an element of hemolysis (?
   Relation to Pip-tazo) and we have changed Abx.  DIC seems less likely
   based on low D-dimer, her fibrinogen is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of her liver disease.
   - Hct > 25, INR < 2.0 (if possible), PLt>50
   -Vit K
   - Follow DIC labs
   Fever: has a Klebsiella UTI (from [**12-23**]), notably she has had a ESBL
   Kleb in the past.  Notably the paracentesis on [**12-23**] was neg for
   infection (by WBC and clx).  She also has a PICC line but clx have
   remained neg. Will cont meropenem for now (despite ertapenem allergy,
   ok per ID). We will defer additional paracentesis, but if she spikes a
   fever we may need to re-consider. Antibiotics choices are complicated
   in this patient given her multiple allergies.
   - Cont Meropenem. If spikes wll need to add gram pos coverage (has a hx
   of VRE)
   - Follow up blood clx and urine clx.
   Ascites/Liver failure underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver
   failure. We will cont the
   - cont lactulose. Will ask liver service why she is not on rifax.
   - defer lasix given hemodynamic instability
   Renal failure: her new chronic base line appears to be near 2.8 with a
   known recent hx of HRS (s/p treatment with midodrine)
   - cont octreotide and midodrine with high dose albumin. We may be able
   to defer the albumin in the setting of her transfusions.
   Eosinophilia: unclear etiology it has been present since the end of
   [**Month (only) 1148**]. It does not appear to be related to medication although this
   would be the concern in the setting of her fevers (no rash). The
   broader differential includes papillary thyroid cancer .
   Papillary carcinoma: deferring additional work up at this point, she
   may be a surgical candidate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with recurrent ascites and
   recent HRS who was admitted to MICU with a drop in HCT which is at
   least in part due to a recent paracentesis [**12-23**] with  intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor.
   Hypotension / Hct Drop: at least in part explained by intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage in the setting of elevated INR and paracentesis attempt. She
   has received in total 4UPRBC and 1 UFFP since [**12-23**]. There may also be
   an element of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin and low haptogloibin
   but normal LDH  Notably she has no varices on EGD in [**8-/2185**] and no
   evidence of bleeding from above or below (grossly) but she is heme
   positive in stool  .  We will work to actively reverse her INR to
   prevent further bleeding. Perhaps there is an element of hemolysis (?
   Relation to Pip-tazo) and we have changed Abx.  DIC seems less likely
   based on low D-dimer, her fibrinogen is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of her liver disease.
   - Hct > 25, INR < 2.0 (if possible), PLt>50
   -Vit K
   - Follow DIC labs
   Fever: has a Klebsiella UTI (from [**12-23**]), notably she has had a ESBL
   Kleb in the past.  Notably the paracentesis on [**12-23**] was neg for
   infection (by WBC and clx).  She also has a PICC line but clx have
   remained neg. Will cont meropenem for now (despite ertapenem allergy,
   ok per ID). We will defer additional paracentesis, but if she spikes a
   fever we may need to re-consider. Antibiotics choices are complicated
   in this patient given her multiple allergies.
   - Cont Meropenem. If spikes wll need to add gram pos coverage (has a hx
   of VRE)
   - Follow up blood clx and urine clx.
   Ascites/Liver failure underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver
   failure. We will cont the
   - cont lactulose. Will ask liver service why she is not on rifax.
   - defer lasix given hemodynamic instability
   Renal failure: her new chronic base line appears to be near 2.8 with a
   known recent hx of HRS (s/p treatment with midodrine)
   - cont octreotide and midodrine with high dose albumin. We may be able
   to defer the albumin in the setting of her transfusions.
   Eosinophilia: unclear etiology it has been present since the end of
   [**Month (only) 1148**]. It does not appear to be related to medication although this
   would be the concern in the setting of her fevers (no rash). The
   broader differential includes papillary thyroid cancer .
   Papillary carcinoma: deferring additional work up at this point, she
   may be a surgical candidate.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, and recent hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) who was admitted to the MICU with a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm (99-120 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/83 mmHg (92-148/90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (19-30)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Anxious general appearance
* Icteric sclera
* Normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat
* Cervical lymph nodes within normal limits
* Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 heart sound, and a systolic murmur
* Respiratory examination reveals dullness and crackles in the bilateral bases
* Abdominal examination reveals a soft, bowel sounds present, distended abdomen with large ascites
* Extremities are 2+ bilaterally
* Skin examination reveals warm skin with diffuse ecchymosis and hemorrhagic bullae over the left thumb
* Neurological examination reveals a patient who responds to verbal stimuli, has purposeful movement, and normal tone

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 119 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Bilirubin: 164 mg/dL
* Alkaline phosphatase: 37 IU/L
* Total protein: 4.4 g/dL
* Albumin: 4.4 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase: 165 IU/L
* Calcium: 10.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.0 mg/dL

Imaging studies reveal:

* CXR: small lung volumes, perihilar fullness, PICC and NG in place
* CT ABD/Pelvis: pending

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension and HCT drop: likely due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage, elevated INR, and paracentesis attempt
* Hemolysis: possible, but not definitively confirmed
* DIC: unlikely based on low D-dimer and fibrinogen levels
* INR reversal: attempted to prevent further bleeding
* Fever: likely due to Klebsiella UTI, with a possible element of hemolysis
* Antibiotics: meropenem continued, with possible addition of gram-positive coverage
* Ascites/Liver failure: underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver failure, lactulose continued
* Renal failure: chronic baseline near 2.8, with possible deferral of albumin
* Eosinophilia: unclear etiology, possible papillary thyroid cancer, deferring additional workup
* Other issues: persistent intra-abdominal bleeding, increasing abdominal girth, and concern for persistent bleeding

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 25 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: PICC line and 20-gauge IV line
* Prophylaxis: DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP precautions
* Comments: communication, code status, and disposition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, and recent hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She was admitted to the MICU with a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) due to a recent paracentesis with hemorrhage. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through a PICC line, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications. The drop in HCT is a significant concern, and the patient is at risk for further bleeding. The presence of ascites and liver failure increases the risk of infection and worsens the patient's overall prognosis. The eosinophilia may indicate an allergic reaction to one of the medications or an underlying inflammatory process.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's recent paracentesis with hemorrhage increases the risk of further bleeding, particularly with the presence of ascites and liver failure.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ascites make her prone to infection, which can be exacerbated by the presence of a central line.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may progress to hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and even death.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's HRS may progress to renal failure, which can further worsen her prognosis.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if her ascites worsens.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to absorb nutrients due to her liver disease and ascites may lead to malnutrition and further compromise her immune function.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's liver failure may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not addressed promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
2. Implement infection control measures, including proper hand hygiene, to reduce the risk of infection.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her medications as needed to prevent further liver damage.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly to prevent further renal deterioration.
5. Consider adding respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation, to optimize the patient's respiratory status.
6. Ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition and consider adding supplements to address any nutritional deficiencies.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis with recurrent ascites and
   recent HRS who was admitted to MICU with a drop in HCT which is at
   least in part due to a recent paracentesis [**12-23**] with  intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor.
   Hypotension / Hct Drop: at least in part explained by intra-abdominal
   hemorrhage in the setting of elevated INR and paracentesis attempt. She
   has received in total 4UPRBC and 1 UFFP since [**12-23**]. There may also be
   an element of hemolysis with increasing bilirubin and low haptogloibin
   but normal LDH  Notably she has no varices on EGD in [**8-/2185**] and no
   evidence of bleeding from above or below (grossly) but she is heme
   positive in stool  .  We will work to actively reverse her INR to
   prevent further bleeding. Perhaps there is an element of hemolysis (?
   Relation to Pip-tazo) and we have changed Abx.  DIC seems less likely
   based on low D-dimer, her fibrinogen is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of her liver disease.
   - Hct > 25, INR < 2.0 (if possible), PLt>50
   -Vit K
   - Follow DIC labs
   Fever: has a Klebsiella UTI (from [**12-23**]), notably she has had a ESBL
   Kleb in the past.  Notably the paracentesis on [**12-23**] was neg for
   infection (by WBC and clx).  She also has a PICC line but clx have
   remained neg. Will cont meropenem for now (despite ertapenem allergy,
   ok per ID). We will defer additional paracentesis, but if she spikes a
   fever we may need to re-consider. Antibiotics choices are complicated
   in this patient given her multiple allergies.
   - Cont Meropenem. If spikes wll need to add gram pos coverage (has a hx
   of VRE)
   - Follow up blood clx and urine clx.
   Ascites/Liver failure underlying Hep C/MTX with progressive liver
   failure. We will cont the
   - cont lactulose. Will ask liver service why she is not on rifax.
   - defer lasix given hemodynamic instability
   Renal failure: her new chronic base line appears to be near 2.8 with a
   known recent hx of HRS (s/p treatment with midodrine)
   - cont octreotide and midodrine with high dose albumin. We may be able
   to defer the albumin in the setting of her transfusions.
   Eosinophilia: unclear etiology it has been present since the end of
   [**Month (only) 1148**]. It does not appear to be related to medication although this
   would be the concern in the setting of her fevers (no rash). The
   broader differential includes papillary thyroid cancer .
   Papillary carcinoma: deferring additional work up at this point, she
   may be a surgical candidate.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with HCV/MTX cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, and recent hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She was admitted to the MICU with a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and failure to respond to transfusions on the floor. She has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since admission. The patient has a PICC line, and her laboratory results show an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), bilirubin, and low haptoglobin, but normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient has a history of recurrent ascites, and her liver function is deteriorating. She has been treated with lactulose, but her ascites is not responding. She also has renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, and has been treated with octreotide and midodrine. The patient has an eosinophilia, which is unclear in etiology, and is being monitored for papillary thyroid cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's INR is elevated, which increases the risk of bleeding. Her liver function is deteriorating, which may exacerbate bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a Klebsiella UTI and a PICC line, which increases the risk of infection. She also has a history of ESBL Kleb in the past.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, which may lead to further liver failure and decreased synthetic function.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate worsening renal failure.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia is unclear in etiology, but it may be related to her underlying liver disease or a medication reaction.
