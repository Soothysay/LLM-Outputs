You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient underwent a pre-AVR cath and was cleared for CABG surgery on [**8-14**]. The plan is to discharge the patient on [**8-10**] at noon with plans to return on [**8-14**] at 6AM. The patient is stable, with no complaints, and is expected to recover well.

However, the patient has developed pulmonary edema and aortic stenosis, which may complicate their recovery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 135/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary edema and aortic stenosis may increase their risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's aortic stenosis may increase their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's pulmonary edema and aortic stenosis may increase their risk of developing sepsis, particularly if they develop a secondary infection.
5. Renal failure: The patient's aortic stenosis may increase their risk of developing renal failure, particularly if they have pre-existing kidney disease.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may indicate inflammation or tissue damage. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but their calcium and magnesium levels are slightly elevated. The patient's albumin level is slightly decreased, which may indicate malnutrition or liver disease.

The patient's medications include atorvastatin, which may need to be adjusted based on their laboratory results. The patient's prophylactic medications include anticoagulation therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis."

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch tall, 64 kg male who underwent a pre-AVR catheterization that demonstrated clean arteries and critical AS. He is scheduled for CABG on [**8-14**] and is expected to be discharged on [**8-10**] at noon with plans to return on [**8-14**] at 6AM. The patient is stable, with no complaints, and is currently receiving ICU care.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His hemodynamic monitoring is stable, with a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m².

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 42 IU/L and AST of 28 IU/L. His renal function is normal, with a BUN of 26 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is a potential complication of his critical AS and may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's critical AS may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98% may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL and platelet count of 199 K/uL may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL may indicate early signs of renal failure, which could worsen if not managed properly.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's mildly elevated liver function tests may indicate early signs of hepatic dysfunction, which could worsen if not managed properly.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count of 199 K/uL may increase his risk of bleeding complications during and after surgery."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 CRITICAL AORTIC STENOSIS
   This is an 80 year old male with a history of critical AS (peak
   velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) **] .8 cm2) presenting with
   acute onset of shortness of breath this morning consistent with CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Likely secondary to congestive heart failure as
   patient has signs of fluid overload on imaging and BNP=7739.  Patient
   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room
   air after diuresis.  Differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE,
   and pneumonia.  PE has been ruled out after negative CTA.  Pneumonia
   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without prodromal syptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe
   aortic stenosis (albeit with a normal EF and adequate pulse pressure),
   so a small insult could throw him into failure.  Ischemia is on the
   differential, but no CP or EKG changes.  He does have evidence of
   infection that may have tipped him over.
   - Blood cultures and urine culture pending
   - f/u final read of chest CTA
   - Continue diuresis.  Patient is Lasix naive and put out 3.5 Liters
   after single dose of Lasix 40mg IV.
   - Pt received one dose of vanco IV in the ED which was not continued
   after arrival to the CCU as patient does not look clinically infected.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Patient has critical AS by Echo in [**6-28**], but has
   never had syncope, angina, or CHF in the past.  Will consult CT surgery
   to begin work-up for potential AVR.
   - Elective cath today to r/o coronary disease prior to AVR, NPO after
   midnight.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  He has no history of CAD or prior MI.  He will need to
   have a cardiac cath tomorrow prior to proceeding for AVR.
   -CEs negative on admission
   -If there are no signs of CAD on cath, patient would most likely prefer
   to have percutaneous AVR.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient is on amlodipine 5mg/benazepril 20mg daily as
   well as triamterene 37.5mg/HCTZ 25mg daily at home.  His blood pressure
   has been running in the 90s to 110s since admission secondary to the
   Lasix and all blood pressure meds will be held.  His BP will be
   monitored closely.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose of simvastatin 40mg.
   .
   # Spinal stenosis: Continue home pain regimen of celebrex 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   FEN: Heart healthy/low sodium diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 CRITICAL AORTIC STENOSIS
   This is an 80 year old male with a history of critical AS (peak
   velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) **] .8 cm2) presenting with
   acute onset of shortness of breath this morning consistent with CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Likely secondary to congestive heart failure as
   patient has signs of fluid overload on imaging and BNP=7739.  Patient
   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room
   air after diuresis.  Differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE,
   and pneumonia.  PE has been ruled out after negative CTA.  Pneumonia
   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without prodromal syptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe
   aortic stenosis (albeit with a normal EF and adequate pulse pressure),
   so a small insult could throw him into failure.  Ischemia is on the
   differential, but no CP or EKG changes.  He does have evidence of
   infection that may have tipped him over.
   - Blood cultures and urine culture pending
   - f/u final read of chest CTA
   - Continue diuresis.  Patient is Lasix naive and put out 3.5 Liters
   after single dose of Lasix 40mg IV.
   - Pt received one dose of vanco IV in the ED which was not continued
   after arrival to the CCU as patient does not look clinically infected.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Patient has critical AS by Echo in [**6-28**], but has
   never had syncope, angina, or CHF in the past.  Will consult CT surgery
   to begin work-up for potential AVR.
   - Elective cath today to r/o coronary disease prior to AVR, NPO after
   midnight.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  He has no history of CAD or prior MI.  He will need to
   have a cardiac cath tomorrow prior to proceeding for AVR.
   -CEs negative on admission
   -If there are no signs of CAD on cath, patient would most likely prefer
   to have percutaneous AVR.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient is on amlodipine 5mg/benazepril 20mg daily as
   well as triamterene 37.5mg/HCTZ 25mg daily at home.  His blood pressure

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS) who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of shortness of breath and signs of fluid overload. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has undergone a pre-AVR catheterization that demonstrated clean arteries and critical AS. He is scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization tomorrow to rule out coronary disease prior to aortic valve replacement (AVR).

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 135/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination is notable for crackles in the lungs bilaterally and 1+ edema in the extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, a normal white blood cell count, and a mild elevation in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may lead to further cardiac compromise, including cardiogenic shock, if not managed effectively.
3. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's critical AS and need for AVR may lead to complications during the procedure, including bleeding, infection, and cardiac tamponade.
4. Coronary Disease: The patient's coronary disease, if present, may not be adequately addressed during the AVR procedure, leading to further cardiac complications.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and unexplained lung opacity on CT may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's mild elevation in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen may indicate early signs of renal compromise, which could worsen if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, particularly in the setting of CHF and critical AS, may lead to further cardiac compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute onset of shortness of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation. He has critical aortic stenosis (peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, 0.8 cm2) and clean coronaries. He was stabilized with diuresis and oxygen therapy. The patient has no history of CAD or prior MI, and coronary catheterization showed no flow-limiting CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's condition can worsen due to fluid overload, which may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's critical AS may lead to cardiac failure, and the planned AVR procedure may not be effective if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been running in the 90s to 110s, and if not managed properly, may lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiovascular complications.
5. Spinal Stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis may exacerbate if not managed properly, leading to further pain and discomfort.
6. Infection: The patient's WBC count of 17.2 and unexplained lingular opacity on CT may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
7. Ischemia: The patient's critical AS may lead to ischemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, especially during the planned AVR procedure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, fluid balance, and respiratory function.
2. Optimize the patient's cardiac medications, including beta-blockers and diuretics, to manage his critical AS and fluid overload.
3. Consider further testing, such as echocardiography and cardiac MRI, to assess the patient's cardiac function and potential underlying causes of his symptoms.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
5. Monitor the patient's WBC count and consider further testing to rule out underlying infection.
6. Consider further management of the patient's spinal stenosis, including physical therapy and pain management.
7. Plan for the patient's discharge with instructions for home care and follow-up appointments.
8. Coordinate with the patient's primary care physician and cardiologist to ensure a smooth transition of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute onset of shortness of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation. He has critical aortic stenosis (peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, and aortic valve area 0.8 cm2) and clean coronaries. He has signs of fluid overload on imaging and a high BNP level of 7739. He required CPAP to maintain oxygen saturation in the ED, but was quickly weaned to room air after diuresis.

The patient has no history of CAD or prior MI, and his coronaries show no flow-limiting disease. He has mild luminal irregularities in the LAD, LCX, and RCA. He is planned for cardiac catheterization and potential AVR surgery.

The patient's medications include amlodipine, benazepril, triamterene, and HCTZ, which will be held. He will receive metoprolol 25mg PO BID and lisinopril 20mg PO daily. His pain regimen for spinal stenosis will continue with celebrex 200mg.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 17.2, which is unexplained. His other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath and signs of fluid overload on imaging suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and CHF exacerbation increase the risk of cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The patient's unexplained WBC count of 17.2 and ill-defined lingular opacity on CT suggest a possible infection.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's negative CTA rules out PE, but the risk of PE is still present.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's acute onset of shortness of breath and lack of prodromal symptoms make pneumonia a possible diagnosis.
6. Aortic valve rupture: The patient's critical aortic stenosis increases the risk of aortic valve rupture.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and CHF exacerbation increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Renal failure: The patient's fluid overload and CHF exacerbation increase the risk of renal failure.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 CRITICAL AORTIC STENOSIS
   This is an 80 year old male who presented with acute onset of shortness
   of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation, now s/p cardiac cath
   showing critical AS (peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) **]
   .8 cm2) and clean coronaries.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Likely secondary to congestive heart failure as
   patient has signs of fluid overload on imaging and BNP=7739.  Patient
   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room
   air after diuresis.  Differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE,
   and pneumonia.  PE has been ruled out after negative CTA.  Pneumonia
   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without pro-dromal symptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe
   aortic stenosis (albeit with a normal EF and adequate pulse pressure),
   so a small insult could throw him into failure.  Ischemia is on the
   differential, but no CP or EKG changes.
   - Blood cultures and urine culture NGTD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   nothing to add
   Physical Examination
   nothing to add
   Medical Decision Making
   nothing to add,
   discharge home today, start beta blocker
   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation. He has critical aortic stenosis (peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, and aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2) and clean coronaries. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and is being treated with diuresis and oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac failure, which can worsen his shortness of breath and reduce his cardiac output.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure, which can worsen his shortness of breath and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and unexplained lingular opacity on CT scan suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Ischemia: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can lead to ischemia, which can cause chest pain, arrhythmias, and even myocardial infarction.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's anticoagulation therapy for DVT prophylaxis can increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Cardiac catheterization to assess the severity of his aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
2. Aortic valve replacement surgery to treat his critical aortic stenosis.
3. Diuresis and oxygen therapy to manage his pulmonary edema.
4. Antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
5. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE.
6. Pain management to treat his spinal stenosis.
7. Discharge planning to ensure the patient's safe transfer to a cardiac rehabilitation program.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be discharged today with a plan to return for aortic valve replacement surgery."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 CRITICAL AORTIC STENOSIS
   This is an 80 year old male who presented with acute onset of shortness
   of breath consistent with CHF exacerbation, now s/p cardiac cath
   showing critical AS (peak velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) **]
   .8 cm2) and clean coronaries.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Likely secondary to congestive heart failure as
   patient has signs of fluid overload on imaging and BNP=7739.  Patient
   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room
   air after diuresis.  Differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE,
   and pneumonia.  PE has been ruled out after negative CTA.  Pneumonia
   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without pro-dromal symptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe
   aortic stenosis (albeit with a normal EF and adequate pulse pressure),
   so a small insult could throw him into failure.  Ischemia is on the
   differential, but no CP or EKG changes.
   - Blood cultures and urine culture NGTD
   - chest CTA without PE
   - diuresed well and has been oxygenating well on RA
   - Pt received one dose of vanco IV in the ED which was not continued
   after arrival to the CCU as patient does not look clinically infected.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Patient has critical AS by Echo in [**6-28**] and
   confirmed with cardiac cath yesterday, but has never had syncope,
   angina, or CHF in the past.  CT surgery to begin work-up for potential
   AVR.
   -Carotid U/S and CXR (PA/Lateral)- scheduled for today before
   discharge.
   - Planned procedure on Tuesday
   .
   # CORONARIES:  He has no history of CAD or prior MI.
   -CEs negative on admission
   - cath showing no flow limiting CAD, R dominant system, LMCA without
   obstructive disease LAD with mild luminal irregularities with a 20% mid
   vessel stenosis, LCX and RCA with mild luminal irregularities
   -If there are no signs of CAD on cath, patient would most likely prefer
   to have percutaneous AVR.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient is on amlodipine 5mg/benazepril 20mg daily as
   well as triamterene 37.5mg/HCTZ 25mg daily at home.  His blood pressure
   has been running in the 90s to 110s since admission secondary to the
   Lasix and all blood pressure meds will be held.
   -stopped amlodipine/benazepril
   -metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   -add lisinopril 20mg PO daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of critical aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated clean coronary arteries and critical AS.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 72 bpm
* Blood pressure: 135/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Blood glucose: 110 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for a harsh grade III systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. He has 1+ edema bilaterally and no signs of cardiac tamponade.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.6-11.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.3-12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 199-200 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.8-1.1 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and spinal stenosis. He has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or prior myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Blood cultures and urine culture to rule out sepsis
* Chest computed tomography angiogram (CTA) to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Diuresis with furosemide to manage CHF
* Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%
* Antibiotics to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Progression of CHF exacerbation
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure
* Cardiac tamponade or cardiac arrest
* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction

The patient is scheduled for cardiac surgery on [**8-14**] and will be discharged to home with plans to return for the procedure."
