 Inability to protect airway/aspiration risk: after taggered RBC scan,
   if no evidence for active bleeding, will wean propofol and switch to
   pressure support for rapid extuabtion.
 Massive bleed/ EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED): LIkely traumatic secondary to
   NG tube placement, in the setting of caogulopathy from cirrhosis and
   regular motrin use for pain. Now s/p balloon placement. Will follow up
   ENT recommendations. Nasal alae on the left appears edematous ? need to
   decreased pressure on the balloon. Will obtained tagged RBC scan given
   hct not responding per NeuroIR. Transfuse 2 more units of PRBC. Follow
   up hct q6hours. Will give more FFP, goal INR <1.5, will hold off on FFP
   now. plt >50. Fib >100
 Varices: possibly recently bled, still with large size varices
   despite TIPS. Will continue octroetide. Obtain formal ultrasoudn for
   TIPS evaluation. On Meropenem that covers for SBP prophylaxis
 Duodenal ulcer: s/p injection, not actively bleeding. decrease ppi to
   iv bid if ok with GI. Hold NSAIDs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a brisk upper bleed likely originating from the left nasal passage. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and the bleeding is attributed to coagulopathy and regular use of Motrin for pain. The patient has undergone endoscopy, and a balloon has been placed in the left nasal passage. The patient's hemoglobin level has not responded to transfusion, and further transfusion is planned. The patient is receiving octreotide for varices, and meropenem for suspected SBP prophylaxis. The patient's liver disease is being managed with TIPS, and a formal ultrasound is planned for TIPS evaluation. The patient is also being treated for duodenal ulcer and possible cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the nasal passage, which may lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock and respiratory failure.
2. Development of coagulopathy, which may worsen the patient's bleeding and increase the risk of thrombosis.
3. Infection, particularly pneumonia, due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
4. Sepsis, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices.
5. Respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
6. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices.
8. Renal failure, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices.
9. Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices.
10. Infection of the surgical site, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of varices."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues. The patient has a brisk upper bleed, likely originating from the left nasal passage, which was treated with balloon placement. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which may have contributed to the development of coagulopathy.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with acute respiratory failure due to an inability to protect their airway and aspiration risk. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic status is also unstable, with a heart rate of 129 bpm and blood pressure of 135/78 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 80 K/uL. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an INR of 18.1 and a PTT of 27.8 seconds.

The patient has a history of duodenal ulcer, which was treated with injection and is currently not actively bleeding. They also have a history of cholecystitis, which is pending further evaluation. The patient has metastatic HCC by preliminary report, which will require further evaluation and management.

The patient's social situation is complex, as they are currently in jail and not allowed to be visited by family members. A police officer will accompany the patient at all times.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's coagulopathy and history of cirrhosis increase their risk of bleeding complications, including further hemorrhage from the nasal passage or other sites.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of liver disease increase their risk of developing infections, including sepsis and pneumonia.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to further decompensation and increased risk of mortality.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, and they may require further interventions to improve blood pressure and cardiac function.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of duodenal ulcer and cholecystitis increase their risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic HCC may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues, including acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, and metastatic disease. They require close monitoring and management to address these complications and improve their outcome."

   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on
   [**2-6**], but was postponed due to abdominal pain.  He was admitted on 2/5s
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 251**] ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low
   grade fevers and question hepatic encephalopathy.  He was also being
   treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an
   MRCP, read still pending at [**Hospital1 2570**]. He had a NGT placed for unclear
   reasons that caused nose bleeding and coughing up blood.  Today the
   patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L).
   He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on
   [**2-6**], but was postponed due to abdominal pain.  He was admitted on 2/5s
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 251**] ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low
   grade fevers and question hepatic encephalopathy.  He was also being
   treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an
   MRCP, read still pending at [**Hospital1 2570**]. He had a NGT placed for unclear
   reasons that caused nose bleeding and coughing up blood.  Today the
   patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L).
   He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

   Currently off sedation on trial of PSV
   Tagged RBC Scan:entirely negative
   Liver U/S:TIPS looks patent, velocity in reasonable range, numerous
   nodular structures in the liver
   OSH Records/MRCP:Put on Meropenem empirically for concern that patient
   looking more toxic/encephalpathic
   MRCP: 2/8/09Impression: Extensive multifocal HCC, signal abnormality in
   liver (majority of right lobe) causing biliary ductal dilation in right
   lobe w/extension of this mass into the portal vein. Very cirrhotic
   heterogenous liver with multiple nodules, concerning aspect is the
   signal abnormality invasing the veins but also with mass effect on the
   biliary ducts. Has TIPS; low signal in the TIP shunt at the portal
   venous end; TIPS might be partially occluded; get U/S to confirm
   thrombus. Distension/thickening of GB wall (can see this in cirrhosis
   vs CCY but no reason to think of acute ccy), has varices, small amount
   of ascites

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented to the hospital with hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, and jaundice. He has undergone a CT-scan that showed evidence of varices of the spleen and esophagus, cirrhosis with a possible mass, and soft tissue density in the bladder. He has also had multiple episodes of abdominal pain and has been treated with Motrin and Tylenol for pain.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low-grade fevers, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. He was treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an MRCP that showed extensive multifocal HCC and concern for HCC mass that may be compressing part of the TIPS.

The patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L) and was intubated in the ICU. He was transferred to the ED, where he continued to bleed via the left nare despite packing. He underwent an EGD that showed esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* HCV viral load: 70,000
* AFP: 11469
* Liver function tests (LFTs): Elevated ALT and AST
* Coagulation studies: INR 1.8, fibrinogen 93
* Complete blood count (CBC): Thrombocytopenia, anemia
* Electrolytes: Hyponatremia, hypokalemia

The patient's medical conditions include:

* HCV cirrhosis with TIPS
* HCC with possible mass compressing part of the TIPS
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Thrombocytopenia
* Coagulopathy

   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on
   [**2-6**], but was postponed due to abdominal pain.  He was admitted on 2/5s
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 251**] ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low

   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  DDx: variceal bleed, posterior arterial epistaxsis, PUD,
   gastritis, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **], esophagitis, vascular malformations. Unlikely
   aorto-enteric fistula.
   -- f/u GI recs regarding possible EGD tonight
   -- surgery is following, f/u recs
   -- ENT performed packing in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] call formal consult in AM
   -- IV Protonix gtt
   -- Octreotide gtt
   -- Meropenem IV for ppx given cirrhosis
   -- place a-line
   -- Check Hct and transfuse to goal Hct > 30 given active bleeding and
   cross match 4U
   -- Transfuse FFP & Cryo to maintain fibrinogen > 200
   -- given active bleeding transfuse plt >50
   -- - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr
   -- U/S to evaluate TIPS
   -- IO in place, will need to be changed within 24hrs
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission.
   -- place a-line and ABG
   -- cont ventilator setting, check ABG and wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -- Will sedate with propofol given liver disease and decreased
   metabolism of fentanyl/versed, but will switch if hypotensive.
   .
   #. DIC: Pt fibrinogen 93 and INR 1.8, although likely componenet of
   decreased synthetic function from liver disease
   -- trend coags/fibrinogen/d-dimer/
   -- transfuse FFP and cryo (maintain fibrinogen > 200)
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. U/S showed patent TIPS. There
   was question of hepatic mass per report
   -- f/u final RUQ U/S prelim patent TIPS, eval for ?mass
   -- check hep serologies
   -- check HCV VL
   -- will need to obtain prior records

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and a previous TIPS procedure for variceal bleeding. He presents to the ICU with hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, and jaundice. He was admitted to the hospital with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low-grade fevers, and suspected hepatic encephalopathy. The patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L) and was intubated in the ICU. He was transferred to the ED with ongoing bleeding from his left nare.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and has been bleeding from his left nare. He may have a variceal bleed or posterior arterial epistaxis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is a risk of aspiration of blood during emesis.
3. DIC: The patient has a fibrinogen level of 93 and an INR of 1.8, which may be due to decreased synthetic function from liver disease or a component of DIC.
4. HCV cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis and a previous TIPS procedure, which may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Cholecystitis: The patient has a question of cholecystitis and has been treated with meropenem.
6. Hematuria: The patient has a history of bladder mass and hematuria, and may require urology consult when stable.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to splenic sequestration in the setting of splenomegaly from cirrhosis.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and transfuse blood products as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory failure with ventilatory support and sedation.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulation parameters and transfuse FFP and cryo as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's cholecystitis with meropenem.
5. Obtain a urology consult when the patient is stable.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and transfuse platelets as needed.
7. Obtain prior records and perform further testing as needed to determine the cause of the patient's bleeding and other symptoms."
137700.0,223851,2195-02-12 06:20:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on
   [**2-6**], but was postponed due to abdominal pain.  He was admitted on 2/5s
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 251**] ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low
   grade fevers and question hepatic encephalopathy.  He was also being
   treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an
   MRCP, read still pending at [**Hospital1 2570**]. He had a NGT placed for unclear
   reasons that caused nose bleeding and coughing up blood.  Today the
   patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L).
   He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

   OSH Records/MRCP:Put on Meropenem empirically for concern that patient
   looking more toxic/encephalpathic
   MRCP: 2/8/09Impression: Extensive multifocal HCC, signal abnormality in
   liver (majority of right lobe) causing biliary ductal dilation in right
   lobe w/extension of this mass into the portal vein. Very cirrhotic
   heterogenous liver with multiple nodules, concerning aspect is the
   signal abnormality invasing the veins but also with mass effect on the
   biliary ducts. Has TIPS; low signal in the TIP shunt at the portal
   venous end; TIPS might be partially occluded; get U/S to confirm
   thrombus. Distension/thickening of GB wall (can see this in cirrhosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] for variceal bleeding who presents from prison to [**Hospital1 251**] with
   hematuria, dysuria, back pain, abdominal pain, jaundice x 2 months.  He
   underwent a CT-scan that reportly showed evidence of varices of the
   spleen & esophagus, cirrhosis with question of a mass, and soft tissue
   density in the bladder in [**Month (only) 795**].  He had 3-4 visits to the hospital
   secondary to abdominal pain and was being treated with Motrin and
   tylenol for pain.  He was going to have an outpatient cystoscopy on
   [**2-6**], but was postponed due to abdominal pain.  He was admitted on 2/5s
   admitted to the [**Hospital1 251**] ICU with worsening lethargy, tachypnea, low
   grade fevers and question hepatic encephalopathy.  He was also being
   treated for possible cholecystitis with meropenem and underwent an
   MRCP, read still pending at [**Hospital1 2570**]. He had a NGT placed for unclear
   reasons that caused nose bleeding and coughing up blood.  Today the
   patient developed hematemesis with a large amount of frank blood (~2L).
   He was intubated in the ICU and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   Epistaxis (Nosebleed)
   Assessment:
   Pt. has been packed in his left nare for over 36 hours.  No sign of
   current bleeding.  However last HCT at 0100 was 29.  This nare remains
   tamponade with balloon device. Baseline HCT of 35 at outside
   hospital.
   Action:
   Pt. remains HD stable.  Urine output greater than 30ml/hr.  Continued
   on Meropenum.
   Response:
   Still unclear if there was some variceal bleed involved in addition to
   the nose bleed.  *Note
 still suctioning dark red clots from back of
   throat.  Team assessed the bleeding.  No intervention at that time.
   Plan:
   Monitor  HCT q6h with possible red tag study if pt. rebleeds.  VS
   remains stable.  Continues on sedation.  Appears comfortably sedated.
   Possibility of being extubated today  if remains stable.
   Pt. is a  prisoner with guard at bedside. No visitors allowed to visit
   until approved by guards. Pt. has been weaned from previous vent
   settings, questionable plan for extubation today. Propofol gtt has been
   weaned from 30-20-10mcq. Pt. continues to receive Lactulose enema for
   questionalble encephopathy.

   Currently off sedation on trial of PSV
   Tagged RBC Scan:entirely negative
   Liver U/S:TIPS looks patent, velocity in reasonable range, numerous
   nodular structures in the liver
   OSH Records/MRCP:Put on Meropenem empirically for concern that patient
   looking more toxic/encephalpathic
   MRCP: 2/8/09Impression: Extensive multifocal HCC, signal abnormality in
   liver (majority of right lobe) causing biliary ductal dilation in right
   lobe w/extension of this mass into the portal vein. Very cirrhotic
   heterogenous liver with multiple nodules, concerning aspect is the
   signal abnormality invasing the veins but also with mass effect on the
   biliary ducts. Has TIPS; low signal in the TIP shunt at the portal
   venous end; TIPS might be partially occluded; get U/S to confirm
   thrombus. Distension/thickening of GB wall (can see this in cirrhosis
   vs CCY but no reason to think of acute ccy), has varices, small amount

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleed and is currently experiencing hematemesis with a large amount of bright red blood. This is a high-risk situation that requires close monitoring and possible intervention.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is a risk of aspiration of blood during emesis. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ventilator settings adjusted as necessary.
3. DIC: The patient has a high INR and low fibrinogen levels, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This requires close monitoring of coagulation studies and possible transfusion of FFP and cryo.
4. HCV Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis, which is a significant risk factor for liver failure and encephalopathy. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and treatment for HCV should be considered.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to splenic sequestration in the setting of splenomegaly from cirrhosis. This requires close monitoring of platelet counts and possible transfusion of platelets.
6. Hematuria: The patient has a history of bladder mass and hematuria, which requires further evaluation and possible urology consult.
7. Cholecystitis: The patient has a question of cholecystitis, which requires further evaluation and possible treatment.
8. Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and may be at risk for encephalopathy. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and treatment for encephalopathy should be considered if necessary.
9. Sepsis: The patient has a history of urosepsis and is currently receiving meropenem, which may increase the risk of sepsis. The patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other vital signs should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis.
10. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to immobility and the presence of a central line. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for several medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a tagged RBC scan, AFP, HCV, and MRCP, which revealed extensive multifocal HCC with portal vein extension. The patient has also been diagnosed with encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and fever. The patient is currently intubated and receiving respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/68 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's HCC and portal vein extension increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, a life-threatening condition characterized by acute kidney injury and liver dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and requirement for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleed may lead to further bleeding complications, including hypovolemic shock and coagulopathy.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased risk of delirium, seizures, and death.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including GI bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's HCC and portal vein extension increase the risk of liver failure, which can lead to multiorgan failure and death.
8. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a high risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extension into the portal vein, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been placed with low signal and decreased flow velocity. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status likely secondary to encephalopathy, and lactulose is being continued. The patient is also receiving treatment for respiratory failure, GI bleed, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to encephalopathy, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation is not optimized or if there is a delay in weaning.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
4. HCC Progression: The patient's HCC may continue to progress, leading to further liver damage and potential liver failure.
5. TIPS Complications: The patient's TIPS may develop complications such as thrombosis, stenosis, or occlusion, which can worsen the patient's condition.
6. Infection: The patient's fever may be a sign of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of certain medications.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutrition may be compromised due to the patient's inability to take oral medications and the need for gastric access.
9. Skin Breakdown: The patient's skin may break down due to the patient's immobility and the use of certain medications.
10. Psychological Distress: The patient's family may experience psychological distress due to the patient's critical illness and the uncertainty surrounding the patient's prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
 EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent. Patients HCt has been stable
   overnight.  Currently presume bleed is nasopharyngeal in origin but
   likely had some variceal  bleeding
   -- IV Protonix gtt
   -- Octreotide gtt
   -- Meropenem IV for ppx given cirrhosis
   -- Continue serial Hct q6, transfuse<27
   --Active Type and Cross
   --Cordis in place
   --Need to discuss w/IR whether pt is going to get variceal banding to
   prevent future bleeds
   --Will need to start nadolol when gets NGT/oral access
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well.
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Will need to start PO lactulose as PR not adequate; if not extubated
   will need to place NGT
   -Trend LFTs
   -Consider adding Rifaxamin
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia
   --have broadened coverage to include Vancomycin in addition to
   Meropenem
   --SBT this AM; but MS not adequate at this point for extubation given
   encephalopathy
   --Sputum cultures
   #. DIC: Pt fibrinogen 93 and INR 1.8, likely [**2-3**] consumption
   coagulopathy; resolving.
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of
   splenomegly from cirrhosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presents with epistaxis (nosebleed). He has undergone various interventions, including EGD, tagged RBC scan, and ultrasound, which have not revealed an active bleeding site. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and has been prescribed medications such as octreotide, meropenem, and vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.5-11.0 K/uL
* Hct: 26.2-31.4%
* Plt: 50-76 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 30-33 mmol/L
* Glucose: 131-140 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.9/25.6/1.5, ALT/AST: 104/221, Alk Phos/T Bili: 94/14.9, Differential-Neuts: 82.2%, Lymph: 11.8%, Mono: 5.0%, Eos: 0.9%, D-dimer: 2541 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 208 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 290 IU/L, Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 1.7 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED): The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS and presents with epistaxis. The plan includes upper GI bleed treatment, continued serial Hct monitoring, and transfusion if necessary.
* HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS: The patient has extensive multifocal HCC and concern for HCC mass compressing part of TIPS. The plan includes transplant and hepatology follow-up, lactulose treatment, and trend LFTs.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and possible aspiration of blood during emesis is suspected. The plan includes broadened coverage to include vancomycin and SBT this AM.
* DIC: The patient has fibrinogen 93 and INR 1.8, likely [**2-3**] consumption coagulopathy; resolving.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of splenomegaly from cirrhosis.
* FEN: The patient is NPO.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding and hypovolemic shock
* Aspiration pneumonia
* Respiratory failure
* DIC
* Thrombocytopenia
* HCC progression and liver failure
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   and platelets trending down today and received 1Uprbcs overnight.
   -- Protonix IV BID, d/c octreotide gtt
   -- Continue serial Hct q6, transfuse<27
   --NP Balloon removed today during rounds
   --Resume nadolol today given NGT is now in place
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well.
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Start PO lactulose now that ngt in place
   -Trend LFTs
   -Start Rifaxamin 400 TID today
   #Fever- Persistantly febrile, no clear source of infection although
   does have ascites in abdomen; ddx SBP vs pneumonia vs line infection.
   U/A negative.
   -Will add Flagyl
   -Continue levo/vanc
   -F/U culture data
   -D/C femoral cordis and send for culture
   -D/C Aline
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia Currently doing well on [**5-6**]
   --Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime
   --MS prohibitive to SBT/extubation currently; thus giving lactulose to
   improve hepatic encephalopathy
   --Discuss with family code status prior to extubation
   #. DIC: Pt fibrinogen 93 and INR 1.8, likely [**2-3**] consumption
   coagulopathy
   -Add haptoglobin given dropping Hct and concern for hemolysis
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of
   splenomegly from cirrhosis. Platelets 39 this AM
   -- transfuse pts > 50 given acitve bleeding
   -- cont to trend plts
   # FEN: NPO
   .
   # Access: Right fem cordis, PIV x3
   .
   # PPx: bowel regimen prn, pneumoboots, IV PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and a recent TIPS procedure, who presented with epistaxis. He was intubated due to upper GI bleed and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a high MELD score of 13, indicating severe liver disease, and is not a transplant candidate. He also has extensive multifocal HCC and concerns about HCC mass compressing part of the TIPS.

The patient is persistently febrile, with no clear source of infection, and has ascites in the abdomen. He has respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. He also has thrombocytopenia and a coagulopathy, likely due to DIC.

The patient's laboratory results show a low platelet count, low fibrinogen, and high INR. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated AST and ALT levels. His kidney function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and lack of clear source of infection make sepsis a potential complication.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration of blood during emesis and his current respiratory failure make aspiration pneumonia a potential complication.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's high MELD score and liver disease make hepatic encephalopathy a potential complication.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low fibrinogen and high INR levels make coagulopathy a potential complication.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count makes thrombocytopenia a potential complication.
6. DIC: The patient's low fibrinogen and high INR levels make DIC a potential complication.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and need for intubation make respiratory failure a potential complication.
8. GI Bleed: The patient's recent upper GI bleed and ongoing bleeding make GI bleed a potential complication.
9. HCC: The patient's extensive multifocal HCC and concerns about HCC mass compressing part of the TIPS make HCC a potential complication.
10. TIPS Failure: The patient's TIPS procedure and concerns about HCC mass compressing part of the TIPS make TIPS failure a potential complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics as necessary to prevent sepsis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with transfusions and anticoagulant therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if his condition worsens.
8. Consider palliative care involvement pending prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
Encephalopathy: start lactulose, continue low dose propofol due to
   biting and agitation off of it, until he has received at least 1-2 days
   of lactulose
HCC: extremely poor prognosis, no therapeutic options. Discussed with
   GI and oncology.
Decreased uring output: improved with IVF. Will start on maintenance
   IVF.
Fever: will send urine, repeat blood, and stool culture. To cover
   potential SBP will continue levofloxacin and add flagyl. d/c cordis,
   d/c A-line place central line.
Respiratory failure: no clear source of pneumnia or consolidation,
   extubation is pending clearing of mental status. We will discuss with
   family given dismal HCC prognosis about terminal extubation.
 Epistaxis / UGI bleed: no active bleeding visible, but hct has been
   trending down, ? hemolysis, will send smear. Will trend hct. d/c
   octreotide. ENT
s input appreciated. Catheter has been removed from
   nose as no evidence of active bleeding and concern for necrosis
   (blanching of tissue seen). Follow Hct
Goals of care: will have a meeting with the family today, consult
   social work.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), encephalopathy, and respiratory failure. They have a poor prognosis due to their underlying condition, and their care is focused on managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and their laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and d-dimer. They have also developed bilateral lower extremity edema and ascites. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they require mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen their respiratory and cardiovascular status.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if they do not receive adequate treatment, which could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and hypoxia.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy could progress to more severe forms, such as coma or brain death, if not managed properly.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's UGIB could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further bleeding, shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated d-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase suggest the possibility of infection, which could worsen their respiratory and cardiovascular status.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen suggest the possibility of renal failure, which could worsen their overall condition.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and poor nutritional intake could lead to malnutrition, which could worsen their overall condition.
10. Family and Social Issues: The patient's poor prognosis and terminal illness could lead to emotional distress for the family, and their social and emotional support needs should be addressed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
Encephalopathy: start lactulose, continue low dose propofol due to
   biting and agitation off of it, until 1 day of lactulose received at
   least.
HCC: extremely poor prognosis, no therapeutic options.
decreased U/O: improved with IVF. will start on maintenance.
Fever: will send urine, repeat blood, and stool culture. To cover
   potential SBP will continue levofloxacin and add flagyl. d/c cordis,
   d/c A-line place central line.
Respiratory failure: no clear source of pneumnia or consolidation,
   extubation is pending clearing of mental status. We will discuss with
   family given dismal HCC prognosis re terminal extubation.
 EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)/UGIB: no active bleeding visible, but hct has
   been trending down, ? hemolysis, will send smear. Will trend hct. d/c
   octreotide.
Goals of care: will have a meeting with the family today, consult
   social work.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and encephalopathy. They are being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and have a dismal prognosis due to their underlying liver cancer (HCC). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg. They are receiving respiratory support via a ventilator and have a high risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 63 x 10^9/L, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5. Their liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 221 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 104 IU/L. They also have elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and d-dimer.

The patient's physical examination shows bilateral lower extremity edema, ascites, and a soft abdomen. They are unresponsive and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at high risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and they are at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGIB is ongoing, and they are at risk of bleeding further.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions make them at risk of developing VTE.
6. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs): The patient's central line and arterial line make them at risk of developing CRBSIs.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and underlying medical conditions make them at risk of developing pneumonia.
8. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's underlying medical conditions and medications make them at risk of developing AKI.
9. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver and kidney function are abnormal, and they are at risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   remains stable and no further bleeding.
   -- Protonix IV BID, Octreotide for 5D
   -- [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfuse<21
   --Continue Nadolol
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well. Oncology
   consulted and felt prognosis very poor on the order of weeks
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Continue Lactulose
   -Continue Rifaxamin
   #Fever- Persistantly febrile, no clear source of infection although
   does have ascites in abdomen; ddx SBP vs pneumonia vs line infection.
   U/A negative.
   -Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl
   -F/U culture data
   -A line removed
   -Will need to remove cordis
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia Currently doing well on [**5-6**]
   --Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime/flagyl
   --Will have ongoing family discussion prior to removing tube although
   pts MS improving
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of
   splenomegly from cirrhosis. Platelets 27
   -- holding on platelets given goals of care; readdress today before
   tranfusing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with epistaxis and was intubated for airway protection. He has a poor prognosis due to extensive multifocal HCC and is not a transplant candidate. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and persistent fever. He has ascites and is receiving IV PPI, antibiotics, and octreotide.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a high risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The CXR shows possible evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 27, which is likely due to splenic sequestration in the setting of cirrhosis. Further transfusions may be necessary.
3. Fever: The patient has been persistently febrile, and the source of infection is unclear. The possibility of sepsis, pneumonia, or line infection needs to be considered.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, which may worsen his prognosis.
5. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and is at risk of further bleeding.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO and may be at risk of malnutrition.
7. Infection: The patient has ascites and may be at risk of infection.

Plan:

1. Continue IV PPI, antibiotics, and octreotide.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation if possible.
4. Consider removing the central line and cordis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a palliative care team for further management of his symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding,
   -- Protonix IV BID, Octreotide for 5D
   -- [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfuse<21
   --Continue Nadolol
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well. Oncology
   consulted and felt prognosis very poor on the order of weeks
   -Transplant and hepatology following, appreciate recs
   -Continue Lactulose
   -Trend LFTs
   -Continue Rifaxamin
   #Fever- Persistantly febrile, no clear source of infection although
   does have ascites in abdomen; ddx SBP vs pneumonia vs line infection.
   U/A negative.
   -Continue Vanc/Levo/Flagyl
   -F/U culture data
   -A line removed
   -Will need to remove cordis
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Pt intubated for airway protection.  Possible
   aspiration of blood during emesis although CXR clear on admission
   however spiked overnight and CXR appears to have possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia Currently doing well on [**5-6**]
   --Continue Vancomycin/Cefepime/flagyl
   --Will have ongoing family discussion prior to removing tube although
   pts MS improving
   .
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**2-3**] splenic sequestration in the setting of
   splenomegly from cirrhosis. Platelets 39 this AM
   -- holding on platelets given goals of care; readdress today

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and a recent TIPS procedure. He presents with epistaxis and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has a poor prognosis with a MELD score of 13 and extensive multifocal HCC. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, fever, thrombocytopenia, and ascites.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T=101.2°F, HR=72 bpm, BP=124/62 mmHg, RR=16 breaths/min, SpO2=99%
* Respiratory support: intubated with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2=40%, PEEP=5 cmH2O
* Hemodynamic monitoring: arterial line removed, central venous catheter present
* Fluid balance: 3,934 mL total in, 1,283 mL total out, with a balance of 2,651 mL
* Lab results:
	+ Hct=24.5%
	+ Haptoglobin=7
	+ WBC=6.3
	+ Platelets=39
	+ Creatinine=0.5 mg/dL
	+ Glucose=131 mg/dL
	+ LFTs: ALT/AST=77/163, Alk Phos/T Bili=76/14.7
* Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed, HCV cirrhosis, MELD score=13, HCC, respiratory failure, fever, thrombocytopenia, ascites
* Plan:
	+ Continue proton pump inhibitor and octreotide for 5 days
	+ Transfuse for Hct <21
	+ Continue lactulose and trend LFTs
	+ Continue rifaximin
	+ Remove arterial line and cordis
	+ Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl
	+ Discuss prognosis with GI and consider getting palliative care involved
	+ Readdress goals of care and code status

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the upper GI tract
* Development of aspiration pneumonia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of ascites and fever
* Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory status
* Thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to splenic sequestration
* Hepatic encephalopathy or worsening of liver function
* Infection or line-related complications due to the presence of central venous catheters and arterial lines
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension
* Renal failure or worsening of renal function due to the patient's cirrhosis and potential for dehydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Plan:
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Pt with hematemsis at [**Hospital1 251**] and was intubated.
   Pt with continued bleeding in the ED.  Pt with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   for prior variceal bleed in [**2182**].  Pt with large amout of bright red
   blood emesis ~2L at OSH. Pt blood pressure stable SBP 120's, but
   episodes of tachycardia.  Continued bleeding via the left nare s/p
   packing.  Patient underwent EGD which showed esophageal varicies with
   stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. Duodenal ulcer (no
   active bleeding) that was injected. He underwent tagged rbc scan which
   did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding site nor any UGI/LGI bleed.
   Ultrasound showed TIPS is patent.. Currently presume bleed is
   nasopharyngeal in origin but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct
   remains stable and no further bleeding.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and a recent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. He was intubated and is currently being treated in the ICU for respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.2°F, blood pressure 124/62 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): White blood cell count 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, platelet count 27 K/uL.
	+ Liver function tests: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 163 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 77 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) 76 IU/L, total bilirubin (T Bili) 14.7 mg/dL.
	+ Coagulation studies: Prothrombin time (PT) 17.4 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 27.7 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.6.
	+ Blood chemistry: Creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, glucose 131 mg/dL, lactate 2.8 mmol/L.
* Imaging studies:
	+ Computed Tomography (CT) scan: Extensive multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and concern for HCC mass compressing part of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
* Medical history:
	+ HCV cirrhosis with TIPS placement.
	+ Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with liver dysfunction and encephalopathy.
* Current medications:
	+ Protonix IV BID.
	+ Octreotide for 5 days.
	+ Nadolol.
	+ Lactulose.
	+ Rifaximin.
	+ Vancomycin.
	+ Levofloxacin.
	+ Metronidazole.
* Potential complications:
	+ Respiratory failure.
	+ Upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
	+ Hepatic encephalopathy.
	+ Thrombocytopenia.
	+ Sepsis.
	+ Pneumonia.
	+ Aspiration pneumonia.
	+ Line infection.
	+ Catheter-related bloodstream infection.
	+ Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
	+ Pulmonary embolism (PE).
* Plan:
	+ Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
	+ Continue to treat the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation.
	+ Continue to manage the patient's bleeding with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and octreotide.
	+ Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
	+ Consider removing the central venous catheter (CVC) to reduce the risk of line infection.
	+ Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider adjusting medications as necessary.
	+ Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust medications as necessary.
	+ Consider discontinuing the patient's DVT prophylaxis if the patient is at low risk for DVT.

The patient's prognosis is poor, with a predicted survival time of weeks or days. The patient's family has been informed of his poor prognosis, and a plan for end-of-life care has been discussed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #Comfort Measures- Discussion had with family and given very poor
   prognosis, patient was made comfort measures only. He was started on
   morphine overnight.
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Currently no evidence of active bleeding. CMO no
   additional lab work Currently presume bleed is nasopharyngeal in origin
   but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct remains stable and no
   further bleeding.
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well. Oncology
   consulted and felt prognosis very poor on the order of weeks

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, post-TIPS, who was admitted with epistaxis. He was intubated and sedated, with bright red blood from the oropharynx. He was extubated and started on morphine for comfort measures only, given his poor prognosis. The patient has a MELD score of 13 and extensive multifocal HCC on MRCP, making him a non-candidate for liver transplant. He also has hepatic encephalopathy and a poor prognosis, estimated to be weeks.

Potential medical complications:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has had a recent upper GI bleed, which may recur due to his underlying liver disease and portal hypertension.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension may lead to recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening.
3. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleeding and portal hypertension increase the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
4. HCC progression: The patient's extensive multifocal HCC on MRCP may progress, leading to further liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and liver disease increase the risk of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension may lead to coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension may lead to hypoglycemia, especially if his glucose levels are not carefully monitored and managed.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and portal hypertension may lead to respiratory failure, especially if his oxygen saturation levels are not closely monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, who was admitted to the ICU with epistaxis and upper GI bleed. He was intubated and underwent EGD, which showed esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleed, but no active bleeding. He was also found to have a duodenal ulcer, which was injected. A tagged RBC scan did not show active nasopharyngeal bleeding or any other source of bleeding. His Hct remains stable, and no further bleeding has occurred.

The patient has a poor prognosis due to his HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, and extensive multifocal HCC, which is compressing part of his TIPS. His MELD score is 13, and his oncology consultation has deemed him a non-candidate for liver transplantation. He also has hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has been started on comfort measures only, including morphine, and has been extubated. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/78 mmHg. His respiratory support is limited to oxygen delivery via a face tent, with a FiO2 of 35%.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is likely to continue, given his HCV cirrhosis and s/p TIPS. He may require further interventions to control the bleeding, such as packing or injection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurological impairment and potential complications such as seizures or coma.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay make him susceptible to infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. DVT: The patient's immobility and prolonged ICU stay increase his risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress response to his critical illness may lead to stress ulceration, which could worsen his bleeding risk.
6. HCC progression: The patient's HCC may continue to progress, leading to further liver dysfunction and potential complications such as liver failure or metastasis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to further respiratory failure and potential complications such as respiratory acidosis or hypoxia.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status may deteriorate, leading to further instability and potential complications such as cardiac arrest or shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS
   [**2182**] who presents with epistaxis
   .
   Plan:
   #Comfort Measures- Discussion had with family and given very poor
   prognosis, patient was made comfort measures only. He was started on
   morphine overnight.
   #. Upper GI Bleed: Currently no evidence of active bleeding. CMO no
   additional lab work Currently presume bleed is nasopharyngeal in origin
   but likely had some variceal  bleeding, Hct remains stable and no
   further bleeding.
   .
   #. HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS. MELD of 13. MRCP showed extensive multifocal
   HCC and  concern for HCC mass  that may be compressing part of tips.
   HCV viral load 70K and AFP 21K. Given degree of HCC is not a transplant
   candidate. Currently has hepatic encepatholopathy as well. Oncology
   consulted and felt prognosis very poor on the order of weeks
   .

Summary:

The patient, a 42-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and TIPS, was extubated and transitioned to comfort measures only (CMO) due to a poor prognosis. He was started on morphine and has a history of upper GI bleed, with no evidence of active bleeding at the time of the note. The patient has extensive multifocal HCC and concern for HCC mass compressing part of the TIPS, making him a non-candidate for liver transplantation. He also has hepatic encephalopathy and is in the terminal stage of his illness.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and is now on comfort measures only, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has no evidence of active bleeding at the time of the note, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding due to his underlying liver disease and TIPS.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased risk of seizures, coma, and death.
4. Infections: The patient's immune system is compromised due to his liver disease and TIPS, making him susceptible to infections.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised due to his liver disease, which may lead to bleeding complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised due to his liver disease and may worsen over time, leading to renal failure.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is tenuous due to his liver disease, which may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure."
