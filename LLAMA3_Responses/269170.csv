   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with an unfortunate history of
   TPN-dependence leading to many complications of intravenous lines
   including infection, clots, etc.
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; covering
   with cefepime, adding fluconazole given recent hx of Mallasezia
   bacteremia. Watery ostomy output, vomiting earlier, may be volume down.
   - continuing cefepime
   - started fluconazole per discussion w ID
   - giving IVF as tolerated; difficult to give IVF and pressors
   simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other access
   available
   - levophed if not able to resuscitate with IVF
   - cultures pending
   .
   FEMORAL ACCESS
   ?of whether to revise this line. Have held plavix in the meantime.
   Concern for being off plavix would be for clotting the line; and/or
   extending existing clots.
   - consider lovenox while considering revising the line
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - trying short-term lovenox
   - monitor for side effects
   - restart plavix if not intending to revise the line
   .
   ANEMIA
   Lower than usual; some IVF; concern for GI bleed.
   - guaiac ostomy output
   - transfuse
   .
   FEN: No IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subacute stroke, hypodensity in the left basal ganglia, and possible hypodensity in the left cerebellum. She has a history of TPN dependence and has experienced complications with intravenous lines, including infections and clots.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension, which may be related to infection or volume depletion
* Fever earlier, which has been covered with cefepime and fluconazole
* Watery ostomy output and vomiting, which may be indicative of volume depletion
* Anemia, which is likely related to lower than usual hemoglobin levels and concern for GI bleed
* PEG tube in place, with an uneven surgical scar at midline, old, and an ostomy bag filled with liquid material

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Cefepime for coverage of infection
* Fluconazole for coverage of Mallasezia bacteremia
* Norepinephrine for blood pressure support
* Enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis
* Morphine sulfate for pain management

The patient's lab results indicate:

* WBC: 2.5 K/uL
* Hct: 19.0%
* Plt: 178 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to infection
* GI bleed or hematemesis due to anemia and vomiting
* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and tachycardia
* Thrombosis or clotting complications due to prolonged IV lines and lack of anticoagulation

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuing cefepime and fluconazole for infection coverage
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis or septic shock
* Reassessing anemia and considering transfusion
* Reevaluating IVF and pressors to ensure adequate blood pressure support
* Considering revising the femoral access line to reduce risk of clotting and infection
* Monitoring for side effects of lovenox and restarting plavix if not intending to revise the line

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is ICU."

   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   finding, especially with
fingernail
 and
number.  Head CT was done
   and showed areas of hypodensity in the L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum, concerning for sub-acute stroke
   - ID recs: dapto, cefepime, and fluconazole, when recultured also send
   another culture for malassezia (separate order in POE)
   - Only has two lumens in line, one for TPN, the other with
   pressors/fluids/abx, FYI: cefepime is not compatible with levophed
   - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] involved, would like to be kept updated about her line
   status, continuing ethanol post TPN

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including TPN dependence, multiple line infections, and a recent diagnosis of sub-acute stroke. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 101/53 mmHg, which is below normal. This is concerning, especially given her history of infections and the use of vasopressors.
* Sub-acute stroke: The patient has areas of hypodensity on her CT head, which is concerning for thromboembolism or septic embolism.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 6.2 g/dL, which is lower than normal. This is concerning, especially given her history of bleeding and the use of anticoagulants.
* Fever: The patient has a fever, which is concerning given her history of infections.

The patient is being treated with multiple medications, including:

* Cefepime: This is an antibiotic that is being used to treat the patient's infection.
* Fluconazole: This is an antifungal medication that is being used to treat the patient's fungal infection.
* Daptomycin: This is an antibiotic that is being used to treat the patient's infection.
* Levophed: This is a vasopressor that is being used to treat the patient's hypotension.
* Vasopressin: This is a medication that is being used to treat the patient's hypotension.
* Lovenox: This is an anticoagulant that is being used to prevent the patient from developing blood clots.
* Plavix: This is an anticoagulant that is being used to prevent the patient from developing blood clots.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 6.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 19.0%
* Platelets: 178 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 2.5 K/uL
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT head: Areas of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing treatment with cefepime, fluconazole, and daptomycin.
* Continuing treatment with levophed and vasopressin to treat the patient's hypotension.
* Considering transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs and ongoing fluid bolus with lactated ringer.
* Following up with the patient's neurologist to discuss further management of her sub-acute stroke.
* Considering revision of the patient's line, but holding off for now due to concerns about clotting and bleeding.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Thromboembolism or septic embolism due to her sub-acute stroke.
* GI bleed due to her anemia and the use of anticoagulants.
* Infection due to her history of line infections and the use of antibiotics.
* Hypotension due to her history of hypotension and the use of vasopressors.
* Stroke or extension of her sub-acute stroke due to her history of bleeding and the use of anticoagulants.

In summary, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines. She is currently receiving TPN and has a tunneled Hickman line for nutrition. She has been experiencing hypotension, fever, and watery ostomy output, which may be related to infection. She has also been experiencing word-finding difficulty, especially with fingernail and number words, which is concerning for sub-acute stroke. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and ABG readings within normal limits. Her lab results show anemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia, and she has a positive guaiac test for GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines increases her risk of infection. The patient is currently receiving cefepime and fluconazole to cover for potential infections, and cultures are pending.
2. Stroke: The patient's word-finding difficulty, especially with fingernail and number words, is concerning for sub-acute stroke. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the extent of the stroke and potential for recovery.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient's anemia and positive guaiac test for GI bleeding suggest a potential bleeding complication. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and extent of the bleeding.
4. Thrombosis: The patient's history of past pulmonary embolism and current use of Plavix and Lovenox increases her risk of thrombosis. Further monitoring is needed to detect any potential thrombotic complications.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a net fluid deficit of 3,283 mL over the past 24 hours. Further monitoring and management are needed to ensure the patient's fluid balance is stable.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may be related to her anemia, and further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and potential for recovery.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be related to her fluid imbalance, and further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the cause and potential for recovery.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely to detect any potential complications.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and ABG readings within normal limits.
3. Continue to administer cefepime and fluconazole to cover for potential infections.
4. Consider restarting Plavix if the patient's line is revised or if the patient is not experiencing any bleeding complications.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust IVF and pressors as needed to ensure the patient's fluid balance is stable.
6. Consider transfusing the patient if her anemia is severe and not responding to other treatment.
7. Monitor the patient's word-finding difficulty and consider further evaluation and treatment if it persists or worsens."

   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and complications, including infection, clots, and bacteremia. She is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, sub-acute stroke, and anemia. She has been experiencing word finding difficulty, which is a new finding over the last 11 weeks. Her CT head scan shows areas of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum, consistent with sub-acute stroke. She has a history of clots and bacteremia, and is at risk for thromboembolism or septic embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thromboembolism or septic embolism: Given the patient's history of clots and bacteremia, there is a risk of thromboembolism or septic embolism, which could lead to further complications such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, or sepsis.
2. Stroke extension or new stroke: The patient's history of clots and bacteremia increases her risk of stroke extension or new stroke, which could lead to further neurological deficits or even death.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences further bleeding or if her transfusion needs are not met, which could lead to decreased oxygen delivery and further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's history of bacteremia and current infections (e.g. C-dif negative) increases her risk of further infections, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if her blood pressure is not adequately managed, which could lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs and further complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's dependence on TPN may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her overall health and increase her risk of further complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor her and manage her care accordingly. This may include adjusting her antibiotic regimen, anticoagulation therapy, and nutritional support, as well as providing close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with an unfortunate history of
   TPN-dependence leading to many complications of intravenous lines
   including infection, clots, etc.
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; covering
   with cefepime, fluconazole given recent hx of Mallasezia bacteremia.
   Watery ostomy output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may
   be volume down.
   - continue cefepime
   - continue fluconazole per discussion w ID
   - giving IVF as tolerated; difficult to give IVF and pressors
   simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other access
   available
   - started levophed given SBPs in 70s despite 5 L volume rescuscitation
   with good response
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro
   - TTE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   .
   FEMORAL ACCESS
   ?of whether to revise this line. Have held plavix in the meantime.
   Concern for being off plavix would be for clotting the line; and/or
   extending existing clots, risk of new stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - pt has h/o bleeding with lovenox
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - trying short-term lovenox
   - monitor for side effects
   - restart plavix if not intending to revise the line
   .
   ANEMIA
   Lower than usual; some IVF; concern for GI bleed.
   - guaiac trace positive
   - transfuse 2 units PRBCs, which should help with oxygen delivery in
   setting of potential sepsis
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - continue tube feeds
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time
   given hypertension, ectopy with increased rate of infusion with
   norepinephrine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence, leading to complications such as infection, clots, and bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU with the following conditions:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is associated with fever and may be related to infection. She is being treated with cefepime and fluconazole.
2. SUB-ACUTE STROKE: The patient has developed word finding difficulty, which is a new finding over the past 11 weeks. A CT head scan showed areas of hypodensity in the L basal ganglia and L cerebellum, suggesting a sub-acute stroke. The patient is at risk for thromboembolism or septic embolism due to her history of clots and bacteremia.
3. FEMORAL ACCESS: The patient has a femoral access line, which is being monitored for potential complications. The patient has a history of bleeding with Lovenox and is currently on Plavix.
4. PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM: The patient has a history of past pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption.
5. ANEMIA: The patient has lower-than-usual hemoglobin levels and is at risk for GI bleed.
6. OTHER CONDITIONS: The patient has a waterly ostomy output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, and may be volume-depleted.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's history of bacteremia and the presence of a central line.
* Thromboembolism or septic embolism due to the patient's history of clots and bacteremia.
* Stroke or extension of stroke due to the patient's history of clots and bacteremia.
* GI bleed due to the patient's anemia and history of bleeding with Lovenox.
* Infection and sepsis due to the patient's history of TPN dependence and central line.
* Hypotension and shock due to the patient's history of hypotension and potential sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing cefepime and fluconazole for infection.
* Monitoring the patient's femoral access line for potential complications.
* Restarting Plavix if the patient's line is not revised.
* Transfusing 2 units of PRBCs to treat anemia.
* Repleting electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium.
* Continuing tube feeds and sliding scale for potassium and magnesium.
* Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely due to the potential for hypotension and shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with nausea and vomiting, hypotension, and a history of TPN dependence leading to multiple complications. She has a new finding of word finding difficulty, which is concerning for sub-acute stroke. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a temperature of 37.2°C and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 6.2 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 2.5 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 121 mg/dL. 

The patient has a history of past pulmonary embolism and is currently on sub-cutaneous heparin. She is also on Plavix for stents in place, which was held on admission due to concerns about revising the line. 

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, sub-acute stroke, anemia, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of clots and bacteremia, which may be contributing to her current symptoms. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of the patient's stroke symptoms, potentially leading to increased risk of bleeding or extension of the stroke.
2. Development of septicemia or sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's history of bleeding with Lovenox and her current use of sub-cutaneous heparin.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen the patient's anemia and increase the risk of complications.
5. Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to the patient's history of anemia and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Increased risk of infection due to the patient's history of bacteremia and her current use of antibiotics.
7. Potential need for surgical intervention to revise the patient's line or to manage her stroke symptoms.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of her stroke symptoms, laboratory results, and vital signs. The patient's line should be assessed regularly to determine the need for revision or replacement. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued, and she should be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's anemia should be managed with transfusions as necessary, and her electrolyte levels should be monitored and repleted as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, anemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 98/57 mmHg and a heart rate of 71 bpm. The patient is receiving levophed to support blood pressure and has been receiving IV fluids to manage volume resuscitation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 19.0%. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 2.4 mg/dL.

The patient's radiology results indicate a possible CVA in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, which is a significant concern given the patient's history of significant venous clots and the potential for paradoxical emboli to the arterial system.

The patient's medical history is significant for allergies to Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, and Betadine Surgi-Prep, as well as a history of seizures and rash. The patient's medications include levophed, norepinephrine, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate that they are at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is critically low, and they are at risk for further anemia if they do not receive adequate blood transfusions.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and they are at risk for further electrolyte imbalances if they do not receive adequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is critically low, and they are at risk for further hypotension if they do not receive adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
4. Acidosis: The patient's laboratory results indicate hyperchloremic acidosis, which is a significant concern given the patient's history of significant venous clots and the potential for paradoxical emboli to the arterial system.
5. PFO and paradoxical emboli: The patient's history of significant venous clots and the potential for paradoxical emboli to the arterial system raises concern about the possibility of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and the potential for paradoxical emboli to the arterial system.
6. Endocarditis: The patient's history of significant venous clots and the potential for paradoxical emboli to the arterial system raises concern about the possibility of endocarditis.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. They are at risk for several medical complications, including anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, acidosis, PFO and paradoxical emboli, and endocarditis. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
        - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old)
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly good
   response to levophed but will transition to vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVF as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow- Non-con
   Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman line and
   Have held plavix in the meantime. Concern for being off plavix would be
   for clotting the line; and/or extending existing clots, risk of new
   stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix once line placement is complete
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence, leading to complications with intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, fever, and potential subacute stroke. The patient's condition is complicated by her recent history of Malassezia bacteremia and the need for antibiotics and pressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, comfortable, and anxious individual with normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular findings. Her respiratory and abdominal examinations are also normal. She has a soft and tender abdomen, with a PEG tube in place and an ostomy bag with liquid material.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 19.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 178 K/uL. Her blood chemistry is within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, potential subacute stroke, and anemia. She has a history of past pulmonary embolism and is currently on subcutaneous heparin.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Levophed weaning off and transition to vasopressin.
2. IR procedure to change out TPN line to a temporary 4-lumen line.
3. Antibiotic regimen consisting of Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisome.
4. Subcutaneous heparin for thromboembolism prophylaxis.
5. Restarting Plavix once line placement is complete.
6. Monitoring of daily hemoglobin and electrolyte levels.
7. Holding TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products, and electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued hypotension and potential septic shock.
2. Progression of subacute stroke or development of new strokes.
3. Thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Infection and sepsis, particularly with the use of antibiotics and pressors.
5. Anemia and bleeding complications due to the patient's history of bleeding with lovenox and the need for anticoagulation.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and magnesium, due to the patient's ongoing medical conditions and treatments."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   .
   - Levophed weaned off at [**2136**] and vasopressin is infusing.
   - 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 19 after was 24
   - - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly good
   response to levophed but will transition to vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer

   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE

   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow- Non-con
   Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman line and
   Have held plavix in the meantime. Concern for being off plavix would be
   for clotting the line; and/or extending existing clots, risk of new
   stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix once line placement is complete
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs
   - monitor daily Hcts

   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and a recent history of Malassezia bacteremia. The patient has a difficult access situation with a Hickman line and has been experiencing word-finding difficulty, which may be related to a subacute stroke. She has been treated with antibiotics and vasopressors, and an IR procedure is planned to change out the TPN line to a temporary 4-lumen line.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of Malassezia bacteremia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of developing another infection, particularly if the Hickman line becomes infected.
2. Clots: The patient has a history of clots and is at risk of developing new clots, particularly with the use of vasopressors.
3. Subacute Stroke: The patient's word-finding difficulty may be related to a subacute stroke, and there is a risk of extension or new stroke development.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding with Lovenox and is currently on subcutaneous heparin. There is a risk of bleeding with the use of heparin or other anticoagulants.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 24, but there is a risk of developing anemia due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has low potassium and magnesium levels, which need to be repleted.
7. C. difficile Infection: The patient has had two negative C. difficile tests, but there is still a risk of developing C. difficile infection, particularly with the use of antibiotics.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition or prolonged use of TPN.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to the use of a Hickman line and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and the use of anticoagulants."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   .
   - Levophed weaned off at [**2136**] and vasopressin is infusing.
   - 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 19 after was 24
   - - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
        - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old); canceled b/c can
t take downstaris and can
t do bedside.
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   .
   - Levophed weaned off at [**2136**] and vasopressin is infusing.
   - 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 19 after was 24
   - - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure today to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear
   - Neuro Recs: suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
        - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old); canceled b/c can
t take downstaris and can
t do bedside.
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1
   - transfused 1 unit PRBCs for Hct 19 through TPN line

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Will attempt to wean
   vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   now. Plan for double lumen to be replaced by quad today by IR
   - IR procedure pending
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  pending above
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of Malassezia bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics for a suspected infection. There is a risk of further infection, particularly with the temporary 4-lumen line being used for TPN.
2. Thromboembolism or septic embolism: The patient has a history of clots and bacteremia, which increases the risk of thromboembolism or septic embolism. The neuro team is concerned about this possibility, and a TEE is planned to evaluate for clots/vegetations.
3. Stroke: The patient has areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L cerebellum, which may indicate a subacute stroke. The neuro team does not think this is a subacute stroke, but the patient's word finding difficulty is a concern.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient's stool studies show a negative result for C. difficile, but the ID team is considering getting 3 C. difficile toxin tests to confirm the result.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 24, but the patient is still anemic. Further transfusions may be necessary to maintain a safe Hct level.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, and repletion is ongoing. There is a risk of further electrolyte imbalance if the patient's potassium and magnesium levels are not closely monitored.
7. Access issues: The patient has difficult access due to the TPN/Hickman line, which is being replaced by an IR procedure today. There is a risk of complications with the new line, including bleeding or infection.
8. Bleeding risk: The patient has a history of bleeding with lovenox, and the neuro team is concerned about this risk. The patient is currently on sub-cutaneous heparin, and plavix will be restarted pending the outcome of the IR procedure.
9. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, but there is a risk of malnutrition if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition.
10. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics as prescribed by the ID team.
2. Monitor the patient's blood counts, electrolyte levels, and renal function closely.
3. Perform a TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations.
4. Replace the temporary 4-lumen line with a double lumen catheter as soon as possible.
5. Restart plavix pending the outcome of the IR procedure.
6. Monitor the patient's access site for signs of bleeding or infection.
7. Continue to provide IVFs as tolerated, and consider using a different IV fluid if the patient's potassium and magnesium levels are not stable.
8. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary."

   - Need to call Cardiology in AM to 1.) schedule TEE (already ordered)
   2.) see if regular TTE gives any indication of PFO... if not, consider
   that she may need bubble study
   - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   (she is already getting anesthesia for IR procedure tomorrow - would
   have to coordinate to see if IR would be ok w Cards doing TEE after
   their procedure in the IR suite... unlikely.  Cards would also have to
   be willing to do so.  #[**Numeric Identifier 10170**] is TEE fellow pager)
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with an unfortunate history of
   TPN-dependence leading to many complications of intravenous lines
   including infection, clots, etc.
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - all interventions have to be balanced in the context of limited
   access and potential interactions between infusions.  Will touch base
   with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] to discuss ability to use dedicated TPN line for
   other infusions
   - continue cefepime, daptomycin
   - continue fluconazole per discussion w ID
   - giving IVF as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - started levophed given SBPs in 70s despite 5 L volume
   rescuscitation.  good response to levophed but will transition to
   vasopressin
   - will consider transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs and ongoing fluid bolus
   with lactated ringer
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro consulting and will follow
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed
   - TTE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow neuro recs for further management and degree to which
   symptoms correlate to CT findings
   .
   FEMORAL ACCESS
   ?of whether to revise this line. Have held plavix in the meantime.
   Concern for being off plavix would be for clotting the line; and/or
   extending existing clots, risk of new stroke or extension of stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   - pt has h/o bleeding with lovenox
   - restart plavix if deciding to treat through and keep the current line
   - no plan to change line for now, awaiting culture data
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix if not intending to revise the line
   .
   ANEMIA
   Lower than usual; some IVF; concern for GI bleed.
   - guaiac trace positive
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs, follow up HCT
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time
   given hypertension, ectopy with increased rate of infusion with
   norepinephrine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2146-8-25**] 08:22 AM
   - cortisol was normal this AM
   - Concern for septic emboli -- if anticoagulated more and has septic
   emboli, then the septic emboli could cause bleeding; however, she does
   have many stents
   - pt has had a reaction to lovenox in past
   - Non-con Head CT showed 2 areas of concern for subacute stroke.  Neuro
   suggested putting her on subq heparin and get a TTE
   - Neuro Recs:
   1.) not convinced that she had stroke -- they think it may be
   infectious and wish for us to do an LP and check cytology, cultures,
   cell count diff, which we have not done because we are not sure that it
   will change management, so holding off
   2.) TEE for vegetations (TTE did not show vegetations)
   3.) C-spine Xray to R/O cervical spondylosis as cause of increased
   right hand weakness (unclear hx whether right arm weakness is acute or
   old)
   - Levophed at 0.15mcg/hr this AM
   - levophed not compatible w cefepime; pt cannot tolerate antibiotics
   through same port as levophed -- gets headaches and feels badly
   - Plan to wean off levophed today and start vasopressin (through same
   line), goal MAP >60
   - Had meeting with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1112**] and ID team regarding lines/access
   and decided the following:  pt will get IR procedure tomorrow to try to
   place 4-lumen line temporarily (likely will change out old tunneled
   catheter over a wire)-- Note: this 4-lumen line will just be temporary
   bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be replaced with a
   double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - Of note, Blanch [**Doctor Last Name 1112**] states that pt may not be getting appropriate
   line care at home; pt states that she is doing all the line care
   herself (but she is comfortable at home and would not want to have to
   live elsewhere), but her sister has alluded to the idea that she her
   line care has not been ideal (unclear)
   - ID Recs:
   1.) Broaden antibiotics further by changing them to Daptomycin,
   Meropenem, and Ambisone (from Dapto, Cefepime, Micafungin)
   2.) consider getting 3 C.diff toxin tests, rather than just 1
   - transfused 1 unit PRBCs for Hct 19 through TPN line
   - stoma output stool studies sent: bicarbonate <5 (not wasting bicarb
   in stool)
   - Will Use LR as fluid rather than NS
   - Need to call Cardiology in AM to 1.) schedule TEE (already ordered)
   2.) see if regular TTE gives any indication of PFO... if not, consider
   that she may need bubble study
   - Pt agrees to TEE as long as she can get anesthesia
   (she is already getting anesthesia for IR procedure tomorrow - would
   have to coordinate to see if IR would be ok w Cards doing TEE after
   their procedure in the IR suite... unlikely.  Cards would also have to
   be willing to do so.  #[**Numeric Identifier 10170**] is TEE fellow pager)
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   --> also need to call anesthesia in AM to move up line placement in
   their schedule b/c her improved access is so important to get before
   the weekend
   - pt had one episode in the late evening of sudden crampy pain that
   woke her up from sleep, initially felt in the neck but then felt all
   the way down her back, more in the midline; neuro exam did not seem to
   show any changes, pt's mental status still intact, negative signs for
   meningitis

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) dependence, leading to complications with intravenous lines, including infection and clotting. She was admitted with a fever and hypotension, and was found to have a subacute stroke with areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. She has a history of clots and bacteremia, and is at risk for thromboembolism or septic embolism.

The patient's current medications include levophed, vasopressin, and subcutaneous heparin, and she is receiving IV antibiotics and fluids. She has a tunneled Hickman line and a peripheral IV line, and is receiving TPN.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, and heart rate of 70 bpm. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 19.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 178 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a low potassium level, which is being repleted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thromboembolism or septic embolism: The patient's history of clots and bacteremia, combined with her current subacute stroke, puts her at risk for thromboembolism or septic embolism.
2. Infection: The patient's history of TPN dependence and her current IV lines put her at risk for infection.
3. Clotting: The patient's history of clots and her current use of subcutaneous heparin put her at risk for clotting.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding with lovenox and her current use of subcutaneous heparin put her at risk for bleeding.
5. Stroke progression: The patient's current subacute stroke may progress, leading to further neurological deficits.
6. Septic shock: The patient's current sepsis and her history of bacteremia put her at risk for septic shock.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's history of TPN dependence and her current IV nutrition put her at risk for malnutrition.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's current electrolyte imbalance, particularly her low potassium level, may lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to provide IV antibiotics and fluids as needed.
3. Consider restarting plavix if the patient's line is not revised.
4. Continue to replete the patient's electrolytes, particularly potassium.
5. Consider transfusing additional blood products as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Consider performing a TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations.
8. Continue to follow up with the patient's ID team and neurology team to ensure that her treatment plan is appropriate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient's condition has improved slightly, with increased urine output and no pain or dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 92/59 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving vasopressin and morphine sulfate infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and hypotension, but the blood pressure has improved. The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.4 g/dL, and their hematocrit is 24.2%. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, and their neurological examination is normal, with the patient able to follow simple commands, respond to verbal stimuli, and move purposefully.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still slightly low, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but a slight imbalance can still occur, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's negative cultures do not rule out the possibility of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Valve vegetations: The patient's echocardiogram may show valve vegetations, which can lead to endocarditis, heart failure, and other complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and heart failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which can lead to respiratory failure, especially if their oxygenation status worsens.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and electrolyte imbalance can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen their anemia and electrolyte imbalance.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is stable, but they are at risk for several potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management of their condition are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal outcome."

   - Can re-start plavix 48 hours s/p quad placement as if anything
   happens to quad it will happen in 48 hours per IR. Also consider
   holding if getting TEE on Monday.
   - pt will need to get another procedure to replace Quad-lumen to get
   Double-lumen catheter again before leaving the hospital
   - TEE to look for vegetations will happen on Monday; cards couldn't do
   it Friday.
   - c. diff #3 pending
   - Did not give boluses overnight b/c doesn't have a foley. In AM, try
   giving a bolus of LR if still not off pressors.
   - FSBS in 260s overnight with TPN. Gave 4 units of regular insulin.
   Should touch base with nutrition in AM...insulin in TPN?

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Dedicated TPN line used to infuse antibiotics in the
   context of need for antibiotics and pressors and inability to transfuse
   together.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Will attempt to wean
   vasopressin
   -  IR procedure schedule today to change out TPN line to temporary 4
   lumen; temporary bc they clot off more easily, and it will have to be
   replaced with a double lumen catheter before the pt cant return home
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - giving IVFs as tolerated with ringer
s lactate; difficult to give IVF
   and pressors simultaneously so have to choose between these; no other
   access available
   - cultures pending
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations per neuro
   - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   now. Plan for double lumen to be replaced by quad today by IR
   - IR procedure pending
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  pending above
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2146-8-26**] 01:00 PM
   tip of 20 cm cath is in lt illiac vein,. placed in IR with tip just
   before entering stent in IVC
   - Access: IR procedure to get temporary Quad-lumen done. Placed quad in
   a stent and left existing femoral in place. Can't use TPN in new quad
   b/c will clog up in stent. So, old femoral will be dedicated to tpn and
   new quad will be for everything else.
   - temporarily off vasopressin (about one and a half hours) then became
   hypotensive even after fluid boluses. Re-started vasopressin and
   continued fluid boluses. Got 2 L NS and 1 L of LR.
   - final TTE IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant
   regurgitant valvular disease seen. Normal global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Can re-start plavix 48 hours s/p quad placement as if anything
   happens to quad it will happen in 48 hours per IR. Also consider
   holding if getting TEE on Monday.
   - pt will need to get another procedure to replace Quad-lumen to get
   Double-lumen catheter again before leaving the hospital
   - TEE to look for vegetations will happen on Monday; cards couldn't do
   it Friday.
   - c. diff #3 pending
   - Did not give boluses overnight b/c doesn't have a foley. In AM, try
   giving a bolus of LR if still not off pressors.
   - FSBS in 260s overnight with TPN. Gave 4 units of regular insulin.
   Should touch base with nutrition in AM...insulin in TPN?

   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."" She is currently on Plavix for
   stents in place; this was held on admission because of concern about
   revising the line.
   - on sub cutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  pending above
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will hold TPN in favor of providing pressors, IVF, blood products,
   and electrolytes
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion
   - difficult to transfuse potassium and norepinephrine at same time,
   ectopy with increased rate of infusion with norepinephrine.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 47-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU due to her history of TPN dependence, which has led to multiple complications with intravenous lines, including infection, clots, and bacteremia. She was admitted with hypotension, fever, and watery ostomy output. The patient has undergone an IR procedure to change out her TPN line to a temporary 4-lumen catheter, which will need to be replaced with a double-lumen catheter before she can be discharged.

The patient has been experiencing word finding difficulty, which was noted by the patient and her family to be new within the last week. A CT head without contrast showed areas of hypodensity in the L basal ganglia and L cerebellum, leading to concerns about thromboembolism or septic embolism. The patient's neurologist does not think this is a subacute stroke.

The patient has a history of past pulmonary embolism and is currently on subcutaneous heparin. She is also on Plavix for stents in place, which was held on admission due to concerns about revising the line.

The patient's laboratory results show stable anemia, with a guaiac test trace positive and a recent transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs. Her electrolytes are being monitored daily, and she is receiving IVF, TPN, and repletion of electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Infection: The patient's history of TPN dependence and bacteremia puts her at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient's history of clots and bacteremia, combined with her word finding difficulty and areas of hypodensity on CT head, increases her risk for thromboembolism, which could lead to stroke or pulmonary embolism.
3. Septic embolism: The patient's bacteremia and areas of hypodensity on CT head increase her risk for septic embolism, which could lead to organ failure and death.
4. Malassezia infection: The patient's recent history of Malassezia bacteremia and watery ostomy output increases her risk for another Malassezia infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable anemia increases her risk for complications related to anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly with low potassium and magnesium levels, increases her risk for cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
7. Pressure ulcer: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and her history of TPN dependence increase her risk for pressure ulcers, which could lead to infection and sepsis.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay on the ventilator increases her risk for VAP, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - Patient with hyponatremia this morning, further IV fluids will
   receive NS
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  likely post TEE on Monday
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**8-24**])
   - Patient with hyponatremia this morning, further IV fluids will
   receive NS
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  likely post TEE on Monday
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence and multiple complications related to intravenous lines. She was recently admitted to the ICU with hypotension, fever, and word finding difficulty. She has a history of Malassezia bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics. The patient has a difficult access situation with a quad-lumen catheter in her left femoral vein, which is placed in a stent and cannot be used for TPN. She is currently receiving vasopressin for hypotension and has been weaned off levophed.

The patient has a sub-acute stroke diagnosis, with areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and left cerebellum. The neurologist does not think this is a sub-acute stroke. The patient has a history of bleeding with lovenox and has been switched to subcutaneous heparin.

The patient has anemia, which is stable at 24%. She has had a guaiac test positive for blood in her stool and has received a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs. She will be monitored daily for Hcts and will follow up on prior anemia work-up.

The patient's electrolytes are low, with potassium and magnesium levels being repleted. She is receiving TPN through her original line with ethanol dwells and will continue to receive magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion. She is also receiving sublingual ativan for anxiety due to her decreased access.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of Malassezia bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics. She may be at risk for developing another infection, particularly in her quad-lumen catheter.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient has a history of clots and bacteremia, which may increase her risk for thromboembolism or septic embolism.
3. Hypotension: The patient is currently receiving vasopressin for hypotension and may be at risk for developing further hypotension.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if she continues to experience bleeding or has difficulty with blood transfusions.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are low, which may increase her risk for developing further electrolyte imbalances.
6. TPN-related complications: The patient is receiving TPN, which may increase her risk for developing complications such as TPN-related sepsis or catheter-related infections.
7. Sub-acute stroke: The patient has a sub-acute stroke diagnosis, which may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment.
8. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding with lovenox and may be at risk for further bleeding with subcutaneous heparin."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with short gut syndrome who was admitted with concern for line-related sepsis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a multi-lumen catheter and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/57 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and hypotension, but no signs of septic shock.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin patient with symmetric expansion and dullness on percussion of the chest. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient's skin is not assessed, and the patient's neurologic examination is incomplete.

The patient's medical history is significant for short gut syndrome, and the patient has undergone several previous interventions, including the placement of a tunneled (Hickman) line.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Line-related complications: The patient's multi-lumen catheter can cause bleeding, infection, or occlusion, which can lead to further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen if not addressed, leading to organ hypoperfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if not treated, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not corrected.
6. Pain control: The patient's acute pain and chronic pain require adequate management to prevent complications such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and anxiety.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's short gut syndrome can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as malabsorption, diarrhea, and vomiting.

In summary, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. The patient's sepsis, line-related complications, hypotension, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, pain control, and gastrointestinal complications all require careful attention to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Has currently resolved, patient with no pressor requirement since
   yesterday morning.  Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to
   infection; switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID
   concerned about another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history
   of Malassezia bacteremia.  All cultures negative to date.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1
   [**8-24**])
per ID they may pull back in the near future if cultures remain
   negative
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due to concern
   for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o bleeding with
   lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Plavix was held in the setting of new line from IR, but will restart
   since it is 48 hours post procedure
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  today
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 26.8
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - will adjust TPN to account for repletion of K and Mg that she has
   been receiving daily in the ICU
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Has currently resolved, patient with no pressor requirement since
   yesterday morning.  Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to
   infection; switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID
   concerned about another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history
   of Malassezia bacteremia.  All cultures negative to date.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1
   [**8-24**])
per ID they may pull back in the near future if cultures remain
   negative
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due to concern
   for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o bleeding with
   lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Plavix was held in the setting of new line from IR, but will restart
   since it is 48 hours post procedure
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  today
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 26.8
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - will adjust TPN to account for repletion of K and Mg that she has
   been receiving daily in the ICU
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence, leading to multiple complications with intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She is currently in the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remained stable in the 90s systolic after being weaned off vasopressin. However, she had a fever earlier, which may be related to infection. She is currently on Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisome per ID recommendations.
2. Sub-acute stroke: The patient has word-finding difficulty, which is new over the last 11 weeks. Areas of hypodensity on CT head without contrast in the L basal ganglia and L cerebellum are present. The neurologist does not think this is a sub-acute stroke.
3. Access: The patient has difficult access due to the placement of hardware in her vein, making it impossible to give TPN through the Hickman line. However, she can use the line for pressors, antibiotics, and fluids.
4. Past pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. She is currently on subcutaneous heparin and will restart Plavix today.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable at 26.8%. She has received a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs and will continue to monitor her Hcts daily. She will also follow up on her prior anemia work-up, especially since she is now on Daptomycin, which can cause marrow suppression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is currently on antibiotics. She may develop sepsis or septic shock if her infection is not properly managed.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient has a history of clots and bacteremia, which may increase her risk of thromboembolism or septic embolism.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of bleeding with Lovenox and is currently on subcutaneous heparin. She may be at risk for bleeding if she develops a septic thrombus.
4. Marrow suppression: The patient is currently on Daptomycin, which can cause marrow suppression. She may develop anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on subcutaneous heparin. She may be at risk for another pulmonary embolism if her anticoagulation therapy is not properly managed.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of infection, thromboembolism, or hemorrhage. Her anticoagulation therapy should be carefully managed to minimize the risk of bleeding. Additionally, her anemia should be closely monitored, and her Daptomycin therapy should be adjusted as needed to minimize the risk of marrow suppression."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Has currently resolved, patient with no pressor requirement since
   yesterday morning.  Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to
   infection; switched to Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID
   concerned about another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history
   of Malassezia bacteremia.  All cultures negative to date.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**8-25**]) and Daptomycin (day 1
   [**8-24**])
per ID they may pull back in the near future if cultures remain
   negative
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**11-26**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**2116**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due to concern
   for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o bleeding with
   lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR, but will continue to for hold given
   likely TEE on Monday
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR ""because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled.""
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  likely post TEE on Monday
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 26.8
   - guaiac trace positive [**8-25**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**8-25**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion.
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of TPN dependence, leading to complications with intravenous lines, including infection and clots. She is currently in the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable in the 90s systolic, and she has been weaned off vasopressin. However, she will continue to receive antibiotics, including Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisome, per ID recommendations.
2. Sub-acute stroke: The patient has word finding difficulty, which is new and was noted by the patient and family over the last 1-2 weeks. Areas of hypodensity were seen on CT head without contrast in the left basal ganglia and cerebellum. The neurologist does not think this is a sub-acute stroke.
3. Access: The patient has difficult access due to the placement of a stent in the vein, making it unable to give TPN. However, she can use the line for pressors, antibiotics, and fluids.
4. Past pulmonary embolism: The patient is not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions and difficulties with absorption. She was previously on Lovenox, which was stopped due to welts and bleeding. She is currently on subcutaneous heparin and will restart Plavix post TEE on Monday.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable at 26.8%, and she received a transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs on [**8-25**]. Her Hct will be monitored daily, and she will follow up on prior anemia work-up.
6. FEN: The patient will continue to receive IVF, TPN, and repletion of electrolytes. Her TPN will be continued through her original line with ethanol dwells.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's history of TPN dependence and previous infections may increase her risk of developing new infections.
2. Clots: The patient's history of clots and bacteremia may increase her risk of developing new clots, which could lead to thromboembolism or septic embolism.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences bleeding or if her bone marrow is suppressed due to Daptomycin therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if she experiences infection or bleeding.
5. Sub-acute stroke: The patient's word finding difficulty may worsen if she experiences a sub-acute stroke or if her condition is not managed properly.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and her current use of subcutaneous heparin may increase her risk of developing a new pulmonary embolism.

The patient's condition will require close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure her safe transition to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of short gut syndrome and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) admission with sepsis and concern for line-related sepsis. She has shown improvement with empiric treatment, but the source of sepsis remains unclear. The patient is experiencing persistent chronic abdominal pain and new groin pain, and is being managed with pain medication. She has anemia, and her electrolyte and fluid balance are being monitored closely.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has improved with treatment, but the source of sepsis remains unclear. Continued monitoring and investigation are necessary to identify the source and prevent further complications.
2. Line-related sepsis: The patient has a tunneled Hickman line and a multi-lumen line, which increases the risk of line-related sepsis. Close monitoring of the lines and regular dressing changes are necessary to prevent infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to her chronic TPN and short gut syndrome. Further investigation and management are necessary to address this issue.
4. Chronic abdominal pain: The patient's chronic abdominal pain is likely related to her underlying condition. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this issue.
5. Groin pain: The patient's new groin pain is likely related to the sepsis or a secondary complication. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this issue.
6. Electrolyte and fluid imbalance: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance are being monitored closely, but further management is necessary to prevent complications.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to her sepsis and anemia. Further management is necessary to address this issue.
8. Pain control: The patient's pain control is being managed with medication, but further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure adequate pain relief.
9. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient's CVA is a potential complication of her sepsis. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this issue.
10. Vascular access complications: The patient's vascular access lines are at risk for complications, such as bleeding, infection, or thrombosis. Close monitoring and regular dressing changes are necessary to prevent these complications."
