   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   #Hypotension/Bradycardia/Somnolence - Presentation with hypotension and
   bradycardia most likely [**12-26**] propranolol vs seroquel overdose, unclear
   if intentional or accidental at this time.   He appears to respond well
   to IV glucagon given in the ED making propranolol more likely however
   alpha antagonistic properties of seroquel could also be responsible.
   Per toxicology reccs would continue on glucagon gtt.  Other possible
   cause of current presentation could be sepsis, with pulmonary source
   most likely, although less likely than overdose at this time as no
   prodrome or infectious symptoms preceeding presentation according to
   his partner.
   -start glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hour
   -can use calcium gluc as needed for hypotension while awaiting glucagon
   gtt
   -insulin sq vs gtt as needed for hyperglycemia
   -monitor QRS for prolongation
   -continue levophed as needed for MAP >65/adequate urine output
   -continue with IVF as also appears to be dehydrated
   -appreciate tox reccs
   -psych/social work/addiction consult when awake
   -infectious workup with UA/UCX, blood cx, sputum cx
   .
   #Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   -bronch today to eval for aspirated material and to send sputum
   cultures
   -treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   -f/u cultures
   -hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   -check urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse - Has been sober for years however recently started
   drinking per partner.
   -bananna bag
   -ranitidine for GI protection
   -addiction consult once awake
   -monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> on versed gtt but may require valium
   for longer acting coverage
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   -monitor creatinine
   -IVF
   -avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   -send urine lytes
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   -guaiac stools
   -check b12/folate levels
   -folate supplementation
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will likely need large upfront bolus of 20 IV and will
   rpt as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   Already greatly improved and nearly resolved.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   - Send urine electrolytes
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will likely need large upfront bolus of 20 IV and will
   rpt as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   Already greatly improved and nearly resolved.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   - Send urine electrolytes
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or transient right mainstem intubation.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardic and hypotensive, with a possible etiology of ethanol withdrawal and inadequate sedation.
* Neurological: Sedated and intubated, with pinpoint pupils but equal and reactive.
* Gastrointestinal: Slightly distended abdomen, with no evidence of tenderness or bleeding.
* Renal: Acute renal failure likely due to prerenal causes, with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.3 mg/dL.
* Hematological: Anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency or ethanol abuse, with a baseline HCT of 40%.
* Metabolic: Acidosis likely due to chronic respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory acidosis, and acute metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis due to the patient's respiratory condition.
* Ethanol withdrawal syndrome, which may lead to seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
* Pancreatitis, which may be caused by hypotension-induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs, or other etiologies.
* Acute kidney injury or acute renal failure, which may be due to prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal causes.
* Anemia, which may be due to nutritional deficiency, ethanol abuse, or other causes.
* Metabolic acidosis, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and decreased cardiac output.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, which may be due to the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular instability.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Weaning off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.
* Transitioning off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.
* Bronchoscopy to rule out aspiration of foreign material.
* Levofloxacin and Unasyn to cover for aspiration.
* Hydration to improve gas exchange and VQ matching.
* Hold TF and make NPO.
* Transition off Propofol.
* Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
* Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the worse.
* Continue to fluid resuscitate.
* Monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate.
* Bananna bag.
* Ranitidine for GI protection.
* Addiction consult and social work once awake.
* Monitor for ETOH withdrawal.
* Transition to Diazepam with strong front loading.
* Monitor Creatinine.
* IVF.
* Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all meds.
* Send urine electrolytes.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hematological, and metabolic conditions to prevent potential complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is mechanically ventilated, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 35 cmH2O and a plateau pressure of 27 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95%, and their partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 126 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 160/87 mmHg, and their heart rate is 95 beats per minute (bpm). The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 58 mg/dL.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, as they are not assessed for movement, tone, or responsiveness.
* Metabolic: The patient has hypoglycemia, with a glucose level of 58 mg/dL, and acidosis, with a bicarbonate level of 19 mmol/L.
* Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection, with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.8 K/uL and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6.7 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, leading to respiratory failure.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis.
* Sepsis: The patient's high risk of infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to neurological damage or even death.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac complications.
* Acidosis: The patient's acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
* Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Administer antibiotics to prevent and treat infections.
* Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and administer insulin as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and administer medications as necessary to prevent hypertension.
* Monitor the patient's acid-base status closely and administer medications as necessary to prevent acidosis.
* Consider consultation with a nephrologist and an infectious disease specialist to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: Femoral line, PIVs

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel.

   (1000).
   CXR--ET ok, lung fields without focal process
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal which is limiting ability
   to wean and extubate at this time (remains on propofol gtt with high
   valium needs/agitation). Continue PSW.  Treat ETOH withdrawal with
   valium and versed. Continue B12, thimine, folate.   Continue broad
   antibiotic coverage with levoflox and unasyn x 48 hours
would taper
   once final cx/speciation available. Chemical pancreatitis improving,
   likely [**12-26**] etoh. Will wean propofol  and check
   triglycerides. Continue NPO.  Will hold off on imaging for now and
   start bowel regimen.  ARF has improved. SW eval and psych c/s post
   extubation. Will attempt picc line and then d/c femoral CVL.  If unable
   to get picc will continue fem line for now as high risk for neck line
   given agitation/inability to cooperate.  Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: Femoral line, PIVs

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel.

   CXR--ET ok, lung fields without focal process
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal which is limiting ability
   to wean and extubate at this time (remains on propofol gtt with high
   valium needs/agitation). Continue PSW.  Treat ETOH withdrawal with
   valium and versed. Continue B12, thimine, folate.   Continue broad
   antibiotic coverage with levoflox and unasyn x 48 hours
would taper
   once final cx/speciation available. Chemical pancreatitis improving,
   likely [**12-26**] etoh. Will wean propofol  and check
   triglycerides. Continue NPO.  Will hold off on imaging for now and
   start bowel regimen.  ARF has improved. SW eval and psych c/s post
   extubation. Will attempt picc line and then d/c femoral CVL.  If unable
   to get picc will continue fem line for now as high risk for neck line
   given agitation/inability to cooperate.  Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.
   Patient is critically ill

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. He has a history of alcoholism and depression.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and ventilated, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardic with a heart rate of 73-118 beats per minute, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 120/57-184/105 mmHg.
* Neurological: Sedated and intubated, with pinpoint but equal and reactive pupils.
* Gastrointestinal: Slightly distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and no apparent tenderness.
* Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved with IV fluid resuscitation, likely pre-renal.
* Hematological: Anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse, with no evidence of bleeding.
* Pancreatic: Chemical pancreatitis improving, likely due to ETOH.

The patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

* ETOH withdrawal syndrome, which may exacerbate his current condition and lead to agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia.
* Respiratory failure, which may worsen his hypoxia and require increased ventilator support.
* Infection, particularly pneumonia, which may develop due to his aspiration event and prolonged intubation.
* Pancreatitis, which may worsen his abdominal pain and lead to complications such as abscesses or sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury, which may recur if his renal function does not improve.
* Malnutrition, which may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.
* Transitioning to tube feeds once his respiratory status improves.
* Monitoring his electrolyte levels and adjusting his fluid management accordingly.
* Continuing broad antibiotic coverage for 48 hours, with plans to taper once final cultures are available.
* Managing his ETOH withdrawal with valium and versed.
* Continuing supportive care, including respiratory and cardiovascular support.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will likely need large upfront bolus of 20 IV and will
   rpt as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - baseline creatinine 1-1.3 according to records.
   Most likely [**12-26**] prerenal given recent ETOH abuse, likely dehydrated.
   Already greatly improved and nearly resolved.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   - Send urine electrolytes

   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis vs. aspiration pneumonia. He is also experiencing hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation, likely due to ethanol withdrawal.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis, with elevated lipase and amylase levels, and anemia, with a borderline macrocytic anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency and ethanol abuse.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a respiratory rate of 15-31 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 143. His ABG results show a pH of 7.43, with a bicarbonate level of 41 mmol/L.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a blood pressure of 120/57 mmHg and a heart rate of 73 beats per minute. His electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, with a plan to start tube feeds once his condition improves.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying respiratory disease and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is a risk of cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac disease and the use of vasopressors.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis and anemia, which may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of renal failure due to his underlying kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal status is being closely monitored, but there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying gastrointestinal disease and the use of anticoagulant medications.
6. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis and anemia, which may increase his risk of developing an infection.
7. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing ethanol withdrawal, which may lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation, which is likely due to ethanol withdrawal in the setting of long-term ethanol abuse and inadequate sedation while intubated.

The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which is likely aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with levofloxacin and Unasyn to cover for aspiration, and his lipase is trending downward.

The patient has pancreatitis, which may be due to ethanol, hypotension-induced ischemic insult, or effects of drugs such as propofol or propranolol. His lipase is trending downward, and he is being monitored for abdominal tenderness and changes in clinical status.

The patient has acidosis, which is likely a component of chronic respiratory acidosis with superimposed acute respiratory acidosis and acute metabolic acidosis.

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, and his partner endorses that he has been sober for years, but recently fell off the wagon. The patient is being monitored for ethanol withdrawal and is being transitioned to Diazepam with strong front loading.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely pre-renal, and is being monitored for creatinine levels and treated with IV fluids.

The patient has anemia, which is likely due to nutritional deficiency and ethanol abuse. He is being monitored for bleeding and is being treated with supplements.

The patient has a femoral line and PIVs, and is being treated with antibiotics for aspiration.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Multi-organ failure
* Ethanol withdrawal syndrome
* Pancreatitis
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Anemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypophosphatemia

The patient's current condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while
   intuabed.  Patient required large amounts of valium last night to treat
   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated, on CPAP/PSV with a SpO2 of 96%, and a RSBI of 39.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardic, with a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 120/57 mmHg.
* Neurological: Sedated, intubated, and not responding to verbal commands.
* Gastrointestinal: Slightly distended abdomen, with decreased bowel sounds, and no apparent tenderness.
* Renal: Anemia, with a baseline HCT of 40, and a current HCT of 31.7.
* Pancreatic: Elevated lipase levels, with a trend downward.
* Metabolic: Acidosis, with a pH of 7.43, and a lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Hypertension, which is likely due to ETOH withdrawal and inadequate sedation while intubated.
* Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which may be due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
* Pancreatitis, with multiple possible etiologies, including ETOH, hypotension-induced ischemic insult, and effects of drugs.
* Acute renal failure, which has resolved with IVF.
* Anemia, likely due to nutritional deficiency and ETOH abuse.
* ETOH withdrawal, which is being treated with Diazepam and other medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.
* Bronchoscopy to rule out aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
* Treatment with levofloxacin and Unasyn to cover for aspiration.
* Hydration to improve gas exchange and VQ matching.
* Holding TF and making NPO to manage pancreatitis.
* Transitioning off Propofol and monitoring lipase and serial abdominal exams.
* Considering CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the worse.
* Continuing fluid resuscitation to manage acidosis.
* Monitoring ABG and adjusting vent settings as appropriate.
* Adding ranitidine for GI protection and considering addiction consult and social work once awake.
* Monitoring for ETOH withdrawal and transitioning to Diazepam with strong front loading.
* Monitoring creatinine and avoiding nephrotoxins and renally dosing all medications.
* Checking b12 and folate levels and supplementing as necessary.
* Starting tube feeds and repleting lytes as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued hypertension and tachycardia, which could lead to cardiac complications.
* Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, which could worsen respiratory status.
* Pancreatitis, which could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
* ETOH withdrawal, which could lead to seizures, hallucinations, or other complications.
* Acute renal failure, which could worsen kidney function.
* Anemia, which could worsen with continued bleeding or inadequate nutrition.
* Infection, which could worsen respiratory or other organ dysfunction."

   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  likely due to ETOH withdrawal in
   the setting of long term ETOH abuse and inadequate sedation while

   agitation and withdrawal.  Unable to completely wean off propofol,
   though it was reduced.  Also started on low dose metoprolol given
   possibility of propranolol withdrawal complicating the picture
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, ?overdose
   Stopped Valium, getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol
   given high triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning and increased Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   fighting the vent, put on PCV

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, was admitted to the ICU with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing prolonged expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates, which is concerning for possible derecruitment or oversedation. He has been receiving high doses of sedation, including midazolam and fentanyl, and is currently on propofol.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, for which he is receiving treatment with levofloxacin and Unasyn.
2. Pancreatitis, possibly caused by ethanol, hypotension-induced ischemic insult, or effects of drugs (propofol or propranolol), for which he is being treated with hydration and lipase monitoring.
3. Acidosis, likely due to chronic respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory acidosis, and acute metabolic acidosis, for which he is being treated with fluid resuscitation and ABG monitoring.
4. ETOH withdrawal, for which he is being treated with Diazepam and ranitidine.
5. Anemia, likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse, for which he is being treated with guaiac stools and B12/folate level monitoring.
6. Acute Renal Failure, which has resolved with IVF and is being monitored.
7. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation, likely due to ETOH withdrawal, for which he is being treated with Diazepam and metoprolol.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) - 10 mg/hour
* Fentanyl
* Propofol
* Diazepam (Valium) - 20-30 mg IV as needed
* Levofloxacin
* Unasyn
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Metoprolol

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm
* Blood pressure: 149/68 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's lab results include:

* White blood cell count: 6.2-8.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5-12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 190-212 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.0 mg/dL
* Lipase: 163-147 IU/L
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 282 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal
* Bronchoscopy to evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia
* Hydration to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
* Monitoring of lipase and serial abdominal exams for pancreatitis
* Consideration of CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the worse
* Addiction consult and social work once awake
* Monitoring for ETOH withdrawal and transitioning to Diazepam with strong front loading."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, upwards of 500mg IV in 24 hours and
   there was a question of benzodiazepine overdose.  Valium was stopped.
   Pt was getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol given high
   triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning, pt received Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   breath-stacking, not able to be put on PS because was breathing at a
   rate of [**3-31**] and large tidal volumes, becoming hypercarbic.  Pt was put
   on pressure control ventilation at a set rate of 14.
   At 2am all sedation turned off, by 4am Versed titrated up and small
   amounts of Fentanyl given.  Got Zyprexa X 1 this morning for agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to pancreatitis.
   Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: Femoral line, PIVs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to pancreatitis.
   Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Transition off propofol and midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation
   and withdrawal.  Will increase standing dose to 20-30 mg IV and will
   repeat as needed to achieve appropriate sedation.
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  He is currently intubated however
   hypoxic on arrival most likely [**12-26**] pneumonitis vs. transient right
   mainstem intubation.  Mucous plug also possible although minimal
   secretions on suctioning.
   - Bronchoscopy = benign for aspirated material and will f/u sputum
   cultures.
   - Treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   - Hydrate to improve gas exchange/VQ matching
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Many possible etiologies that include EtOH, hypotension
   induced ischemic insult, effects of drugs (i.e. propofol or
   propranolol).  Lipase trending downward.
   - Hold TF and make NPO.
   - Transition off Propofol.
   - Trend Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
   - Check triglycerides
   - Consider CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the
   worse.
   .
   # Acidosis
 likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with
   superimposed acute respiratory acidosis as well as acute metabolic
   acidosis [**12-26**] ARF.
   -continue to fluid resuscitate
   -monitor ABG and adjust vent settings as appropriate
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Bananna bag
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal -> transitioning to Diazepam with strong
   front loading.
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - IVF
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Check b12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
   .
   #FEN - NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near
   extubation today, replete lytes prn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. The patient has a history of alcoholism, depression, and pancreatitis.

The patient received a large dose of Valium (500mg IV) in 24 hours, which was stopped due to suspicion of benzodiazepine overdose. The patient was also given Versed and Fentanyl to wean off Propofol due to high triglycerides. However, the patient developed prolonged expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates, which was treated with pressure control ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.2°C, Heart rate 88 bpm, Blood pressure 149/68 mmHg, Respiratory rate 15 inspirations per minute, Oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 6.2, Hct 33.2, Platelet count 190, Creatinine 1.1, Glucose 83, and other lab results are within normal limits.
* Physical examination: The patient is sedated, intubated, and not responding to verbal commands. He has decreased breath sounds at the right base, and his abdomen is slightly distended.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: possibly due to EtOH withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness.
* Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: likely aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration PNA.
* Pancreatitis: possibly due to EtOH, hypotension-induced ischemic insult, or effects of drugs (i.e., Propofol or propranolol).
* Acidosis: likely component of chronic respiratory acidosis with superimposed acute respiratory acidosis and acute metabolic acidosis.
* ETOH Abuse: patient's partner endorses that the patient has been sober for years, but the extent of his withdrawal suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more extensive.
* Anemia: likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse.
* Acute Renal Failure: resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Weaning off vent as soon as possible.
* Transitioning off Propofol and Midazolam for Diazepam to treat agitation and withdrawal.
* Bronchoscopy to rule out aspiration pneumonitis or PNA.
* Treatment with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration.
* Hydration to improve gas exchange/VQ matching.
* Holding TF and making NPO.
* Trending Lipase and serial abdominal exams.
* Checking triglycerides.
* Considering CT abdomen if symptoms or clinical status changes for the worse.
* Continuing to fluid resuscitate.
* Monitoring ABG and adjusting vent settings as appropriate.
* Transitioning to Diazepam with strong front loading for ETOH withdrawal.
* Monitoring Creatinine.
* IVF.
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and renally dosing all meds.
* Guaiac stools.
* Checking B12/folate levels with appropriate supplementations.
* NPO for now, likely will start tube feeds as patient not near extubation today, replete lytes prn.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment plan include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged expiratory phase breathing.
* Pneumonia or aspiration PNA due to aspiration event.
* Pancreatitis or worsening of pancreatitis due to continued use of Propofol or other medications.
* ETOH withdrawal or benzo withdrawal symptoms.
* Anemia or worsening of anemia due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse.
* Acute Renal Failure or worsening of acute Renal Failure due to continued use of nephrotoxins or renally dosed medications.
* Acidosis or worsening of acidosis due to continued use of medications that can cause acidosis.
* Infection or sepsis due to aspiration event or other medical conditions.
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension or hypertension.
* Neurological complications due to prolonged sedation or use of medications that can cause neurological side effects."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, upwards of 500mg IV in 24 hours and
   there was a question of benzodiazepine overdose.  Valium was stopped.
   Pt was getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol given high
   triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning, pt received Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   breath-stacking, not able to be put on PS because was breathing at a
   rate of [**3-31**] and large tidal volumes, becoming hypercarbic.  Pt was put
   on pressure control ventilation at a set rate of 14.
   At 2am all sedation turned off, by 4am Versed titrated up and small
   amounts of Fentanyl given.  Got Zyprexa X 1 this morning for agitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to pancreatitis.
   Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - continue Midazolam and Fentanyl for sedation
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material and will f/u sputum cultures.  Sputum from BAL growing coag +
   staph, unclear if significant.
   - Continue to treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase trending downward.  Possibly due to Propofol with
   increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that Propofol is decreased
   and discontinued however unclear relationship.  Abdomen somewhat firm
   but not tense.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - will restart tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal, pt got large doses of IV Diazepam
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #FEN
 start tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis, replete
   lytes prn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 149/68 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on 60% FiO2.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a prolonged expiratory phase breathing and large tidal volumes, leading to hypercarbia. The patient is currently on pressure control ventilation with a set rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis, with a lipase trending downward. The patient's abdominal examination is significant for slight distension and tenderness.

The patient's medical history is significant for alcoholism, depression, and pancreatitis. The patient's social history is significant for recent relapse of alcohol use, which may be contributing to his current condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off propofol and sedation
* Continuing midazolam and fentanyl for sedation
* Treating bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia with levofloxacin and unasyn
* Restarting tube feeds slowly
* Monitoring for ETOH withdrawal
* Managing acute renal failure with IVF and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Trending anemia and monitoring for bleeding
* Starting tube feeds today and repleting electrolytes as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged expiratory phase breathing and hypercarbia
* Pancreatitis exacerbation due to continued inflammation and infection
* ETOH withdrawal syndrome
* Acute renal failure due to nephrotoxin exposure or pre-renal causes
* Anemia exacerbation due to continued bleeding or nutritional deficiency
* Infection due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent these complications and promote the patient's recovery."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Recieved a lot of Valium yesterday, upwards of 500mg IV in 24 hours and
   there was a question of benzodiazepine overdose.  Valium was stopped.
   Pt was getting Versed and started Fentanyl to wean Propofol given high
   triglycerides
   Propofol weaned off
   During turning, pt received Fentanyl boluses, began to have prolonged
   expiratory phase breathing with large tidal volumes and low rates,
   ?derecruitment vs oversedation, not able to tolerate AC as pt was
   breath-stacking, not able to be put on PS because was breathing at a
   rate of [**3-31**] and large tidal volumes, becoming hypercarbic.  Pt was put
   on pressure control ventilation at a set rate of 14.
   At 2am all sedation turned off, by 4am Versed titrated up and small
   amounts of Fentanyl given.  Got Zyprexa X 1 this morning for agitation.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel. As
   triglycerides elevated attempted  to wean propofol to off and
   converting to fentanyl/versed--> RR slowed, dysycnchronous with vent
   with prolonged exp phase and breath stacking
 changed to PCV. Concerned
   also for valium/benzo intoxication

   Micro:  sputum speciation pending, urine/bl ngtd
   CXR--ET ok, lung fields without focal process, no sig change
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal as well as concern for
   benzo intoxication given very high valium doses over prior few days.
   These issues are largely holding up ability to wean/extubate. Agitation
   now better controlled on current doses of fentanyl and versed.  Given
   high triglycerides
propofol is now off. Will consult psych service for
   additional suggestions. Continue B12, thiamine, folate.  Tolerated
   change to PS this am and now overbreathing vent
 will switch back to
   PSV and follow abgs/sats.  Continue broad antibiotic coverage with
   levoflox and unasyn
will taper once final cx data and speciation
   available. Chemical pancreatitis resolved, likely [**12-26**] etoh. Will
   start TFs and decrease then d/c IVF.  Will follow A/L..  SW eval post

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to pancreatitis.
   Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - continue Midazolam and Fentanyl for sedation
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material and will f/u sputum cultures.  Sputum from BAL growing coag +
   staph, unclear if significant.
   - Continue to treat with levofloxacin/unasyn to cover for aspiration
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase trending downward.  Possibly due to Propofol with
   increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that Propofol is decreased
   and discontinued however unclear relationship.  Abdomen somewhat firm
   but not tense.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - will restart tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal, pt got large doses of IV Diazepam
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #FEN
 start tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis, replete
   lytes prn

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55 yo M EtOH, depression, HTN p/w altered
   mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, ARF and respiratory failure in
   setting of ETOH and overdose of propranolol / seroquel. As
   triglycerides elevated attempted  to wean propofol to off and
   converting to fentanyl/versed--> RR slowed, dysycnchronous with vent
   with prolonged exp phase and breath stacking
 changed to PCV. Concerned
   also for valium/benzo intoxication
 d/c'd valium.

   Micro:  sputum speciation pending, urine/bl ngtd
   CXR--ET ok, lung fields without focal process, no sig change
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care. MS remains poor and is
   easily agitated largely from etoh withdrawal as well as concern for
   benzo intoxication given very high valium doses over prior few days.
   These issues are largely holding up ability to wean/extubate. Agitation
   now better controlled on current doses of fentanyl and versed.  Given
   high triglycerides
propofol is now off. Will consult psych service for
   additional suggestions. Continue B12, thiamine, folate.  Tolerated
   change to PS this am and now overbreathing vent
 will switch back to
   PSV and follow abgs/sats.  Continue broad antibiotic coverage with
   levoflox and unasyn
will taper once final cx data and speciation
   available. Chemical pancreatitis resolved, likely [**12-26**] etoh. Will
   start TFs and decrease then d/c IVF.  Will follow A/L..  SW eval post
   extubation. Will attempt picc line and then d/c femoral
   CVL.   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Summary:

The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, was admitted to the ICU after a likely benzodiazepine overdose and aspiration event. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient received a large dose of Valium, which was stopped, and was started on Fentanyl and Versed for sedation. He was also receiving Levofloxacin and Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and anemia. He has been sedated and paralyzed due to his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with a prolonged expiratory phase and breath stacking. He is at risk for further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely related to his benzodiazepine overdose and aspiration event. He is at risk for further complications, including pancreatic necrosis and sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to his pancreatitis and aspiration event. He is at risk for further complications, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to his chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. He is at risk for further complications, including bleeding and cardiovascular events.
5. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient has received a large dose of Valium, which has been stopped. He is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, and seizures.
6. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcoholism and has been sober for years. However, he has recently relapsed and is at risk for EtOH withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, tremors, and seizures.
7. Infection: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia are concerning and may indicate cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and sedation. The patient will be weaned off the ventilator as soon as possible, and he will be started on tube feeds and repleted with electrolytes as needed. The patient will also receive broad antibiotic coverage with Levofloxacin and Unasyn, and he will be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's EtOH withdrawal symptoms will be managed with medication, and he will be evaluated for possible benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. The patient's anemia will be managed with blood transfusions as needed, and his pancreatitis will be managed with supportive care and possible surgical intervention."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, was admitted to the ICU after an episode of acute agitation, likely due to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or other toxic ingestions. He presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension, as well as bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been managed with midazolam and fentanyl for sedation, and has been treated with levofloxacin and Unasyn to cover for aspiration.

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which is trending downward, and has been managed with tube feeds and IV fluids. He has also been treated for acute renal failure, which has resolved with IV fluids, and has been monitored for signs of ETOH withdrawal.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation, which are being managed with medications. He has also been treated for anemia, which is likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient has a history of alcoholism and has recently stopped drinking, which may lead to withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which may be due to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which may recur if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Agitation: The patient has agitation, which may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's ETOH withdrawal syndrome with medications.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pancreatitis with tube feeds and IV fluids.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with iron supplements and folic acid.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely and consider medication adjustments if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's agitation closely and consider medication adjustments if necessary.
8. Consider consulting a pulmonologist or gastroenterologist for further management of the patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl.
   Appreciate recs from psychiatry
   - Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - continue Midazolam and Fentanyl for sedation, trying to wean off
   midazolam as possible
   - ABG and EKG with next hypertensive episode to rule out respiratory &
   cardiac causes
   - Haldol 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with 2.5 mg prn for agitation
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material and will f/u sputum cultures.  Sputum from BAL growing coag +
   staph, unclear if significant.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - stop levofloxacin ([**10-4**])
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. to advance tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal, pt got large doses of IV Diazepam
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, who presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. He has received large amounts of sedation and is currently managed with midazolam and fentanyl. The patient has developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has pancreatitis, which is trending downward, and acute renal failure, which has resolved with IV fluid therapy. The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is at risk for withdrawal, and is being monitored for signs of withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzo toxicity: The patient has received large amounts of midazolam and may be experiencing paradoxical agitation, which could worsen his condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and pancreatitis may lead to sepsis, which could worsen his condition and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Renal failure: The patient's history of acute renal failure and continued use of nephrotoxic medications may lead to further renal damage.
5. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and recent intoxication may lead to withdrawal symptoms, which could worsen his condition and increase the risk of mortality.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen and lead to further complications, such as abscesses or fistulas.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen and lead to further complications, such as cardiovascular instability or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's sedation regimen to minimize the risk of benzo toxicity.
3. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia and pancreatitis with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen to avoid nephrotoxic medications.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of ETOH withdrawal and provide supportive care as needed.
6. Continue to trend the patient's pancreatitis and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
7. Consider consulting a specialist, such as a nephrologist or gastroenterologist, to further evaluate and manage the patient's conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU with polysubstance ingestion, including Seroquel and Propranolol. He has had continued high requirements for benzodiazepine dosing and persistent respiratory failure with paroxysms of tachycardia/tachypnea with respiratory distress and recurrent episodes.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 153/78 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 10 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a PICC line placed, and his sputum culture is positive for MSSA, with Legionella negative. He has received antibiotics, including Levofloxacin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 212 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 93 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: normal
* Liver enzymes: mildly elevated
* Amylase and lipase: elevated
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 282 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT, are unremarkable.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, hypertension, and mixed acidosis.
* The patient will be weaned off benzodiazepines and started on alternative medications for alcohol withdrawal.
* He will receive nutritional support with tube feeds and glycemic control with insulin.
* Prophylactic measures will be taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* The patient will undergo regular monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated complications
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* Pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis
* Seizures and status epilepticus
* Delirium and altered mental status
* Hypertension and cardiac complications
* Infection and sepsis
* Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis
* Electrolyte imbalances and hypocalcemia
* Liver dysfunction and failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old neonate with an unknown origin fever, hypertension, and mixed acidosis. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a history of respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/80 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV mode with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's unknown origin fever and mixed acidosis increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or need for more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to end-organ damage, particularly in the kidneys and brain.
4. Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to receive oral nutrition and potential gastrointestinal issues could lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in protein, calories, and electrolytes.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's nasogastric tube and potential gastrointestinal issues could lead to complications such as aspiration, necrotizing enterocolitis, or bowel perforation.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory support and potential gastrointestinal issues could increase the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac issues could lead to hemodynamic instability, particularly if the patient's blood pressure becomes too high or too low.
9. Neurological issues: The patient's mixed acidosis and potential hypoxia could lead to neurological issues, particularly seizures or brain injury.
10. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac issues could lead to cardiovascular issues, particularly if the patient's blood pressure becomes too high or too low."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of ethanol abuse and polysubstance ingestion, including Seroquel and Propranolol. The patient has been experiencing persistent respiratory failure, paroxysms of tachycardia/tachypnea, and recurrent respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/80 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and hypertension. The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, and the patient is receiving tube feeds and continued monitoring of amylase and lipase levels.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, and the plan is to continue with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and to wean the patient off the ventilator. The patient's mental status is altered, and the plan is to continue with psychological support.

The patient's antibiotic regimen includes levofloxacin, which will be discontinued and replaced with Unasyn for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and altered mental status increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Delirium tremens: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and polysubstance ingestion increases the risk of delirium tremens.
4. Seizures: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and polysubstance ingestion increases the risk of seizures.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure increases the risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis increases the risk of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression who was admitted to the ICU after a likely intoxication and aspiration event. He is intubated and sedated, with a heart rate of 92 bpm and a blood pressure of 151/80 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 97% on 50% FiO2, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. His abdomen is slightly distended, and he has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, with a trend downward in lipase levels. He is receiving tube feeds and has a PIV and PICC line in place. His creatinine level has resolved, and he is being monitored for ETOH withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of extensive ETOH use and recent relapse may lead to severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates may progress to pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as abscess formation, sepsis, or pancreatic necrosis.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's pre-renal acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to stress.
6. Infection: The patient's presence of MSSA in his bronchoscopy sample may lead to a systemic infection, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's presence of a PICC line and history of ETOH use may increase his risk of developing a venous thromboembolism.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of pancreatitis and ETOH use may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or need for mechanical ventilation.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or need for vasopressor support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted with intoxication and concern for polysubstance ingestion, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He required intubation and has had recurrent agitation, which has responded to changes in antipsychotic and narcotic dosing. He has a fever, hypertension, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. His neurological examination is concerning for a possible CNS insult.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying condition and the use of sedating medications.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's fever is of unknown origin and may be related to his underlying condition or a secondary infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely related to his underlying condition and may be contributing to his subconjunctival hemorrhage.
4. Subconjunctival Hemorrhage: The patient's subconjunctival hemorrhage is a concerning finding and may be related to his hypertension or other underlying conditions.
5. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his sedating medications.
6. Mixed Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis is likely related to his underlying condition and may be contributing to his respiratory failure.
7. CNS Insult: The patient's neurological examination is concerning for a possible CNS insult, which may be related to his underlying condition or a secondary complication.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's fever with antipyretics and antibiotics as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive medications as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedating medications as needed.
5. Consider repeating the patient's head CT scan to evaluate for any changes in his CNS insult.
6. Consider evaluating the patient for other potential causes of his fever, such as a secondary infection.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust his medications as needed to manage his mixed acidosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and diuretics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/72 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 689 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acidosis, with a pH of 7.07, bicarbonate of 12.1 mmol/L, and base excess of -15.3 mmol/L. The patient's white blood cell count is 7.0 K/uL, and the platelet count is 225 K/uL.

The patient's respiratory support is being provided through a endotracheal tube, and the patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on 50% FiO2.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever of unknown origin and acidosis, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and acidosis may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's acidosis and hypotension may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Renal complications: The patient's acidosis and hypotension may lead to renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support to prevent these potential complications and optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with standing Haldol and seems
   to be responsive to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent.
   - continue Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, wean as possible
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u cultures

   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.

   #ETOH Abuse

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent today
   - continue Haldol sedation
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - psych to see and re-eval once extubated
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u [**10-1**] BCx
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - try to feed PO today if patient tolerates
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
 re-check electrolytes in afternoon
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding. Currently stable
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of alcoholism and depression, who presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with Haldol for agitation, and his sedation is being managed with standing and PRN doses.

The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coagulopathy, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient has pancreatitis, with a trending-down lipase level, possibly due to ethanol or propofol. His abdomen is somewhat firm but not tense, and he is tolerating tube feeds.

The patient has a history of ETOH abuse, and his partner reports that he has been sober for years but recently relapsed. He is being monitored for ETOH withdrawal and will receive addiction consult and social work services once awake.

The patient has acute renal failure, which has resolved with IVF, likely due to pre-renal causes. He will be monitored for creatinine and electrolytes.

The patient has anemia, which is likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse. He is being monitored and will receive thiamine daily.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis can worsen and lead to complications such as necrosis, abscesses, or fistulas.
4. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and recent relapse increase his risk of developing ETOH withdrawal syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen and lead to complications such as heart failure, angina, or infection.
6. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can recur, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremia.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation can fail, leading to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension can worsen and lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  However, the patient has received a large amount of valium
   over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a
   paradoxical response.  Pt not able to tolerate Propofol due to
   pancreatitis.  Currently being managed with standing Haldol and seems
   to be responsive to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent.
   - continue Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, wean as possible
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #FEN
 advance tube feeds today slowly given recent pancreatitis,
   replete lytes prn, thiamine daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - continue Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, wean as possible
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - f/u psychiatry recs
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - Cont. tube feeds slowly
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear

 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. The patient has been managed with standing Haldol and Fentanyl for sedation, and the goal is to wean off the vent.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Benzo toxicity: The patient has received a large amount of Valium over the weekend and may now be suffering from benzo toxicity with a paradoxical response.
2. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which is trending downward, but the relationship with EtOH or Propofol is unclear.
4. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's partner endorses that the patient has been sober for years, but the extent of his withdrawal suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more extensive.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has resolved acute renal failure, but the cause is unclear.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely due to nutritional deficiency or ETOH abuse.
7. FEN: The patient has FEN, which is advancing tube feeds slowly given recent pancreatitis.
8. VAP: The patient has VAP, which is being managed with a VAP bundle.

The patient's current medications include:

* Haldol 2.5mg PO q6H
* Fentanyl 50 mcg/hour
* Lasix 10mg IV qAM, 20mg IV qPM, 40mg IV this morning

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with admission with intoxication and sepsis now with
   persistent delirium and now with change in medications and minimization
   of benzodiazepine dosing patient has shown substantial improvement in
   mental status.  He has had haldol at 2.5mg q 6 hours and effective
   diuresis in past 24 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Move to extubation with favorable SBT this morning
   -A-line D/C'd
   -Will need close chest PT and suctioning post extubation to maintain
   airway patency
   -IN addition, patient has a respiratory acidosis on ABG which does
   appear to be compensated by his metabolic status with HCO3-=36.  This
   is likely a combination of central suppression with sedation and
   contraction alkalosis also contributing
   -Will continue with PSV at 5/5 for now and move to extubation
   -Patient will need continued support post extubation
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -Haldol standing and PRN
   -Avoid benzodiazepines if at all possible
   -Will return to outpatient psychiatry medications following inpatient
   evaluation and use haldol
   -Will need sitter and 1:1 following extubation
   3)Pancreatitis-
   -Propofol off
   -po feeds to return with safe extubation
   -Enzymes decreasing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with admission with intoxication and sepsis now with
   persistent delirium and now with change in medications and minimization
   of benzodiazepine dosing patient has shown substantial improvement in
   mental status.  He has had haldol at 2.5mg q 6 hours and effective
   diuresis in past 24 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Move to extubation with favorable SBT this morning
   -A-line D/C'd
   -Will need close chest PT and suctioning post extubation to maintain
   airway patency
   -IN addition, patient has a respiratory acidosis on ABG which does
   appear to be compensated by his metabolic status with HCO3-=36.  This
   is likely a combination of central suppression with sedation and
   contraction alkalosis also contributing
   -Will continue with PSV at 5/5 for now and move to extubation
   -Patient will need continued support post extubation
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -Haldol standing and PRN
   -Avoid benzodiazepines if at all possible
   -Will return to outpatient psychiatry medications following inpatient
   evaluation and use haldol
   -Will need sitter and 1:1 following extubation
   3)Pancreatitis-
   -Propofol off
   -po feeds to return with safe extubation
   -Enzymes decreasing

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ingestion, respiratory failure, and sepsis. The patient has shown improvement in mental status after minimizing benzodiazepine dosing and initiation of haloperidol. The patient's respiratory status is also improving, with a plan to extubate him with favorable spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and close chest physical therapy and suctioning post-extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium if not managed with continued use of haloperidol and avoidance of benzodiazepines.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess, or sepsis.
4. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's fever may be a sign of underlying infection or inflammation, which may require further investigation and management.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further cardiovascular complications.
6. Mixed acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory and metabolic complications.
7. Post-extubation respiratory failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure after extubation if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient will require close monitoring and management in the ICU, including:

1. Continued respiratory support with PSV at 5/5 and close chest physical therapy and suctioning post-extubation.
2. Ongoing management of delirium with haloperidol and avoidance of benzodiazepines.
3. Continued management of pancreatitis with propofol off and po feeds to return with safe extubation.
4. Investigation and management of FUO with further laboratory tests and imaging studies as needed.
5. Management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Management of mixed acidosis with further respiratory and metabolic support as needed.
7. Post-extubation respiratory failure prophylaxis with close monitoring and respiratory support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission who self-extubated and was subsequently reintubated. They are currently agitated and have been restrained for agitation. The patient has a fever of 101.2°F and has undergone various medical interventions, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and vasopressors. Their vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 174/109 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acidosis, with a pH of 7.42, bicarbonate of 33 mEq/L, and lactate of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, acute, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and acidosis, there is a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation make them susceptible to VAP, which can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient's PICC line increases the risk of CRBSI, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension can lead to hypertensive crisis, which can cause end-organ damage and acute kidney injury.
5. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications, including respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, self-extubation, and respiratory compromise.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and poor oral intake increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Wound complications: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of wound complications, including pressure ulcers and surgical site infections.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and addressing these potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration and improve their outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent today
   - continue Haldol sedation
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - psych to see and re-[**Month/Day (2) **] once extubated
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u [**10-1**] BCx
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - try to feed PO today if patient tolerates
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to [**Month/Day (4) **] pt. once he is awake and clear
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure
 Resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
   - Monitor Creatinine
 re-check electrolytes in afternoon
   - Avoid nephrotoxins/renally dose all meds
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this.
   - Goal is to wean off vent today
   - continue Haldol sedation
   - changed Haldol to 2.5mg PO q 6hours
   - psych to see and re-[**Month/Day (2) **] once extubated
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - F/u [**10-1**] BCx
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to hold Propofol.
   - continue to trend lipase
   - try to feed PO today if patient tolerates
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to [**Month/Day (4) **] pt. once he is awake and clear

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient, a 55-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.
* The patient's condition has been managed with standing and PRN Haldol, and he has been responsive to this treatment.
* The patient's laboratory results show evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia. He has been treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
* The patient's lipase levels have been trending downward, possibly due to ethanol or propofol with increased triglycerides. His abdomen is somewhat firm but not tense, and he is tolerating tube feeds.
* The patient's anemia is likely due to nutritional deficiency or ethanol abuse, and he has no evidence of bleeding.
* The patient's acute renal failure has resolved with IVF, likely pre-renal.
* The patient's EtOH abuse is extensive, and he has been endorsed by his partner as being sober for years, but recently fell off the wagon.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to MSSA infection
* Pancreatitis due to ethanol or propofol with increased triglycerides
* Anemia due to nutritional deficiency or ethanol abuse
* Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to pre-renal acute renal failure
* EtOH withdrawal syndrome due to extensive EtOH abuse
* Infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections due to compromised immune system
* Gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding due to ethanol abuse and nutritional deficiency
* Cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, tachycardia, or arrhythmias due to EtOH withdrawal or other medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 282 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including Haldol, Lorazepam, and Morphine, for agitation and sedation. The patient is also receiving antibiotics for a possible infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can lead to complications such as heart failure, kidney damage, and cerebral hemorrhage.
4. Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis can worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and kidney damage.
5. Infection: The patient's self-extubation and possible infection can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media.
6. Sedation: The patient's sedation can lead to complications such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.
   Morphine worked well for agitation last night.
   - d/w psychiatry Haldol for sedation v other med
   - send CK
   - psych to see and re-[**Month/Day (2) **] when more oriented
   - consider other causes for AMS: consider checking ammonia, Hepatitis
   panel, RPR, HIV, HSV, possibly LP?
   #Fever: to 101.2 last night: pulmonary vs urine vs line vs sepsis vs
   NMS. UA w/hematuria but likely [**12-26**] to foley manipulation during
   agitation.
   -NMS studies as described
   -UCx, BCx sent last night
   -to repeat CXR
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - Repeat CXR
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to trend lipase as patient tolerates POs
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.
   Morphine worked well for agitation last night.

   #Fever: to 101.2 last night: pulmonary vs urine vs line vs sepsis vs
   NMS. UA w/hematuria but likely [**12-26**] to foley manipulation during
   agitation.
   -NMS studies as described
   -UCx, BCx sent last night
   -to repeat CXR
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - Repeat CXR
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to trend lipase as patient tolerates POs
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, currently admitted to the ICU due to somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia aspiration event. The patient has been experiencing agitation, fever, and hypertension, which may be related to ethanol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness.

The patient has been managed with standing and PRN Haldol for agitation, and has also been given Zyprexa for agitation, which can cause NMS. The patient's fever is unclear in origin, with possibilities including pulmonary, urinary, or line-related causes.

The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. The patient has a history of pancreatitis, with lipase trending downward, possibly related to ethanol or propofol use.

The patient has a history of anemia, which is likely related to nutritional deficiency or ethanol abuse. The patient is currently tolerating tube feeds and has been replete with electrolytes as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) due to the use of Haldol and Zyprexa.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and potential urinary tract infection.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia.
4. Pancreatitis or worsening pancreatitis due to the patient's history of pancreatitis and potential ethanol or propofol use.
5. Anemia or worsening anemia due to the patient's history of anemia and potential nutritional deficiency or ethanol abuse.
6. Ethanol withdrawal syndrome due to the patient's history of alcoholism and recent ethanol use.
7. Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome due to the patient's recent use of benzodiazepines.
8. Delirium or altered mental status due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential medication use.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and potential sepsis or septic shock.
2. Continue to manage the patient's agitation with Haldol and other medications as needed.
3. Consider repeating the patient's CXR and UCx and BCx to rule out pneumonia or other infections.
4. Continue to treat the patient's pancreatitis with antibiotics and other medications as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation or treatment as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to addiction services and social work for further evaluation and treatment of his ethanol abuse.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further evaluation or treatment as needed.
8. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment of his depression and other mental health conditions."

   do not appear to be triggered events and have been responsive primarily
   to time rather than specific intervention.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Controlling metabolic alkalosis with KCl
   -Continue with Unasyn Rx for possible pneumonia
   -Nebs PRN and standing
   2)Agitation--These episodes are characterized by confusion, agitation,
   hypertension, tachycardia and have been responsive to haldol dosing
   -Haldol 2.5mg tid and PRN has worked reasonably
   -Will need to track the episodes and if dominated by autonomic
   activation will have to re-consider benzodiazepine dosing
   -Would consider catechol studies if this hypertension dominates events
   -NMS, Serotonin Syndrome all must be considered but his episodes have
   been paroxysmal
   -Will check--RPR, B12, LFT's, Amonia
   -Will have Psychiatry in to evaluate patient for above possibilities
   and to consider therapeutic intervetions
   -Will Rx with clonidine for autonomic activation if that evolves as
   dominant pattern over time
   -Will utilize Haldol and move to PRN dosing if concern remains for
   paradoxical reaction over time but has been primary [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -Will utilize MSO4 PRN for pain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo male with polysubstance ingestion and respiratory failure now
   with extubation and improving mental status following decreased in
   benzo dosing.  Last night patient with signfiicant paroxysms of
   agitation, confusion, and intermittent fevers across the night--these
   do not appear to be triggered events and have been responsive primarily
   to time rather than specific intervention.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Controlling metabolic alkalosis with KCl
   -Continue with Unasyn Rx for possible pneumonia
   -Nebs PRN and standing
   2)Agitation--These episodes are characterized by confusion, agitation,
   hypertension, tachycardia and have been responsive to haldol dosing
   -Haldol 2.5mg tid and PRN has worked reasonably
   -Will need to track the episodes and if dominated by autonomic
   activation will have to re-consider benzodiazepine dosing
   -Would consider catechol studies if this hypertension dominates events
   -NMS, Serotonin Syndrome all must be considered but his episodes have
   been paroxysmal
   -Will check--RPR, B12, LFT's, Amonia
   -Will have Psychiatry in to evaluate patient for above possibilities
   and to consider therapeutic intervetions
   -Will Rx with clonidine for autonomic activation if that evolves as
   dominant pattern over time
   -Will utilize Haldol and move to PRN dosing if concern remains for
   paradoxical reaction over time but has been primary [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   -Will utilize MSO4 PRN for pain
   3)Fever-
   -Cultures sent
   -Antibiotics continuing
   -Will Check CXR

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and intoxication. He was previously intubated but was extubated due to improved ability to clear secretions and maintain oxygenation with nasal cannula alone. He experienced paroxysms of hypertension, agitation, and fever across the night, which were responsive to time rather than specific intervention. His vital signs are stable, and he is able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying condition.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation is a concern, and he is at risk for developing NMS, Serotonin Syndrome, or other conditions that may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is of unknown origin and may be a sign of infection or other underlying condition.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, and he is at risk for developing cardiovascular complications.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is being managed with KCl, but he is at risk for developing other electrolyte imbalances.
6. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his underlying condition and the presence of secretions in his airway.
7. Catechol Studies: The patient's hypertension may require further evaluation with catechol studies to determine the cause of his hypertension.
8. NMS, Serotonin Syndrome: The patient is at risk for developing NMS or Serotonin Syndrome due to his medication regimen and underlying condition.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his intubation and presence of secretions in his airway.
10. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobility and presence of central lines.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's agitation with Haldol and consider other interventions as necessary.
3. Continue to investigate the cause of the patient's fever and manage it accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medication and consider further evaluation with catechol studies.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and manage any imbalances that arise.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation with imaging studies to rule out other underlying conditions.
8. Consider transferring the patient to the floor if his condition continues to improve overnight and he requires a 1:1 sitter."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a [**age**]-year-old, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of delirium/confusion, fever, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The patient's 24-hour events include a fall at 9:00 PM on [**2173-10-7**], during which they were found on the floor next to their bed. The patient was given more Haldol and was put back to bed. Their neuro exam was stable, and they were placed on a sitter.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 80 bpm
* Blood pressure: 149/81 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-8.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7-9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 17-25.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103-159 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 282 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Delirium/confusion
* Fever of unknown origin
* Hypertension
* Mixed acidosis
* Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Hypertensive crisis
* Acidosis
* Delirium/confusion
* Hypothermia
* Pneumonia
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulcer
* Malnutrition
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Cardiovascular complications

Based on the patient's lab results and medical history, it appears that they are at risk for developing sepsis, respiratory failure, and acidosis. The patient's delirium/confusion and fever of unknown origin also increase their risk for developing complications. The patient's hypertension and mixed acidosis also require close monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. Per psych, this is unlikely to be NMS and more likely to be
   delirium from medication intoxication or EtOH withdrawal.  CK elevated
   at 900s but not in range of NMS.  Hepatitis panel pending, RPR
   negative.
   - continue Haldol for agitation
   - f/u psych recs
   - f/u hepatitis panel
   .
   #Fever: Tmax 101 from yesterday morning.  Low-grade temps during the
   day.  Likely due to aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, possibly from
   medication overdose.  CXR same, possibly slightly worse.
   - continue to follow cultures, antibiotics are Unasyn
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   .
   #Pancreatitis: resolved.
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - f/u psych recs
   .
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding. Currently stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. Per psych, this is unlikely to be NMS and more likely to be
   delirium from medication intoxication or EtOH withdrawal.  CK elevated
   at 900s but not in range of NMS.  Hepatitis panel pending, RPR
   negative.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of alcoholism and depression who presents with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: The patient's agitation is likely due to EtOH withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, or other toxic ingestions, or delirium from medical illness. The patient is currently being managed with standing and PRN Haldol, which seems to be responsive.
2. Fever: The patient has a Tmax of 101°F, which is likely due to aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, possibly from medication overdose. The patient's CXR is same, possibly slightly worse.
3. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hypoxia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA, with a mucous plug also possible. The patient is being treated with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coag-positive staph.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis has resolved.
5. ETOH Abuse: The patient's partner endorses that the patient has been sober for years, but the patient has recently fallen off the wagon. The patient is potentially experiencing extensive withdrawal symptoms.
6. Anemia: The patient has an anemia likely due to nutritional deficiency and ETOH abuse. The patient is currently stable, but the anemia needs to be trended.
7. FEN: The patient is tolerating POs and is replete with lytes as needed, with thiamine administered daily.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia increase the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates increase the risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension increase the risk of developing cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's EtOH withdrawal and potential benzo withdrawal increase the risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures and delirium.
5. Infection: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia increase the risk of developing infections such as pneumonia and sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis and potential gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis and bowel obstruction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.
   Morphine worked well for agitation last night.
   - d/w psychiatry Haldol for sedation v other med
   - send CK
   - psych to see and re-eval when more oriented
   - consider other causes for AMS: consider checking ammonia, Hepatitis
   panel, RPR, HIV, HSV, possibly LP?
   #Fever: to 101.2 last night: pulmonary vs urine vs line vs sepsis vs
   NMS. UA w/hematuria but likely [**12-26**] to foley manipulation during
   agitation.
   -NMS studies as described
   -UCx, BCx sent last night
   -to repeat CXR
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - Repeat CXR
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to trend lipase as patient tolerates POs
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 1901**] is a 55 yo M with PMH of alcholism, depression who
   presents with somnolence, bradycardia and hypotension after likely
   intoxication and ingestion as well as hypoxia [**12-26**] aspiration event.
   .
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation:  possibly due to EtOH withdrawal,
   benzo withdrawal, other toxic ingestions, delirium from medical
   illness.  Benzodiazapines were d/c for concern of toxicity.  Currently
   being managed with standing and PRN Haldol and seems to be responsive
   to this. W/episodes last night of agitation + htn + tachycardia + fever
   that escalated w/haldol administration, possibility of NMS (patient
   also given zyprexa for agitation, and took seroquel outpt, both of
   which can cause NMS).  Also possible that Haldol dosing is inadequate
   and fever is incidental.  Likely AMS/delirium is multifactorial.
   Morphine worked well for agitation last night.
   - d/w psychiatry Haldol for sedation v other med
   - send CK
   - psych to see and re-eval when more oriented
   - consider other causes for AMS: consider checking ammonia, Hepatitis
   panel, RPR, HIV, HSV, possibly LP?
   #Fever: to 101.2 last night: pulmonary vs urine vs line vs sepsis vs
   NMS. UA w/hematuria but likely [**12-26**] to foley manipulation during
   agitation.
   -NMS studies as described
   -UCx, BCx sent last night
   -to repeat CXR
   .
   # Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/hyppoxia - likely [**12-26**] aspiration
   pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA.  Mucous plug also possible although
   minimal secretions on suctioning.   Bronchoscopy benign for aspirated
   material, growing MSSA.
   - Continue to treat with unasyn to cover for aspiration/ coag + staph
   - Repeat CXR
   .
   #Pancreatitis: Lipase continues to trend downward.  Possibly due to
   EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.  Trending down now that
   Propofol is decreased and discontinued however unclear relationship.
   Abdomen somewhat firm but not tense.  Tolerating tube feeds.
   - continue to trend lipase as patient tolerates POs
   .
   #ETOH Abuse
s partner endorses that pt. has been sober for years,
   and only recently
fell off the wagon.
  The extent of his withdrawal,
   however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much more
   extensive.
   - Ranitidine for GI protection
   - Addiction consult + Social Work once awake
   - Monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   - psych needs to eval pt. once he is awake and clear
   ..
   #Anemia - baseline HCT 40 according to recent records, borderline
   macrocytic therefore anemia likely [**12-26**] nutritional deficiency [**12-26**] ETOH
   abuse.  No evidence of bleeding. Currently stable

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and depression, was admitted to the ICU with somnolence, bradycardia, and hypotension after likely intoxication and ingestion, as well as hypoxia and aspiration event. The patient has been managed with standing and PRN Haldol for agitation, and Morphine worked well for agitation last night. The patient has also been treated for bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia, which is likely aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and fever, which may be due to EtOH withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or other toxic ingestions. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to EtOH abuse. The patient has also been experiencing anemia, which may be related to nutritional deficiency or EtOH abuse.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: likely due to EtOH withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or other toxic ingestions.
2. Fever: likely due to pulmonary, urine, or line infection, or NMS.
3. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/Hypoxia: likely aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
4. Pancreatitis: possible due to EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.
5. ETOH Abuse: patient has been sober for years, but recently fell off the wagon.
6. Anemia: likely nutritional deficiency or EtOH abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome): due to Haldol administration.
2. Sepsis: due to potential infection.
3. Respiratory failure: due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
4. Pancreatitis: due to EtOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides.
5. Worsening of anemia: due to continued EtOH abuse or nutritional deficiency.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to manage agitation with Haldol and Morphine.
2. Repeat CXR to evaluate pulmonary infiltrates.
3. Continue to treat with Unasyn to cover for aspiration and coagulopathy.
4. Monitor for ETOH withdrawal and consider addiction consult and social work.
5. Evaluate patient's mental status and consider psychiatric consultation.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory failure.
7. Continue to trend lipase levels and consider pancreatitis treatment.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of anemia and consider nutritional support.
9. Consider performing a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out meningitis.
10. Monitor for signs of NMS and consider dopamine agonist treatment if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and intoxication. He was successfully extubated and is showing slow but consistent improvement in mental status. The patient has a history of delirium, and psychiatry support has been ordered to manage his condition. He is being treated for fever of unknown origin, hypertension, and mixed acidosis. The patient has a sub-conjunctival hemorrhage and is being monitored for respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a significant concern and requires close monitoring. If left untreated, delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical concern, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further deterioration. Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary embolism are potential complications.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's fever is a significant concern, and it is essential to identify the underlying cause to prevent further complications. If left untreated, fever can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a significant concern, and it is essential to manage it to prevent further complications. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and stroke.
5. Mixed Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis is a significant concern, and it is essential to manage it to prevent further complications. If left untreated, acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Sub-conjunctival Hemorrhage: The patient's sub-conjunctival hemorrhage is a significant concern, and it is essential to monitor it closely to prevent further complications. If left untreated, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage can lead to vision loss and increased risk of infection.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is a significant concern, and it is essential to treat it aggressively to prevent further complications. Pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
8. VAP: The patient's VAP is a significant concern, and it is essential to manage it aggressively to prevent further complications. VAP can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including delirium, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, hypertension, mixed acidosis, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage, pneumonia, and VAP. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage his condition aggressively to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."
