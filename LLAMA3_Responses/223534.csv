   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - consider cath
   - on lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (Now Day 5, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: Diabetic diet with soft consistency and thin liquids ([**2-14**]
   dentures, passed video swallow) as well as boost glucose supplements,
   NPO after midnight for colonoscopy tomorrow, lytes PRN, IVF/blood
   products PRN, nutrition following
   - AM K = 3.6 -> 40 meq K over 4h through PICC
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The cardiac arrest was likely due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction. The patient was in cardiogenic shock and required pressors to maintain blood pressure. He also has a presumed epidural abscess and bacteremia, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient has a history of peptic ulcers and was supposed to have a colonoscopy, but it was postponed due to his cardiac arrest. He has a wound on his right foot that is being treated by podiatry and vascular surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac tamponade.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsive state and arctic sun protocol may lead to further neurological complications, such as seizures, brain edema, and increased intracranial pressure.
3. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and epidural abscess may lead to further infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's peptic ulcers and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
5. Wound complications: The patient's wound on his right foot may lead to further complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and non-healing.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from antibiotics may lead to further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and potential respiratory muscle weakness may lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and treat any cardiac complications promptly.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust the arctic sun protocol as necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infections and bacteremia with antibiotics.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and treat any gastrointestinal complications promptly.
5. Monitor the patient's wound and treat any wound complications promptly.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust antibiotics and other medications as necessary to minimize nephrotoxicity.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat any respiratory complications promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   .
   .
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an anteroseptal infarction. He has been diagnosed with a presumed acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is being treated with medical management, including aspirin, heparin, and beta-blockers.

The patient has also been diagnosed with a bacteremia/epidural abscess, which is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is being monitored for bleeding. He has multiple comorbidities, including peripheral vascular disease, which is being managed with wound care and vascular recs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and presumed ACS increase his risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Infection: The patient's bacteremia/epidural abscess increases his risk for sepsis, septic shock, and meningitis.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing bleeding risk increase his risk for further bleeding complications, such as hematemesis, melena, or perforation.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological signs, including altered mental status and decreased sensation in his lower extremities, increase his risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or spinal cord injury.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status, including his need for invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy, increases his risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's decreased urine output and ongoing fluid management increase his risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's history of bleeding complications and ongoing bleeding risk increase his risk for hematological complications, such as anemia, bleeding diathesis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

These potential medical complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize their impact on the patient's outcome."

   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities

   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - CK is flat, trop is mildly elevated (likely from leak/compression).
   - MRI of spine: 2.5 cm (CC) relatively thick rim-enhancing fluid
   collection, dorsal to and significantly compressing the thecal sac and
   centered at the L5 level - epidural abscess. At least two small
   rim-enhancing fluid collections the right paraspinal muscles, likely
   representing small focal abscess, which may relate to septic
   arthritis of the right L4-L5 facet joint. (neurosurgery is aware).

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after the cardiac arrest and is currently receiving medical management for presumed acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypotension, and bacteremia/epidural abscess.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by ACS, which led to anteroseptal infarction. He is receiving medical management with ASA and heparin, and will be added on beta blockers and ACE inhibitors when his blood pressure stabilizes. He is also being treated for bacteremia/epidural abscess with vancomycin and cefepime, and will be followed up with neurosurgery.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, as he is unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli and is undergoing arctic sun protocol. He is also being monitored for neurological improvement.

The patient's peripheral vascular disease is being managed with wound care and is being followed up with podiatry and vascular surgery.

The patient's type 2 diabetes is being managed with diet control and is being followed up with his primary care physician.

The patient's depression is being managed with celexa and social work is being asked to check-in.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and presumed ACS put him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli and his undergoing arctic sun protocol put him at risk for further neurological deterioration, such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and brain death.
3. Infection: The patient's bacteremia/epidural abscess put him at risk for further infection, such as sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his being on anticoagulant therapy put him at risk for further bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding complications.
5. Wound complications: The patient's peripheral vascular disease and his having multiple surgeries put him at risk for wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and non-healing.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support and his being on mechanical ventilation put him at risk for respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his being on anticoagulant therapy put him at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
8. Renal complications: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and his being on anticoagulant therapy put him at risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: defer until after cooling
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   DVT ppx: Heparin SC, holding coumadin
   -Bowel regimen: senna, colace, bisacodyl
   -GI PPx: IV PPI
   -Pain management with: percocet, acetaminophen, and lidocaine patch PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The 78-year-old male patient was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an anteroseptal infarction. He has a history of coronary artery disease, severe peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac status is unstable, with a recent episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and a new hypokinetic area in the anterior septal region on echocardiogram.

The patient is receiving treatment for his cardiac condition, including anticoagulation with heparin and aspirin, as well as beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy. He is also receiving antibiotic therapy for a presumed bacteremia and epidural abscess, which was detected on MRI.

The patient's neurological status is compromised, with unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli. He is undergoing an Arctic Sun protocol to treat his hypothermia and is being monitored for neurological improvement.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is also concerning, with a history of peptic ulcer disease and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He is receiving treatment with pantoprazole and metronidazole, and his hemoglobin level is stable.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, with multiple surgeries and ulcers on his feet. He is receiving wound care and is at risk for further complications.

The patient's diabetes is well-controlled, with a recent hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7%. He is receiving diabetic diet and medication therapy.

The patient's mesothelioma is a concern, with pleural thickening detected on chest CT and bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis on CXR.

The patient's depression is a concern, given his multiple medical issues and procedures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for further cardiac arrests.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, and is at risk for further infections.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and he is at risk for further neurological decline.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and a recent gastrointestinal bleed, and is at risk for further bleeding.
5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, and is at risk for further complications, including amputation.
6. Mesothelioma: The patient's mesothelioma is a concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure.
7. Depression: The patient's depression is a concern, and he is at risk for further complications, including suicidal ideation.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study

   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely due to anteroseptal infarction. He has been treated with various medications, including dopamine, fentanyl, and midazolam, and has undergone various interventions, including arterial line placement and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 97%. His neurological status is impaired, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 and a lack of response to verbal stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to anteroseptal infarction, and he may be at risk for future cardiac arrests if his underlying cardiac condition is not addressed.
2. Infection: The patient has a bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which may recur if his anticoagulation therapy is not managed carefully.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is impaired, and he may be at risk for further neurological decline if his underlying condition is not addressed.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, including DVT and PE, due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
6. Wound Complications: The patient has a wound on his medial plantar right foot, which may become infected or develop complications if not managed properly.
7. Asbestos-Related Complications: The patient has a history of asbestos exposure, which may lead to asbestos-related complications, including mesothelioma.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which may exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and impact his quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his therapy as necessary to prevent future cardiac arrests.
2. Continue to manage the patient's bacteremia and GI bleeding with antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his therapy as necessary to prevent further neurological decline.
4. Continue to manage the patient's thromboembolic risk with anticoagulation therapy and consider prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings.
5. Monitor the patient's wound closely and adjust his therapy as necessary to prevent wound complications.
6. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his respiratory status.
7. Consider referring the patient to a thoracic surgeon for further evaluation and management of his asbestos-related complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's depression and consider referral to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 6, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and is currently receiving treatment for various conditions.

The patient's cardiac status is a concern, with a presumed anteroseptal infarction and new-onset ventricular tachycardia (VT). He is being treated with anticoagulation therapy and is at risk for bleeding. The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli, and he is undergoing an Arctic Sun protocol to monitor for neurological improvement.

The patient has a history of bacteremia and an epidural abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics, and he is at risk for further complications. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being monitored closely.

The patient's peripheral vascular disease is being managed with wound care and vascular recs, and he has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is being managed with diet and medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is a concern, and he is at risk for further cardiac arrest.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli is a concern, and he may continue to deteriorate neurologically.
3. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, and he is at risk for further infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further complications, such as perforation or obstruction.
6. Peripheral vascular complications: The patient's peripheral vascular disease is being managed with wound care and vascular recs, and he is at risk for further complications, such as gangrene or amputation.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday

   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation who was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a presumed acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with new hypokinetic areas in the anterior septal region on echocardiogram. He also has a bacteremia/epidural abscess, a gastrointestinal bleed, and a history of peptic ulcers. He is receiving antibiotics for MSSA and has a pending MRI for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to the ACS and VT arrest
	* Further cardiac arrhythmias due to the underlying cardiac disease and medication side effects
2. Neurological complications:
	* Neurological decline due to the VT arrest and possible hypoxic-ischemic injury
	* Seizures or status epilepticus due to the underlying medical conditions and medication side effects
3. Infection-related complications:
	* Bacteremia/epidural abscess progression and potential spread to other sites
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to the underlying infections
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Further bleeding or perforation due to the underlying peptic ulcers and GI bleed
	* Nutritional deficiencies due to the patient's inability to eat and the need for total parenteral nutrition
5. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying respiratory disease and prolonged intubation
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation
6. Hematological complications:
	* Bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction
	* Anemia or bleeding due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medication side effects
7. Endocrine complications:
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and medication side effects
	* Adrenal insufficiency or hyperadrenalism due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medication side effects"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and ventricular tachycardia. He is receiving dopamine and phenylephrine infusions to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli. He is undergoing an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and is being monitored for neurological improvement.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. His white blood cell count is elevated, and his creatinine level is slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent GI bleed, for which he is being monitored for bleeding and is receiving pantoprazole and metronidazole infusions. He also has a history of skin ulcers and is being treated for a possible bacteremia or epidural abscess.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing cardiovascular instability and elevated troponin-T levels increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac rupture.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli and his ongoing Arctic Sun cooling protocol increase the risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, or stroke.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible bacteremia or epidural abscess increase the risk of infection, including sepsis or septic shock.
4. GI complications: The patient's history of GI bleed and ongoing pantoprazole and metronidazole infusions increase the risk of GI complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
5. Wound complications: The patient's history of skin ulcers and ongoing wound care increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and ongoing cardiovascular and neurological instability. He requires close monitoring and aggressive management of his underlying conditions to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch-tall, 110.5 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of bacteremia, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management medications, and heparin. They have also been receiving dopamine and fentanyl infusions to support their hemodynamic and respiratory status. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.5, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 189 K/uL. Their blood chemistry results are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated creatinine level. 

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their unstable condition, and they are not able to move or respond to stimuli. 

The patient's assessment and plan include bacteremia, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and impaired skin integrity increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulopathy.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest increase their risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure increase their risk of developing respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and ongoing fluid resuscitation increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
6. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase their risk of developing secondary infections, such as wound infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's impaired neurological status and ongoing sedation increase their risk of developing neurological complications, such as delirium, seizures, and brain injury.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications and to improve the patient's outcomes."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10807**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated off pressors.
   Alert and communicative.
   Moves upper and lower ext to command.
   review of strips from arrest now suggests that rhythm may not be vent
   tachycardia but sinus tach with aberrrancy with primary mechanism PEA
   arrest.
   Medical Decision Making
   Neurosurgery planning drainage of epidural abscess tomorrow.
   Pt s/p CABG with no recent evidence of ischemia so no cardiac
   contraindication to proposed surgery.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 78-year-old male, is a transfer from the cardiac arrest unit to the ICU. He has a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, which was successfully stopped on 11/23/2174.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.8°C (96.4°F)
* Heart rate: 63 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 172/77 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 222 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 91 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 262 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and a 1-cm abscess on MRI. Neurosurgery is planning to drain the abscess tomorrow.
* GI bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed on 11/15/2174, and his hemoglobin level has stabilized since then.
* Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and currently has an ulcer on his medial plantar right foot.
* Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes is diet-controlled, and his last HbA1c level was 5.7%.
* Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening on chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
* Depression: The patient is taking celexa 20 mg daily and has a history of multiple medical issues and procedures.

The patient's plan includes:

* Repletion of magnesium, calcium, and potassium as needed
* Monitoring for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and bleeding
* Possible placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) once other comorbidities have stabilized
* Neurological consultation for further evaluation and management
* Wound care for the ulcer on his medial plantar right foot
* Follow-up with thoracic surgery for further evaluation and management of mesothelioma
* Continued celexa therapy for depression
* Tube feeds and IV access for nutrition and hydration

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Infection: The patient has a bacteremia and an epidural abscess, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is at risk for further bleeding due to his underlying conditions.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, which may lead to cardiac complications if not properly managed.
* Respiratory complications: The patient was recently extubated and may be at risk for respiratory complications if his underlying conditions are not properly managed.
* Wound complications: The patient has an ulcer on his medial plantar right foot, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
* Psychological complications: The patient has a history of depression and may be at risk for further psychological complications if not properly managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 6, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday

   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).

   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest and is currently on invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 172/77 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a face tent with 40% FiO2.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, presumed to be due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction. He has also had a gastrointestinal bleed, which is being managed with transfusions and antacids. He has a wound on his medial plantar right foot that is being managed with wound care.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, consistent with myocardial infarction, as well as elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, consistent with kidney dysfunction. His white blood cell count is 7.5 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 222 x 10^9/L.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and presumed ACS puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's use of invasive ventilation and his history of pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and his use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.
4. Infection: The patient's history of bacteremia and his use of antibiotics put him at risk for infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and his use of sedatives and analgesics put him at risk for neurological complications, including seizures and brain damage.
6. Wound complications: The patient's wound on his medial plantar right foot is at risk for complications, including infection and necrosis.
7. Kidney complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels put him at risk for kidney complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and his current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 78-year-old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.
* He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an unclear etiology, possibly related to anesthetic for an MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.
* The patient has undergone multiple surgeries, including CABG, and has a history of pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis.
* He has been diagnosed with bacteremia and an epidural abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics.
* The patient has also experienced a gastrointestinal bleed and has been transfused with blood products.
* He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been extubated without complication.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Cardiovascular complications:
	+ Continued decompensated LV dysfunction
	+ Coagulopathy
	+ Electrolyte abnormalities
* Neurological complications:
	+ Seizures or status epilepticus due to electrolyte imbalance or infection
	+ Neurological sequelae from cardiac arrest
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	+ Respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal complications:
	+ Further bleeding or perforation
	+ Infection or abscess formation
* Infections:
	+ Sepsis or septic shock
	+ Infection of the epidural abscess
* Other complications:
	+ DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility
	+ Mesothelioma or asbestosis-related complications
	+ Depression or anxiety due to multiple medical issues and procedures

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient is at risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple comorbidities.
* The patient's cardiac arrest is unclear in etiology, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
* The patient's bacteremia and epidural abscess require continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection.
* The patient's gastrointestinal bleed requires ongoing transfusion and management of bleeding risk factors.
* The patient's peripheral vascular disease requires ongoing wound care and management of ulceration.
* The patient's type 2 diabetes requires ongoing management of blood sugar levels and diet.
* The patient's possible mesothelioma or asbestosis requires further evaluation and follow-up with thoracic surgery.

Overall, the patient requires a multidisciplinary approach to manage his complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. His current medications include beta blockers, anticoagulants, and antibiotics. He is receiving tube feeds and has a history of GI bleeding, which is being managed with pantoprazole and metronidazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest may have been caused by a variety of factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, decompensated LV dysfunction, or anesthetic effects. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological signs, including altered mental status, which may be related to his cardiac arrest or other underlying conditions. He may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, which may have been caused by skin ulcers or other sources. He may be at risk for further infectious complications, such as sepsis or meningitis.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which may be related to his type II diabetes or other underlying conditions. He may be at risk for further GI complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a history of wounds on his medial plantar right foot, which may be at risk for further complications, such as infection or necrosis.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
7. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate underlying kidney disease or acute kidney injury. He may be at risk for further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including cardiac, neurological, infectious, gastrointestinal, wound, respiratory, and renal complications. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement

   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and is currently being treated for several conditions, including bacteremia/epidural abscess, GI bleed, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's medical history includes multiple surgeries, including CABG and repair of skin ulcers. He has a history of peptic ulcers and is currently being treated with pantoprazole and metronidazole. He also has a history of depression and is taking celexa.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology, but likely related to anesthetic for MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.
* Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive for MSSA, but source unclear. Plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.
* GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic ulcers that are healing.
* Peripheral vascular disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with ulcer on medial plantar right foot.
* Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%.
*? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: Continued monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac complications.
2. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: Increased risk of sepsis, abscess rupture, and potential neurological complications.
3. GI bleed: Continued risk of bleeding, potential for GI perforation, and risk of electrolyte imbalances.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: Risk of further complications, such as gangrene or amputation.
5. Type 2 diabetes: Risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, potential for diabetic ketoacidosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB it was decided that we would instead treat
   with full-strength ASA (from 81 mg) for 4 weeks, with plan to lower
   down to 81 mg after 4 weeks for prevention of CVA.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an unknown etiology. The patient has undergone several procedures, including cardiac catheterization, and has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, heparin, and antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 64 bpm, BP 107/55 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 93%
* Laboratory results: WBC 7.5 K/uL, Hct 30.3%, Plt 222 K/uL, Cr 1.2 mg/dL, TCO2 22 mmHg, Glucose 89 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: Head CT unremarkable, MRI positive for 1 cm abscess in the brain
* Medical history: S/p CABG, s/p cardiac arrest, s/p GIB, s/p multiple surgeries for peripheral vascular disease
* Current medications: Beta blockers, heparin, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, metronidazole, tetracycline, celexa
* Current treatments: IV fluids, oxygen therapy, tube feeds, pain management with dilaudid PRN

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for bleeding due to his coagulopathy and use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive MRI for an abscess in the brain and is at risk for developing further infections.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for developing further cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to his underlying lung disease and use of oxygen therapy.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
7. Renal complications: The patient has a history of kidney disease and is at risk for developing further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Infectious complications: The patient has a positive MRI for an abscess in the brain and is at risk for developing further infections, such as sepsis or meningitis.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition make him at risk for a variety of potential medical complications. It is essential to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Bacteremia/epidural abscess: Positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a 1-cm abscess on MRI.
* GI bleed: S/p gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) on [**2174-11-15**], with HCT stable since then.
* Peripheral vascular disease: S/p multiple surgeries, with an ulcer on the medial plantar right foot.
* Type 2 diabetes: Diet-controlled, with last HbA1c 5.7%.
*? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening on chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
* Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may be difficult.

The patient's current medications include:

* Beta blocker: 25 mg po q6h
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 0.2 mg IV q4h
* Pantoprazole (Protonix): 8 mg/hour IV
* Heparin sodium: 900 units/hour IV
* Metronidazole: 500 mg IV q8h
* Cefazolin: 1 g IV q8h

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB it was decided that we would instead treat
   with full-strength ASA (from 81 mg) for 4 weeks, with plan to lower
   down to 81 mg after 4 weeks for prevention of CVA.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, and his current condition is stable. He has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for IR-guided drainage of the abscess. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being managed with IV fluids and medication. He has multiple medical issues, including depression, and is being treated with medication and therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, and is at risk for developing further infections, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the setting of his anticoagulation therapy.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, and is at risk for developing further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological symptoms, including confusion and delirium, and is at risk for developing further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and is at risk for developing wound complications, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of respiratory symptoms, including pneumonia, and is at risk for developing further respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Renal complications: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for developing further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI).
8. Hepatic complications: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for developing further hepatic complications, such as liver failure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   - appearrs at baseline
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   - NSG on monday
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a recent cardiac arrest. He was transferred to the ICU after the cardiac arrest and has been receiving treatment for several conditions, including bacteremia, epidural abscess, atrial fibrillation, GI bleed, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's recent events include the removal of an arterial line and a multi-lumen line, which yielded 1cc of purulent/bloody fluid. He has also undergone an I/R procedure and is scheduled for an NSG procedure tomorrow. His pain management has been switched to oxycodone, and his Flagyl has been changed to IV to reduce pill burden.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/76 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. He has a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg and a total fluid balance of -529 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's recent I/R procedure and bacteremia may have caused coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
2. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's recent cardiac arrest and electrolyte imbalances may have caused electrolyte abnormalities, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed and bacteremia may have caused bleeding complications, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and epidural abscess may have caused infection, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation may have caused cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent cardiac arrest and neurological signs may have caused neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.
7. Wound complications: The patient's recent surgical procedures and wound care may have caused wound complications, such as infection and dehiscence.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and electrolyte levels closely to prevent coagulopathy and electrolyte abnormalities.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and infection status closely to prevent bleeding complications and infection.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort effectively to prevent pain-related complications.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac and neurological status closely to prevent cardiac complications and neurological complications.
5. Continue to provide wound care and monitor the patient's wound status closely to prevent wound complications.
6. Consider further testing, such as echocardiogram and stress test, to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and identify potential cardiac complications.
7. Consider further evaluation, such as MRI and CT scans, to evaluate the patient's neurological status and identify potential neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   - appearrs at baseline
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   - NSG on monday
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, and the etiology of the arrest is unclear.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and a 1-cm abscess on MRI. The source of the infection is unclear, but it is suspected to be related to skin ulcers.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which converted to sinus rhythm after a shock during the cardiac arrest. The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
3. GI bleed: The patient had a GIB on November 15 and is currently being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antibiotics.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and currently has an ulcer on his medial plantar right foot.
5. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes is diet-controlled, and he has not required insulin while in the hospital.
6. Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening on a chest CT scan, which is concerning for mesothelioma.
7. Depression: The patient is experiencing depression due to his multiple medical issues and procedures.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   - NSG on monday
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # elevated INR: Patient noted to have uptrending INR during
   hospitalization despite being off coumadin since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-14**]
   nutritional deficiencies.  Will give PO Vit K.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 10, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.

   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA

   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an unknown etiology, possibly related to anesthetic, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including bacteremia/epidural abscess, atrial fibrillation, elevated INR, GI bleed, and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and he is at risk of bleeding due to his comorbidities, including bacteremia/epidural abscess and GI bleed.
2. Infection: The patient has a bacteremia/epidural abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics and may require further surgical intervention.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is at risk of further bleeding due to his comorbidities.
5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may lead to further complications, such as gangrene or amputation.
6. Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening and bilateral calcified pleural plaques, which are concerning for mesothelioma.
7. Depression: The patient's multiple medical issues and procedures may lead to depression, which may require further management.
8. Wound complications: The patient's wound on his medial plantar right foot is at risk of complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutrition may lead to further deficiencies, which may impact his overall health.
10. Medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications, which may interact with each other and lead to adverse effects.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's INR and coagulation status closely to prevent bleeding.
2. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Manage the patient's GI bleed and consider further endoscopy or surgery if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease and consider further interventions if necessary.
6. Consider further testing to rule out mesothelioma.
7. Continue depression management and consider further therapy if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's wound and consider further interventions if necessary.
9. Consider further nutritional support and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's medication interactions and adjust treatment as necessary."
